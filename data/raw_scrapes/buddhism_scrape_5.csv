I love this story so much - I'm trying to learn not to mind what others think of me - I welcome any help!,"At one time the Buddha was staying near RƒÅjagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels‚Äô feeding ground.

The brahmin BhƒÅradvƒÅja the Rude heard a rumor that a  brahmin of the BhƒÅradvƒÅja clan had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in the presence of the ascetic Gotama. Angry and displeased  he went to the Buddha and abused and insulted him with rude, harsh  words. When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him:

‚ÄúWhat do you think, brahmin? Do friends and colleagues, relatives and family members, and guests still come to visit you?‚Äù

‚ÄúSometimes they do, Master Gotama.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you then serve them with fresh and cooked foods and savories?‚Äù

‚ÄúSometimes I do.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut if they don‚Äôt accept it, brahmin, who does it belong to?‚Äù

‚ÄúIn that case it still belongs to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn the same way, brahmin, when you abuse, harass, and attack us who do not abuse, harass, and attack, we don‚Äôt accept it. It still belongs to you, brahmin, it still belongs to you!

Someone  who, when abused, harassed, and attacked, abuses, harasses, and attacks  in return is said to eat the food and have a reaction to it. But we neither eat your food nor do we have a reaction to it. It still belongs to you, brahmin, it still belongs to you!‚Äù# # #

I realized it is a slight variation to the gift story where it is food instead which I actually like a lot better because he talks about ""if you don't eat the food, do you react to it?""

I love that consuming aspect of it - because we are consuming or taking in others thoughts and options of it.  But if we don't consume it / eat it / take it in then how would we get a reaction?

Feeling doomed after the realization of our endless cycle.,"After many years spent thinking about Buddha's teachings, suddenly, the realizations start to actually ""sink"" into my own perception: I am going in circles with endless rebirths. 

I feel overwhelmingly intimidated by this recently and so suddenly - even though I know the concept of rebirth and karma long ago since I was a child. Even as time (which is a product of our own construction) goes on, I feel as if it is merely an illusion.  I am ... stuck. 

It feels like the road we are traveling on (with occasional stops to refuel - rebirth) is endless and  that going further is pointless as it never stops. It is like the mirror which is shattered... but we still need it to see ourselves.

I know it sounds crazy but, how can I deal with this, fellow Buddhists? Thank you very much.

Edit: is this nihilism thinking? Am I ""feeling doomed"" because I am conditioned to interpret in this way?",Buddhism,1705815089.0,t3_19bw34e,0.92,11
request for advice regarding my practice,"Hello, my friends

I've Already decided on tibetan buddhism but it's tough for me to actually walk the path because of certain constraints I have. 

Due to the fact that I'm still a teenager, I don't really have the freedom to go to the tibetan-buddhist temples or centres in singapore. I also can't really spend any money on any malas, statues or online courses. Only thing I can really spend money on is books. I also don't really have the luxury of being able to study under a teacher right now.

Right now, how do I walk the path of tibetan-buddhism within these constraints? How do I learn meditation practices like tonglen, vipassana, shamantha and metta in a way that is true to my specific sect which is tibetan buddhism without spending any money on courses, online or in person? 

I do have full internet access but do bear in mind that even my access to tibetan buddhist books might be indirectly restricted due to my parents, who might not want me spending too much time on something like religion and/or who might be afraid that this distracts me from my studies.

Again, I need a structured practice but it's hard to do so with so little resources. Would appreciate any advice :)

Presenting the Dharma on Social Media,"Please read this post entirely before responding in order to avoid any misunderstanding. I will try to make my intentions as clear as possible.

I am considering the possibility of setting up a social media channel in order to present the Dharma to anyone who stumbles upon it and is interested.

By 'presenting the Dharma' I specifically mean:
* Quoting Pali Canon Suttas and Mahayana Sutras.
* Mentioning useful books and online resources.
* Sharing personal experience (explicitly marked as being personal).

EDIT: I forgot to mention that I intentionally chose the word 'presenting' as in 'showing', 'sharing', 'replicating'. I am *not* speaking of *teaching* the Dharma.

I *do not* intend to do any of the following:
* Misrepresent myself as a qualified teacher.
* Misrepresent my personal views as Dharma.
* Attack other traditions or religions.
* Making money in any shape or form.
* Using unskillful methods to boost engagement (e.g. baiting people with false promises or intentionally evoking intense emotions).
* Criticizing people or trying to pressure, change or convert them.
* Engage in fruitless online discussions.
* Pursuing fame or recognition.
* Starting a new school, let alone a cult.

I am also well aware of what awaits me if I slander the Dharma or cause division in a Sangha.

In short, I intend to present the Dharma in accordance with the Dharma.

Please also note that I am not expecting anything from this. I am not emotionally attached to this project. I just want to use my abilities and means to do what's skillful.

Thanks for reading all of this. Here are my questions:
* **Is this a skillful thing to do at all?** If not, please just say so.
* **If so, did I miss anything that I should be aware of?**",Buddhism,1705842173.0,t3_19c2ypf,0.75,2

Extra Chant Verses Identification?,"Hey all,

"Some of your ancestors and deceased loved ones may have been reborn as hungry ghosts, no longer able to fend for themselves. In this poem the Buddha explains that it is to your long-term benefit ‚Äî and to theirs ‚Äî that you honor their memory with gifts.","    Outside the walls they stand,
	    & at crossroads.
    At door posts they stand,
 	    returning to their old homes.
    But when a meal with plentiful food & drink is served,
	    no one remembers them:
    Such is the kamma of living beings.

    Thus those who feel sympathy for their dead relatives
    give timely donations of proper food & drink
	    ‚Äî exquisite, clean ‚Äî
    [thinking:] ""May this be for our relatives.
		    May our relatives be happy!""

    And those who have gathered there,
	    the assembled shades of the relatives,
    with appreciation give their blessing
    for the plentiful food & drink:
	    ""May our relatives live long
	    because of whom we have gained [this gift].
	    We have been honored,
	    and the donors are not without reward!""

    For there [in their realm] there's
	    no farming,
	    no herding of cattle,
	    no commerce,
	    no trading with money.
    They live on what is given here,
	    hungry shades
	    whose time here is done.

    As water raining on a hill
    flows down to the valley,
	    even so does what is given here
	    benefit the dead.
    As rivers full of water
    fill the ocean full,
	    even so does what is given here
	    benefit the dead.

    ""He gave to me, she acted on my behalf,
	    they were my relatives, companions, friends"":
    Offerings should be given for the dead
    when one reflects thus
    on things done in the past.
    For no weeping,
	    no sorrowing
	    no other lamentation
		    benefits the dead
		    whose relatives persist in that way.
    But when this offering is given, well-placed in the Sangha,
    it works for their long-term benefit
    and they profit immediately.

    In this way 
		    the proper duty to relatives has been shown,
		    great honor has been done to the dead,
		    and monks have been given strength:

	    The merit you've acquired
		    isn't small.

Dharma is not a therapy," *It is such a mistake to assume that practicing dharma will help us calm down and lead an untroubled life; nothing could be further from the truth. Dharma is not a therapy.

If you practice and your life fails to capsize, it is a sign that what you are doing is not working. This is what distinguishes the dharma from New Age methods involving auras, relationships, communication, well-being, the Inner Child, being one with the universe, and tree hugging. From the point of view of dharma, such interests are the toys of samsaric beings ‚Äî toys that quickly bore us senseless.*

Why are humans so special?,"So much of Buddhism does seem to elevate humanity above the other animals and states of existence. It seems to me that we have a lot of territorial genetic baggage, as well as the ever growing heap of society's baggage, and a very counter-intuitive reptilian brain at the basis of our genetic upbringing. What about the other animals that might evolve intelligence in the next 100,000 years? What if they have less territorial hangups? Are they still somehow not good enough to make the cut? Dogs seem to encapsulate mindfulness, compassion, and being in the moment, and get over emotional baggage much more readily. Why aren't there dog buddhas? Is it because we can't understand their words? Isn't that hanging too much attachment on words, which we typically agree, severely limit our ability to communicate, and pedantics can take our words and ignore our meaning?

On what rational basis can one believe in Amitabha?,"There is a rational argument to be made for the salvific power of Jesus' death on the cross, which goes roughly as follows:

1. The Gospels are basically accurate historical documents. 
2. Therefore, there is good historical evidence that Jesus died on the cross and afterward appeared  and spoke to to his disciples. 
3. The best logical explanation for this is that God raised him from the dead, and he was who he claimed to be. 

Obviously this argument is not a slam dunk, or everyone would be Christian. (Personally I don't find it convincing.) But it is basically logically sound. Scholars generally agree that the Gospels are, to a greater or lesser extent, an accurate representation of what the historical Jesus did and said. There's no *a priori* reason to discount everything miraculous in them without begging the question. ""If Jesus really did miraculously cure the sick and blind, walk and water, and rise from the dead, we may reasonably conclude that he was telling the truth about being divine"" is a logically sound statement that I agree with. 

To rationally believe in Amitabha, surely we have to believe not only that the historical Buddha did have the supernormal abilities and knowledge that he claimed to have, but also that the Pure Land sutras are an accurate record of his teachings. In my opinion, the following syllogism, if true, would be of comparable strength to the Christian apologetic syllogism given above:

1. The Pure Land sutras more or less accurately reproduce actual teachings given by the historical Buddha. 
2. The historical Buddha was a philosophical genius and morally unimpeachable; what's more, there are many eyewitness accounts of his supernormal abilities and knowledge. 
3. Therefore we can conclude he was not lying and Amitabha exists.

But unlike the Gospels, whose historical accuracy is disputed in scholarly circles mostly as a matter of degree, the Pure Land sutras are generally considered by scholars *not* to be authentic records of what the historical Buddha taught. As far as I can tell, to claim otherwise, we need to argue that... 

1. Some of the Buddha's most powerful, memorable, and popularly accessible teachings were unknown to, or not transmitted by, a large community of his followers, for some unknown reason; or,
2. They were known to his disciples but not written down until far after most of his other teachings (and then written down in a very different literary style), again for an unknown reason; or,
3. They were secreted away after the Buddha's death in some miraculous manner before being revealed again later.

Unlike the Christian apologetic syllogism described above, *all* of these options, as far as I know, require some degree of blind faith; that is, none of them have *any* rational historical claim to truth; and all of them carry the distinct scent of retconning. 

And if we accept the opinion of most(all?) scholars that the Pure Land sutras weren't actually taught by the historical Buddha, we're in an even more awkward position of having to take on faith the words of an anonymous author who was lying about where he got his information.

So... what am I missing? Am I thinking about this the wrong way? 

I realize this comes across as an attack on your belief system, but I want to emphasize that I am actually *asking a question;* I know lots of Pure Land Buddhists are smart and educated, and I want to know how they justify their faith to themselves.",Buddhism,1666203604.0,t3_y8a32a,0.58,6

Anyways, something has been troubling me as of late. I believe that due to¬†me being reborn an infinite amount of times, one day I will experience extreme torture.

Think I may have experienced ego dissolution,"I‚Äôm an 18 year old female, and last night was very strange. It all started from a friend who i have been in love with for over a year, i have never told him how I felt, last night he said ‚ÄúI love you (platonically), this is nothing unusual, he says this occasionally and I tell him I love him too. But it hurt me at first, because I know he will never see me as something more. But this led to a confusing array of questions, i cant remember much from last night specifically, except I remember feeling bad and eventually calling out to something spiritually within the universe to guide me to gain a clearer answer. The next day I woke up expecting to feel completely normal as I usually do, but I didn‚Äôt. I haven‚Äôt felt like myself all day, and I was so cripplingly aware of who I‚Äôve been in my past, how my friendship with this person was just a mirror of my bad childhood that I was subconsciously seeking out, and I immediately felt no attachment to him anymore, I still love him as a friend and we‚Äôre still friends obviously, but it was like all that pressure and my behaviour and how it negatively manifested in my friendship with him had just gone. I couldn‚Äôt feel a connection to my past identity and still can‚Äôt really, like I woke up an entirely new person. I became aware that although introspection is a good thing, I have been almost unhealthily obsessed with it, which was actually bringing me more misunderstanding than understanding. I have been questioning everything; am/was I just a performance for everybody? Is this really me?. I thought I was experiencing some symptom of a mental disorder before I realised that this feeling feels strangely similar to an ego dissolution i experienced on psychedelics a couple of years ago, although nothing about me changed after I had come down from the drugs. So then I started to look into the Buddhist side of ego dissolution (I have only been Buddhist for a few months), and realised that I‚Äôm pretty sure this is what I‚Äôm feeling. I have been practicing yoga and occasional meditation for the past few months, I would do yoga anyway before I became Buddhist but I‚Äôve been doing it more frequently since I found myself aligning with Buddhist beliefs. I‚Äôve been listening to sound baths, burning incense and I have a few crystals too that I use in different scenarios. I just really didn‚Äôt expect to feel ego dissolution this quickly, although I am seeing it as my opportunity to live in the real world and do good with my actions. I almost don‚Äôt even want to think about who I was before, I just want to live. But my question is, what do i do now? Since feeling like this, I‚Äôve almost been in a vegetative state, de-motivated but also just trying to experience the feeling, do I just carry on with my life as normal but with this achieved awareness? What if I start to lose the awareness? Should I engage more in meditation and yoga? I meditated for 10 minutes after researching ego dissolution, and im going to have a bath soon and do yoga anyway.

I find most of them interesting intros to Buddhism but often too simplistic, imbibed with an optimism typical of the late 1980s-1990s , when it seemed that the , after the end of the Soviet Union and the silent demise of some right-wing dictatorships in Latin America, the world was going to be a peaceful and prosperous place ( AFAIK it has become far, far worse).  But if I read CHOGYAM TRUNGPA I find really an incredible depth in each page: call him a fascist, a drunkard, a cult-leader...but his speeches come out from a profund knowledge of both Buddhism and human psychology. Of course, trying to imitate his lifestyle would be foolish. However , I know that there  have been  some other Crazy Wisdom Masters in Buddhism like Ikkyu in Japan and certain Mahasiddhas in Tibet and India. Do you remember their names? Is here some direct disceple of Vajradhara? What do you think

Autism and Buddhism compatibility issues?,"I am constantly conflicted. Between the trauma received consistently from abelism, from invalidation, from psychiatric abuse.

The sensory issues. A limbic system that's dysfunctional, a frontal lobe dysfunction as a result of psychotropic damage and likely epigenetic toxin load.

Mind altering substances and asceticism,"THC is a mind altering substance, so I stopped consuming it.

Caffeine is a mind altering substance, so I stopped consuming it.

Now I am thinking, perhaps all substances are mind altering substances... if so should I stop consuming all substances? This would include food, which creates a natural motivation for fasting.

Even so, as a human being a need to live life with food is superimposed upon me physiologically. So is the task at hand to minimize the extent to which we rely on substances?

In the case of fasting, the mind enters a different state. It is natural to desire food in this state... is one to fast until this desire no longer exists? This makes me think that the function of asceticism is to realize one's relationship with the material world, such that we engage with it on our own terms or by necessity.

"Isn't belief in Samsara, rebirth and liberation a form of clinging in itself? Not a slander post just a discussion of this thought I have.","The flaw with this thought is that you need to assume that after death nothing actually happens and it's just pure nothingness (like it was before birth), which contradicts the whole Buddhist rethoric already.

But if we go through with that assumption and take this point of view, doesn't Samsara and rebirth just become another sort of clinging to this world? You refuse to accept that there's nothing and come up with a system that allows you to exist after death and before birth. You cling to this existence.

Not only that but Nirvana or liberation is then the idea that you can achieve some state of bliss free from worldly suffering while still existing to some extent. This is another form of clinging to existence with ""pleasure"" included, is it not?

Experiencing Oneness and getting extreme depression afterwards,"Hi


I recently, on 21st June, for celebrating 21st of june, took LSD. During my trip I felt like all souls, all existing living beings were just one and that the universe was just made out of ""vibrations"" at the end and that the universe originally was a big, uniform sound ; and that the fact people were different people was because there have been a misunderstanding at some point, some sort of problem that once repaired would unite all beings in one and in an endless sound.


I meditated upon that for like few minutes, it felt like hours, and while I was in unity it was actually extremely pleaseant to not-feel and not-be if it makes sense 

Then I got out of my room still having this feeling that the world was one and I was one with the world, I was about to eat and then I realized that now that the whole world was united I was lonely idk, also that there was nothing to do and it was depressing as hell ? I got extremely sad and bad for few days afterwards and I was afraid that what I experienced could have actually been true ; I've thought about that a lot and read today Buddhist beliefs especially those about non-self and non-being and unity of the universe


I kinda got traumatized by experiencing this oneness, maybe because usually one should take years of meditation to reach this end and I took a shortcut to it without any prior preparation (some truths can hurt the unprepared)


I feel like I need to talk about theological stuff with buddhists especially this oneness, like is it actually what buddhism teaches ? Is it actually what you guys believe is a truth in the universe ?

If yes, what actually pushes any of you to continue to do anything in life instead of just doing nothing ?

Would a monk eat a carrot?,"A carrot is the taproot, and harvesting it requires the plant's early death.  To be edible, carrots need to be harvested before they get too woody, which is before the plant's natural death.

Does eating a carrot go against the teaching of ""do not kill""? Are we only to eat those plant parts that are readily offered by the plant for the purpose of eating (and dispersing seeds) without killing it (e.g. apples), or that otherwise do not cause death (e.g. leaves)?

Edit:. Thanks for the clarification and for pointing to Jainism for this principle. Now I need to read about sentience. The research I'm familiar with shows that plants definitely know that they've gotten damaged, whether mortally or not. Or is that more a ""reaction"" than a conscious response?

Buddhism = Nihilism?,"Hello, I am really new to Buddhism and about to deep dive into this topic.

Thoughts on the paradox of spirituality in the modern era?,"I find it interesting how modern culture seems to be moving away from ethics in terms of spiritual development, yet at the same time we see a revival of spirituality within traditions like Buddhism. If we use the panchasila and the athasila, the five percepts and eight precepts to examine our culture we can see that things have been in decline over the past 200 years. This is not universal. At the level of society the standard has been raised. There are less discrimination, war and injustice. But on a more personal level it seems like people are not keeping basic moral guidelines like before. Drug use has become very common, sexual misconduct has become very common. In this age of the internet people stay constantly entertained in mostly unwholesome ways. There is sense indulgence on a completely new level in this stage of capitalism. I think there is no doubt that modernity have taken most of us away from spending our days doing wholesome things, and we are a lot more distracted. In short it is a lot harder to practice meditation and sense restraint now than at any period in history. There is so much temptation and so many things that are constantly competing for our attention.     
  

On the other hand we see that the striving for spiritual awaking has been revived over the past 200 years. Not just in Buddhism, but in other Dharma traditions and also new spiritual traditions. As far as I know in most Buddhist countries personal practice towards awakening was very niche up until the modern era. The concepts of lay people meditating was unheard of in the Theravada tradition, and the monks striving for awakening was far and few between. Today it is very different. In Theravada the forest traditions have become very popular where even the lay people strive for Nibbana. Pretty much the exact same pattern is found in the traditions of Buddhism and Vedanta too. I am guessing that this pattern can be seen in most spiritual traditions that strive for awakening. And let us not forget all the westerners flocking to these traditions even though they remain very inaccessible. It seems strange that as the world becomes more worldly (indulgent, distracted, less personal ethics), the spiritual becomes more spiritual (newfound interest in reaching supreme liberation). Just imagine a person living 500 years ago, farming, doing duties to the community, no mass media, no entertainment, food was not filled with addictive crap. Life was slow and simple. That situation is ideal for a lay person to reach awakening. Yet people did not strive for it as much as today. I wonder what is really going on?     


Could it have something to do with the dissolution of the community and late stage capitalism making work feel less meaningful that drive people towards spirituality? What are your thoughts on this?",Buddhism,1632762422.0,t3_pwlk10,0.44,0

The Daily Tejaniya : How To Deal With Trump,"    
    **YOGI:**
    A yogi asks, ‚ÄúI get enraged listening to Donald Trump
    for even a few moments. His incompetence, lies, and com-
    plete lack of ethics is causing many people needlessly to
    die. How can I deal with the rage I feel towards him?‚Äù 
    
    
    **SUT:**
    We know Donald Trump is not going to change.
    We can‚Äôt change him, but we can change the quality
    of our mind. When he comes on the TV or the Inter-
    net or wherever, just start watching your mind. Attend
    to your own mind, not to Trump. Get interested in
    how the mind is reacting, not in what Trump
    is saying or in the person of Trump.  

    We need to be very clear that it is not Trump
    but our own judgments and thoughts of rage that 
    are shattering our peace of mind. Rather than spend
    our precious moments of life on Trump, change the
    object of your awareness. Change it from thinking
    about Mr. Trump, to observing what‚Äôs happening
    in your mind, or watch your feelings so you
    don‚Äôt get pulled into the thoughts.

How can anyone believe in karma when all evidence contradicts it?,"The only way I could see anyone believing in karma is if it is fueled by hubris - that is, if believing in it boosts their ego. For instance, someone believes that the reason they are successful is because they are a good and virtuous person, therefore their karma is good and led to their success and that they deserve it; conversely, they would believe that people who are not successful are evil or spiteful, thus it is their bad karma that led them down that road and they deserve it.

We all know that is not how the world works, whether or not you are willing to admit it. Success and wealth are based purely on luck. Let‚Äôs take for an example, a good mathematician. People would make the argument that that person became so skilled because they studied hard, but that is secondary to the fact that they were LUCKY enough to be born with good genetics that predispose them to intelligence and grasping math. Probably had rich and loving parents too. Everything is about luck; if you are lucky in life, you get to have a great life, and be successful and happy. If you are unlucky, everyone looks down on you, makes fun of you, excluded you, and you struggle and suffer for your whole life. What‚Äôs more, to add insult to injury, people say it‚Äôs because of some moral failing on your part, or bad karma, or sin, or whatever other label they try to pin on you to justify to themselves why they are so great and why you are beneath them.

There are so many examples in life of people who are awful human beings yet they are rich and successful. Pretty much every wealthy person is conceited, manipulative, rude, callous, selfish, and smug. There is literally no benefit to the self to being a good, compassionate, and caring person. 

I‚Äôm sick of being a loser and a failure in life just because I wasn‚Äôt born lucky. Everything in life is luck. I‚Äôm sure there will be egotistical, arrogant, self serving jackasses on this sub who will lecture me and tell me why I‚Äôm wrong and why everything is my fault, or make glib remarks insulting me.

Summing up Buddhism in 10 lines.,"Most of you reading this are attached to a delusion based on four fundamental misperceptions:

1. Things in existence are inherently what they are. (Inherent nature)
2. This inherent nature is stable. (Stability)
3. Yourself is part of these things in existence. (Self in existence)
4. This attachment of yourself to existence can be ultimately satisfactory. (Satisfaction of self in existence)

Against these four fundamental errors, Buddhism posits four corrections, respectively:

1. Things in existence have no inherent nature. (Emptiness)
2. Everything in existence is unstable. (Instability)
3. Yourself are not part of anything which exists. (No-self)
4. Attachment of yourself to existence will never be satisfactory. (Unsatisfactoriness)


* * * * *

Now let's add bit of an explanation about Emptiness.

It's easy to understand, even at a rational level, that everything in existence is impermanent, subject to change, and eventually will atrophy to the point of unrecognizability.

Emptiness is a more fundamental insight. It disputes that anything is what it is, even when it seems to be. Emptiness cannot be formulated or taught conceptually, since among its far-reaching lessons is the invalidation of all concepts, and the refutation of any and all conceptual truth.

Here are a few pointers.

There are two conduits readily available to us Westerners to gain some insight into emptiness: dreams and art.

They are fundamentally the same thing.

Art is essentially an attack on the delusion of inherent nature of objects.

It is a vigorous effort to escape the tyranny of reality.

Dreams just ignore this tyrannical delusion altogether.

For a more accessible explanation:

Art fights the entrenched tyranny of mundane concepts. We all saw these objects, like apple, sunrise, the human body, a million times. They become strongly established in our minds as an undisputed stable truth that simply cannot be otherwise. This inherent stable nature is the fertile ground which sprouts attachment. It is the foundation that art aims to undermine and topple. In the most mundane terms, it aims to make you look at reality with a new, fresh perspective.

Also known as ""Beginner Mind"" in Zen.

More fundamentally, art seeks to dispute and undermine the established order of concepts.

An important realization to reach at this point is that there are no objects, only concepts. We have no direct contact with reality, only concepts thereof which we established by imposing symbolic name-and-form (nama-rupa) on chaotic sense impressions.

Now that we realize that all these things aren't objects, but concepts, we can see that both art and dreams annihilate them in the same ways:

They mash them together, cut them apart, break them down to little pieces, and switch or replace them with each other.

More systematically, there are 3 fundamental mechanisms to attack those tyrannical concepts:

1. Mash them together, combining multiple concepts into a unified one.
2. Separate and break them apart, sometimes into little pieces.
3. Displace them (switch or replace one with another).

These mechanisms can and often do work together. For example: breaking multiple concepts into pieces, then combining some of these pieces into a new unified concept.

The necessity to dispute order is why art can seem random. Being ""random"" - i.e. deviating from the established conceptual order - is in fact a necessary condition for any artistic expression.

For example, [here's a musical piece about Boston's Waste Management System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hsA6jxsGJU).

Traditional Buddhist techniques to help disciples realize Emptiness include meditation, koans, abrupt actions performed by the teacher to surprise and shake the student's mind away from its entrenched conceptual tracks, shouting, and beating.

You will notice that at least four of those are Zen techniques, and indeed Zen is quite focused on imparting the insight of Emptiness.",Buddhism,1549015003.0,t3_am0isa,0.44,0

"I believe that people who ""want to become Buddhist"" have an attachment to fashion (and cheap malas).","When I was younger, all my friends listened to a particular band. That genre of music was very different from the style of music that I naturally gravitated to, but because I was motivated to fit in, I ended up appreciating that music. 

The genre of music was country, and I, with sheer will and determination, liked country music and musicians like Confederate Railroad, Dwight Yoakam, Brad Paisley, etc. 

It then occurred to me, that a person can absolutely love anything, any genre of music, any school of architecture, any fashion trends, and can harbor any opinions just by dint of trying to fit in. 

For people ""wanting to become Buddhist,"" my advice to you is this: The same motivation that you have to learn the Dharma, I say use this energy to:

* empathize, understand, and be excited helping persecuted people in your own community - the ""nerds,"" the elderly, the unpopular kids at school, the undesirable person who sits by themselves at lunch, and the people who are shunned, etc. 

* ask yourself: Do I really know the cultural environment from which Buddhism sprang from and spent its formative years? DO you know anything about the cultural under-pinnings of Buddhism, or anything about religions that came from the same foundations? I'm sure a practicing Christian knows far more about the various tribes of Israel and even pre-Christians like the Samaritans, Hebrews, Judea Province, and King David, but the Buddhists don't know anything about Jainism or Sikhism.

"To my utter shock, ""In Myanmar, Buddhist Mob Group Kills Dozens of Muslims"". What can we do?","I post this to do my duty as a meditation practicing and Buddhist enthusiast but ignorant in the field of Buddhist religion as a social institution.

According to the news, [""a Buddhist mob rampaged through a town in an isolated corner of Myanmar, hacking Muslim women and children with knives""](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/16/mynanmar-buddhist-mob-kills-muslims_n_4610496.html?utm_hp_ref=religion&ir=Religion).

This piece of news hit me like lightning. I didn't know that Buddhism could nest such kind of behaviors. I knew that there are religious tensions in Asia between Buddhists and Muslims, but would've never thought that Buddhists could commit such abominable acts.

Whereas other fundamentalist religions bear hints of tolerating conflict in some circumstances in their scriptures, the Buddhist teachings are organically against any kind of violence. So what has happened in Myanmar is beyond my comprehension and an utter shock for me. I have been dreaming that Buddhism is an oasis of peace and tolerance and now I don't know anymore.

So what could be done about this abomination? That mob should be let know that they are not Buddhist at all. They should know this, they should know that their next attacks will be committed solely under their own name - not as Buddhists. Dalai Lama should take a powerful stance on this. This should never happen again, ever, under the cover of Buddhism. I hate to find out that I had been deluding myself into thinking that I've finally found a clean spiritual path, whereas I will have walked on it along murderers and monsters.

Of course, there is this ridiculous argument: ""People will do atrocities in the name of any religion. There is nothing to be done about this"". Yes, it is! They must know from the highest Buddhist figures that they and their ideas and deeds disqualify them to call themselves Buddhists. Even if excommunication is not possible, they must at least know that according to Buddhist ideas, they are anything else but followers of Gautama teachings.

Christianity vs. Buddhism,"I was raised a in a devout Christian family. I rejected the religion at a very early age, however my mother still clings to it and most of our family friends remain Christians as well. Throughout most of my life these family friends  have been nothing short of judgmental and neurotic all in the name of Christianity (which seems to be against everything that Christ taught), and this is partially what drove me away from the religion. Most Buddhists or those studying eastern philosophies, however, have been (from my perspective) extraordinarily kindhearted and compassionate individuals, free from many of the bad tendencies that many of our Christian friends had.
In addition, my father was a Christian throughout most of his life, however about 5 or so years ago he made a quiet transition from Christianity to Buddhism. Before that, he and my mother constantly fought and he was in a bad mood a lot of the time. Since ""converting"" (he attends church only when my mother requires it) it is almost like a new person was created entirely; every bad habit or tendency he had before has completely vanished and he has recently become a vegetarian as well.

In essence, I was wondering what were some of your thoughts pertaining to why it seems that Buddhism is succeeding where Christianity is failing. I have observed this time and time again, in which the actions of Buddhists differ greatly from the actions of Christians, while many of Christ's teachings seem to be in line with Buddhist thought.

Animals live in the realm of being food for other animals. only humans (most, at least, some adventurers obviously do not share that fate) are excluded from that. and the point behind buddhism is not to make some kind of paradise on earth; such a thing could never happen. the point is to get rid of the ideas and concepts of life and death itself. only then can you actually be free.

Can some of our Theravada members consider being a little less... transparently sectarian when people ask for advice on beginning with Buddhism?,"I feel like there's a divide between what people recommend to new people asking for general information, where most posters link to fairly broad non-sectarian resources, and some posters from Theravada traditions exclusively link to Theravada resources. I understand that the relationship between Theravada and Mahayana historically hasn't been the most sectarianism-free, but it's starting to be consistent enough that it feels somewhat like bad faith sectarianism.

I'm a Tibetan Buddhist, and you can find recent posts in my post history agreeing that the Dhammapada is not a bad starting point for a very broad overview of Buddhism. I have little issue directing people towards resources that are heavy on Theravada material because I'd rather people practice the Dharma than not, and if Theravada practices work for them then that's commendable, but it's beginning to leave a bit of a bad taste in my mouth, personally. I don't know if I'm alone in this perspective, and if so I'll take the L and move on with my day, but I'd really like to see a more concerted effort at non-denominational advice when people come seeking new things.

This *especially* goes for presenting Theravada historiography as inherently true; both teachings have equal (historical) claim to originality. While I understand the Theravadin perspective differs on this, the subtle implication of the illegitimacy of Mahayana does show up in many of these posts. We can be better, and we can be less sectarian.

>I see a common misconception in the comments. The problem is not with quoting suttas - or Theravada authorities like Buddhaghosha - but with claiming that these are the only original texts of Buddhism.

"Finally realized why people go to parties with loud music, dancing, drinking, and drugs.","It's an untrained, unskillful method to stop thought.

...the voice in your head is finally drowned out!

Your thoughts, anxieties, insecurities, obsessions, fears, rational concepts of reality - all overwhelmed and driven away. For a while.

Non-Violence taken to an extreme seems like a luxury and a cop-out,"I‚Äôm sorry, but there are children being sold into sex slavery every day. If Buddhism teaches non-violence to the extreme of not cracking down on perps of these sorts of demented things, where is the logic? How is it righteous to only be open to acts of gentle service, but be against the ferocity required when defending the innocent from tyranny?
This is not to say violence should be used as a first resort, but there are many situations in which defense is necessary, especially through the lens of seeing how it effects those unable to defend themselves. Most Buddhists I have met are single, have no children, do not have a connection to society other than acts of service, which is helpful and good, but does not encompass all of the ways humans find themselves interacting on this earth. If I had had the chance to kill Jeffrey Epstein, I would have done it. It‚Äôd be great if he would have healed, but if I had had the opportunity to end his time here, I would have done it for the sake of his victims.

Buddhist Interpretation of Pok√©mon Cosmology,"In the Pok√©mon franchise, several things seem to be true that seem to draw an analogy to Buddhist teachings.

In Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl, the main antagonist's goal is to escape suffering and he identifies 'Spirit' or 'Heart' as the main culprit. He believes the human spirit is flawed and would prefer to live in a world that is devoid of spirits. Through various means, he tries to forcefully create a new world that was 'pure' and without spirit.

When I came across a basic explanation of Pure Land buddhism, I was reminded of this plot, so I explored it a bit more.

Buddhism assumes no Creator, but in various teachings that are passed down, it is also said that, rather than creating themselves and then the planes, deities descend to planes of existence at their creation (for as far as the concept of a beginning and end applies) to shape it. In the pok√©mon franchise, Arceus appears to be fulfilling a similar role, descending from another plane and then using emanations of himself to order it. The pok√©mon world has always been the world of kami from Shinto religion, but this makes me wonder if perhaps it is also meant emulate pure land.

The pok√©mon franchise also makes clear that this is but one in a massive web of world, which reminded me of the Net of Indra. Which in turn reminded me that, in the pok√©mon world, that 'net' may be more literal than simply an analogy to explain the interpenetration of the dharma. Residents in the pok√©mon world do not question that they can exchange pok√©mon with residents of other realities.",Buddhism,1636377490.0,t3_qpdgax,0.56,2
