Possible Cancer Diagnosis - How would stoics approach this?,"Hey all,

So recently I found a palpable lump in my chest just below my collarbone, and every day I feel some pain radiating from it.

I went to the doctor the other day, hoping that it would just be my hypochondria and to be sent off fine, but the doc confirmed that there is a lump there, and they took blood to find out if it is ""an accumulation of cells"", whether that be benign or malignant and so on.

I haven't got the blood test results back yet, and I have been emotionally very all over the place, going from feeling fine, to straight up crying for hours. To be honest, I am a bit scared.

I was wondering if anyone here knows how the stoics would approach such a situation, and if they could share some of that wisdom.

How to Stop Caring What Others think of you," `as long as you produce something of value other's opinion doesn't matter.`  

In order to stop caring what others think of you, You need to understand the root cause of this behavior and **why we do it** 

According to psychology, Our childhood experiences have a big impact on how much we care about what others think of us. If we were criticized, neglected, or abused, we are more likely to have low self-esteem and be more sensitive to the judgments of others.

Interestingly, studies show that children as young as two years old are already aware that they‚Äôre being evaluated by others, and they will adjust their behavior to seek a positive response.

This need for social acceptance and fear of rejection is still present in adulthood because social media has become another common approach to seek approval. where many of us consider social media personas as an extension of your self worth, even though your value as a person hasn‚Äôt changed.

So we cant just delete this human nature out of our system so **what can you do about it?**

 The first step is to build a strong mindset by **Expecting and accepting that people will always have opinions of you,** the truth is There‚Äôs no use in trying to avoid any judgment because it‚Äôs simply impossible. And when you expect that people will always have opinions, you become more resilient to criticism.

Another thing to keep in mind is when you are in social situations, STOP TRYING TO READ Other‚Äôs MINDs, Those who care about others‚Äô opinions often believe they‚Äôre being noticed more than they really are,  which is a psychological phenomenon knows as ‚Äú**The spotlight effect**‚Äù 

But in reality we are all in a midst of our personal accomplishments and humiliating situations that most of us usually focus on what is happening to us as well as how other people see it. 

After reading research studies and articles I made an animated [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7ofWl5DkI) to illustrate this topic, explaining  how our childhood experiences have a big impact on how much we care about what others think of us . If you prefer reading. I have included important reference links below.

cheers!

What drugs was Marcus Aurelius taking?,"Galen, his physician, says that Marcus Aurelius took a traditional remedy called *theriac*, which contained ""a grain"" of opium. We don't know what precise quantity this denotes, unfortunately, but Galen seems to be implying that it was a small amount.  Marcus complained that it was making him drowsy, so Galen reduced the dose further.  Some people have speculated that he was an addict.  I don't think the evidence supports that conclusion as use in very small doses, from what I gather, wouldn't necessarily lead to addiction, and the fact that Marcus requested a *reduction* in the does perhaps also speaks against it.

What's less well-known, perhaps, is that we're told several times in the Roman histories that when Marcus finally visited Athens he was initiated into the mysteries at nearby Eleusis, in a ceremony which entailed drinking a potion known as the *kykeon.*  In his bestseller, *The Immortality Key: The Secret History of the Religion with No Name*, Brian C. Muraresku collects evidence that suggests the *kykeon* contained ergot, cultivated for its hallucinogenic properties.  Marcus' trip to Eleusis seems to have been an important public event but it happened in 176 CE, which was probably after he'd finished writing the *Meditations*.

Incidentally, a bust of a Roman emperor, believed to be Marcus, was placed over the main gate of the Temple of Demeter at Eleusis.  It still exists there today ([photo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Cuirassed_bust_of_Marcus_Aurelius%2C_Eleusis_%2813945732075%29.jpg)).

Dealing with my Breakup,"I have mostly been a person detached emotionally to concepts of relationship or having a girlfriend because of my first breakup . Anyway I had a friend for an year or so and eventually we both developed liking towards each other . And as days passed I realized I was deeply in love with her . Because of that I often ignored how she used to slide her toxicity ( she literally tried to convince me to against my family) , spoke shit about my father , and even when I tried to communicate my problems , she used to put the blame on me and use tears as her weapon against me . There was a guy in our lives who basically was fellow classmate . he tried to talk to her and they started sharing reels and stuff , I was unbothered by it . But as she was my girlfriend he labelled her a slut infont of our peers for talking to her . for which I literally had a fight with him threaten him and they stopped talking. Before our breakup my girlfriend told me that because I wasn't talking to her for awhile she started talking with him again.

Enchiridion 21,"‚Äú21. Let death and exile, and all other things which appear terrible be daily before your eyes, but chiefly death, and you will never entertain any abject thought, nor too eagerly covet anything.‚Äù 
Enchiridion 21,  Epictetus. 

My own interpretation is the following:  
""It's hard to be a good person when no one is watching. But know that posterity always watches. When you understand that your body and belongings will be returned at some point, and together with your actions(the result of your thoughts) will be judged by posterity. Then you will always be motivated to do the right thing.""

I am trying to understand the psychological mechanisms behind why visualising death will motivate me to not to think ‚Äúabject thoughts‚Äù and ‚Äútoo eagerly covet anything‚Äù

I've been (is) worried about the state of the world - was told about Stoicism,"Hello. I have been doomscrolling throughout the internet. I've been keep reading bad news all over the world ever since europe warns citizens from Russia.

I have a problem with not knowing everything and I cannot accept it (right now).

I'm a father, kid is 1 years old, I love him to death. I wish nothing bad to ever happen to him (like every parent I hope). After all this war related stuff, i've been very depressed and I fear for the future.

I've been reading about Russia/Ukraine, NATO/Russia, North Korea threats, Iran building nukes, Israel/Gaza war, China/Taiwan. To a point where I just couldn't handle all the information and just broke.

&#x200B;

So i've come here, hoping to learn from you guys. I don't know much about stoicism but I read this simple definition of the term ""In simple terms, Stoicism **teaches us to focus on the things we can control‚Äîour thoughts, emotions, and actions‚Äîwhile accepting the things we cannot**, such as the actions of others or the natural course of events going on in the world around us.""

This is probably just what I need to learn in my life, but I don't know how to accept that this is what I need to do.

Thanks for reading.

Hardest time in my relationship,"Hi guys, I 23M currently at my toughest point of my relationship with my gf 23F. She is currently thinking about the state of our relationship and where it is heading. Im afraid that we might be breaking up. I really love her a lot, its been really hard for me but thanks to this situation, I have connected more to the stoic teachings, especially Marcus Aeurilius. 

It inspired me to create this:

""An animal decays upon death, rocks seemingly eternal withers against time. Even trees who stand straight bows down eventually. What about the mind and soul? Pests and roots cannot reach it, as it is independent of the physical world. Time does not weaken or strengthen it, only philosophy and commitment to the divine self can.

Turning to you guys for help. Lost faith in life.,"Stoicism has helped me through many of my tough times but I‚Äôm out of it now, I‚Äôve slipped into depression. 

This is why: I‚Äôm from a fairly lowly background and I dedicated my life to a career.  The idea was I would prove my worth by becoming successful through grit.  

Over the last few years:

One of my friends from a well-connected family got an offer from a friend - a connection.  He spent a lot of his life living like a playboy and now he‚Äôs leapfrogged me in career due to the network he has that I don‚Äôt. 

My other friend who didn‚Äôt graft like me is set in inherit money I would never dream of. 

My brother, who has spent a lot of his life avoiding hard work, has pushed a pretty weak medical negligence claim but will win more money than I‚Äôll ever have and retire from it.  

My parents inherited all the family money and left nothing for us, spent it all on drugs and alcohol and on my brother.  

Now I am trapped working long hours in a hard career and I have less than all these people.  As I have to work hard my daughter is having issues in school.

The link between what I do and what I get is broken.  I‚Äôve ended up with less than everyone but I did everything right.

I‚Äôm losing faith in life, everything.  I want to give up, it keeps happening. Everyone I know is ending up wealthy through fate and I‚Äôm stuck still with a mortgage, long hours etc. 

What was it all for?  I can‚Äôt stop as we will be impoverished.   Why did fate choose me to be the worker?  The other hilarious point is my earnings are taxed heavily but all their inheritance and claim is tax free, so I‚Äôm having to pay their taxes too. 

I know these are externals etc but I got to wake up at 5 every day and have health problems.  I got to have less time with kids. It‚Äôs not money, it‚Äôs my quality of life. 

I don‚Äôt have to be super rich and I don‚Äôt mind others good fortune but I feel like I‚Äôve been conned.  It‚Äôs all mainly luck and God and fate seems to want to rub my nose in it.  It‚Äôs a good job I have kids otherwise after this happening so often I would want to check out of this corrupt and unfair world",Stoicism,1705813830.0,t3_19bvqaf,0.57,1
I know what i need to do i just dont know what to do about it. I base my self worth on external factors and its making me miserable.. like not having friends makes me feel worthless.

Makes me feel like i have nothing interesting or worthwhile or useful to say. 

Most times i try to say something like this i get left on seen or in real life people say reply with one words. 

What do i need to do? Read? Meditate? Find a hobby? Follow my interests? Learn more about conversations and talking? Set boundaries? Do things that make me happy? Set a specific goal and achieve it? I have many problems but im trying not to overwhelm my self and just focus on one thing at a time.

Years later,"Hi All, 28F looking for some advice here..

I grew up in a small town with a tight group of friends from elementary school through high school. Growing up, we were attached and all thought we‚Äôd be friends for the rest of our lives, in each others weddings etc. When we went off to college, we each went our separate ways, got jobs in different cities but stayed in contact thru social media, keeping each other up to date in a group message. At the time, I had gotten into a new relationship which eventually became toxic. I had made some new friends where I was studying/working and they knew about what was going on and what I was dealing with but I was so reluctant to tell my hometown friends about what I was going through.. I remember feeling embarrassed by the situation I was in. They all seemed happy and successful and I didn‚Äôt know how to communicate it. 3-4 months go by, (maybe more, I can‚Äôt remember exactly) where I don‚Äôt respond or update my life in this group message. One day I sign on and see that one of the girls removed me from the group. I remember a ton of emotions and at that time (6-7 years ago) I was still young and spite got over me, so I deleted all of my socia accounts which of course was wrong in hindsight. The first few months I felt pissed/angry and then as time went on, I felt an immense amount of guilt for never addressing it properly.  I‚Äôm at a point in my life where I know that we all moved on and that‚Äôs life, to accept it and I don‚Äôt feel as guilty as I did, considering no one reached out to me during one of the hardest times of my life to see how I was doing.

My feeling when I am unhappy in general,"Hello, dear friends! ‚ù§Ô∏è

I have very difficult situation..
I am unhappy now .. in everything..
I am confused und very tired emotionally in soul. 

A lot of different situations create responsibilities for me which I must to do. It is not fantasy, it is from reality. 
As example, to study German language every day from 7:30 - 16:30 on classic school in 14 faculties and after study it in integration course 17:00-19:15 Monday - Thursday.
After I have to do a lot of tests and exams in Bio/Chemie/History/German Literature/Ethik/Art/Informatik/Math/another subjects in school for grades minimum 4 - maximum 1-2. And I have to do general exam in B1 German from integration course in March.
And in Juni I have to do Exam from German History for integration.

In another side, I have to do a volunteer project in school because it is special  important program for to get grades for all students in 9 classes from 3 faculties - GRW, Deutsch, Ethik. It is a main responsibility inside school for everyone in 9 class.

And also I have to do a lot of homeworks in 14 faculties of school and in integration course. 

I have to go to doctors also at this time when I must to be in the lessons.

I have to send all documents for Jobcenter because of Baf√∂g (Baf√∂g is smaller for me then Burgergeld which I got earlier. I can not to pay for my flat by this money, and for food it is also not anough per month). I have to write in Email a lot about it for Jobcenter. I am tired also of it.

I have to have good grades in study. When grades will badly in study faculties or in exam of integration German, - in faculties I have to repeat 9 class once more, and in integration corse I have to pay new course to repeat last level of German language because it is new law which government of Germant created for Ukrainians in January 2024. It is a biggest stress.

In result...

I love in my heart English, study in English, work in profession in English (as a UI/UX Designer - 5 years, Front-End developer - 7 years). 
I love to paint illustrations in study materials also.
I love a lot to be as a mentor in developing software (have 2 years experience in this area).
But...
I can not to do it in Germany.. because they from government wanted from me to study German language and go to work which they want (not a developer, not a designer/illustrator). For designer/illustrator/developer in requirements for work in companies they need a lot of ""Ausbildung in Graphik/Kunst/Digital"" , ""B2 Deutsch"", ""Akademische Ausbildung"".
When I see it, I feel myself unhappy. 

I am cry today a lot when I opened German language book of integration because I have to do a lot of Homeworks of study it, and I really hate it now(o Got, I said it.. hope, the Germans will not hate me of this). 

Why I have to do things and processes in Germany which I don't like/hate/because another institutions want it?

I feel happy when I paint illustrations of study books/materials, when I teach development for somebody and believe in this person, when I see how my student goes to get win in study process and how he gets it with happy in his face, when I can develop software by myself, when I can do researchment and read / collect special data of research for create some functions in software.. 

But.. I can not to do it in Germany.. 
I have education in internet from Ukraine, not from Ausbildung in Deutschland.. it is not enough here for work and study, and study German language for my mind is more difficult as English.

I really love English with all my heart.. I also would like to teach English for German people as a teacher.. but this needs Uni/Studium of Teaching and special license of teaching (only according German standards of teaching)

When I understand this, I am cry once more..
I am confused.. 

What do you think, what will do in my place Aristoteles or Mark Aurelius?/or Kannt/ or Nicshe?

I am very grateful for your help..

I want advice that I can use in the moment. Not just platitudes to repeat.,"I get nervous around people. Socially anxious. I know that I don't want to give my thoughts and time over to what I think others think of me (ofcourse, unless it is something that is right) because I know that it is not a good use of time.

Advice like ""life is too short for this"" and ""They don't think about you"", or ""You can't control their thoughts"", or ""It's all in your head"", are kind of useless when my reaction is automatic and my thoughts are buried in my subconsciousness.

I need some advice that I can try daily to combat my subconscious thoughts, and also in the moment. I need something that can change that automatic reaction.

Though I am aware of these thoughts in the moment, and even talk to myself in my head to reason with myself right at that moment I realise I am having these thoughts, I can't control the ""stiffness"" I feel when I feel as if they're staring at me, or judging me.

My biggest life mistake was wanting to live an easy life,"2023 summons this the best, I didn‚Äôt want to exercise, diet, barely studied, barely did anything useful, expected my friend to do all the work for me, procrastinated a lot by saying that ‚Äútomorrow I start to do this‚Äù, got addicted to porn, tried to be a people pleaser (even going against some of my own believes), etc 

I regressed a lot as a person and what  were my rewards for wanting to live an easy life basically in autopilot with no logic and following just pure emotions ? Anxiety, memory issues, suicidal thoughts, weight gain, burnout, a lot of extra final exams that almost cost me a full semester, almost lost some of my friendships, i got way behind my peers and didn‚Äôt get my driver‚Äôs license 

Growing up I was never pushed/expected to do great things, if I was average that was enough for my parents and me, my mom basically did my homework for me, I would eat and watch tv all day and not leave the apartment and no one would care, so I never developed discipline, sense of urgency and maturity 

I have my ups and downs but basically to this day I lack those core elements and the 4 stoic principles 

With no temperance no self discipline nor control so I will waste my days with pleasurable things and just ‚Äúdo the important things tomorrow‚Äù, even tho nothing guarantees me a tomorrow

With no wisdom no intelligence and resourcefulness making me have bad grades at my college and be afraid to treat patients (I‚Äôm learning to be a dentist but I don‚Äôt reread core concepts such as anesthesia so I just ask my friend to do all the work for me at the clinic)

With no courage no scape from my comfort zone so I don‚Äôt try to improve myself
