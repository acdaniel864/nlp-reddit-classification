I failed to be Stoic in a argument with my mother,"Hello, I’m new to Stoicism and tonight I had a argument with my mother and I lost my cool and got angry and aggressive, I want to know how I can keep my cool in an argument again and to be more successfully Stoic and to keep control of my emotions.

Stoicism allowed me to put my ego asidw and handle situations/ opinions better,"Last year I made a psychological evaluation and one of the results was “difficulty controlling the ego” and ironically enough I didn’t accepted that, but it was right I always took things personally and if anyone else disagreed with me I would get upset and try to use random arguments and play the role of the victim 

But nowadays I understand that I’m a flawed person who’s not the responsible for anyone’s actions and reason aside from mine own, nowadays if someone disagree with me I try to understand why and if I’m wrong and if I am how to fix that 

Yeah I know very basic stuff but it’s good to know that I’m improving and accepting that I’m just a guy",Stoicism,1705188858.0,t3_1961hoj,0.5,0
Stoic wisdom,"I am fairly new to stoicism (seriously studying for 6 months). I have learned many lessons from Marcus Aurelius and try to incorporate them in my life.

I have learned to understand my emotions and not react to them without understanding. I have learned to embrace suffering and learn from it, but I am struggling with this trial.

My wife has stage 4 breast cancer and I work away from home for 14 days at a time. She has fallen ill and my parents are caring for her (something like a bad flu). She has an MRI coming soon and she is worried that it has moved to her brain. I cannot relinquish the fear of the future and it is effecting my ability to live in the present. If this is part of the logos and I shouldn't fight the current of fate, then how do I be okay with what is to come, so that I can continue to love her with the time we are alotted. 

Even Marcus wept over the loss of a beloved teacher. He lost his wife and 12 of his children. How can I come to grips with it like he did?",Stoicism,1705188334.0,t3_1961ayf,0.57,1
What are the virtues of a wise man? What are qualities you admire in someone?,"I recently read How to Think Like a Roman Emperor: The Stoic Philosophy of Marcus Aurelius by Donald Robertson: he said that it is an insightful and useful exercise to think and write down what virtues/qualities you admire in someone so that you can align yourself with those virtues—the exercise influenced by Marcus in Book 1 of Meditations.

Subsequently, I am now in the process of looking into what qualities I see in a wise man. Drop any ideas and qualities you admire in the comments. I would be interested to see what people have in mind.

It's a great read if anyone wants a practical book to practise stoicism while following the story of Marcus Aurelius.",Stoicism,1705178358.0,t3_195xkv8,0.9,20

How to develop a stronger mindset ?,"I feel like I’m a very influenciable and impressionable person and this is obviously a very negative and dangerous thing to have, fortunately I’ve not been scammed by anyone but I definitely keep rethinking my principles all the time, like if i see a cool person in real life or even a fictional one I’m like “I need to be like them” 

And im tired of that, one thing is to wanting to improve and being inspired by someone else but other thing is to be basically devoted to them and replace your personality to theirs, I don’t want to be weak and waste my time anymore

I dont do this anymore but i used to text a girl and try to prove to my self that im not unlikeable or loveable and always would backfire.

And i dont even know what to talk about, be interested in her? I become interested but they arent interested, because i always text first, I dont know how to have conversations for a long time... or talk about everything, i suck at talking

"How can I keep out all desires out of my mind, when its also my duty to push myself to work hard enough to provide for my family","I am always in a twist and turn between two career, one is high risk, high rewards, another is low risk, good rewards but with hell lot of hardwork. I always wanted to try the first one, but the duty that I can fail my family completely always has kept me at bay, it was didn't felt ""stoic"" to puruse just because of the passion, so I decided that I will cut off all my liesure time and give to both, 1st & 2nd career (hidden from fam)

Rather than commiting to one ""career"" choice, I have commited to a routine and detached myself from the results of either outcome, I always felt, trying to catch 2 rabbits, won't get me either, but not thinking about the result (which ain't in my control) and keeping my focus in the moment & the process will do me good. but anxiety hits me when my family asks me when is my career taking off. 

Since I always try not to never think about the milestone or result, and rather than focus on everyday, the thoughts of ""pursuing"" or even doing two things in a day, which would seem normal to anyone, takes a big toll on my reasonsing as to where am I headed? Am i being selfish not commiting to one thing that do my family good and excel in it. (doing my duty rather than running for small passions) or am I wrong to puruse a thing in the act of desiring it for my family (which evidently does affect my peace & can be attested 98% by the world, because they are or have been in the same boat) should I just perform my one duty without the care reaching my desire & focus on my sole virute ",Stoicism,1705158097.0,t3_195pumv,0.63,2
What is the view of depression in stoicism,"I was introduced to stoicism by this greek doctor that I worked with two years ago and suffice to say some of the principles had helped me through some dark times in my life. 

I am curious to see the perspective of a stoic in terms of depression. I constantly get a sudden attack of extreme sadness with or without trigger which manifests in physical tiredness (too tired to move even a little) 

I think the scary thing about depression is how real you think what lies/uncertainty/assumption/conclusion your mind tells you. 

Like many others struggling the same, I get tired too, tried many things but to no avail. 

I have accepted that there is no guarantee that I will get better and vice versa. 

Do I just accept that my life is surrounded by mostly sadness?  And how do I achieve that?",Stoicism,1705157618.0,t3_195poga,0.6,3
Do stoics dedicate 100% of themselves to do a task ?,"I’ve heard someone say that stoics strive to do more than needed, but I don’t remember it in Meditations (well I haven’t finished it yet), I procrastinate a lot so having some incentive and discipline would be nice",Stoicism,1705148455.0,t3_195mtmv,0.88,6

I saw a post here a short while ago about how Marcus Aurelius fed people to animals, and what that says about the credibility of his Meditations.  I don't know what the exact context was of my post title when he wrote it, but as I reflect on it, I am taking everything I have written here into consideration. 

Also, I try to praise loudly and criticize quietly, but I Still critize, blame people when I don't get what i want from them, especially if they've been reliable in the past. It's the inconsistency of people that gets to me alittle, because even though I am not perfect in my interactions with people, I prioritize being consistent(although it's out of my hands how people perceive my consistency.) So whenever i catch myself mentally blaming someone, I lean into it, but I ""level"" myself by adding to that mentally placating the person, or adding to that the mental equivalent of being physiologically distracted. Non of these is exactly in Stoicism(because non of those involves being super logical), but they are in a form of therapy I've found useful. And yes, I do know how important being logical about everything is, how useful logic is, and how indispensable it is to the life I am trying to live.

My Dad died on Tuesday morning this week. Slipped and Fell in the shower, buried him on Thursday. I suppose for some reason this post is one of the ways I am processing the loss.",Stoicism,1705126094.0,t3_195h9ls,0.95,16

Stoicism and Loneliness,"I had grown up with a group of friends that would always abuse me both verbally and physically and it would always torment me. However me being afraid of being lonely, I never decided to leave them until 8 years have passed and I have already been suffering too much.

I became pretty lonely but more at peace, yet I longed for companionship. I decided to have higher standards for friends and then I did meet new friends who were caring and loving but they always drift away from me. No one really stays.

I think that its so hard to surround myself with people who are nice because its hard to find that now a days and I hate being left out.

 I know this is not within my control and I should not care for outside factors but why does it hurt me? I keep telling myself, people who hurt me should not affect me because they arent worth time being sad about, but how do I have friends if I cant even be vulnerable around them as stoics teach us to not have attachments?",Stoicism,1705123015.0,t3_195gdj9,0.9,26
"""What should be done?"" My thoughts on this","Since I was little I've always been very inspired by history, and I've always wanted to 'make a difference', I guess is a good way of putting it. In short, I wanted to no longer be an NPC in the world, and today I see that things are a little more complicated, I think today I understand that this is something that we all try to do, and that perhaps this is what makes us part of the whole , we all want to be different and that's something that makes us equal, I think. Anyway, I always had this desire to find something that would make me do something for the world, not caring about fame or anything like that, but just to know that I contributed a little to the future of humanity, something like Newton's contributions to Physics, a subject that I have always loved. A little because of this, I decided to start a physics course at university, with the childhood dream that it would be easy to achieve something of this magnitude, but then I was faced with the fact that maybe I didn't like physics that much to dedicate myself to it. an entire life. I mean, the more time passes, the more I realize that I'm not an academic. I love physics, but I also love many other things that take up my time and that I consider just as important. It's as if the side of me that wants to do something for the world conflicts with the side of me that just seeks my happiness. On the one hand, I fear spending my whole life searching in vain, and in the end realizing that I wasted my chances of enjoying everything I could. And on the other side, I fear reaching the end of my life, taking advantage of every opportunity to be happy, but having to carry the burden of feeling like I haven't achieved anything, of not having left anything useful behind, as if my existence as a human asked me to do something. Currently the answer I have to this dilemma is that, no one who really changed the world had the objective of 'changing the world', they had an insatiable passion for something, and leaving a legacy of that was just a consequence of that passion. It's like an eternal doubt, I want to fulfill a duty and not be selfish, at the same time that I can't say there is something, a passion, that makes me focus on it that much, because I love many things.

&#x200B;

Forgive me for this huge text hehe. I know I'm still young and immature, so forgive me too if I wrote something clearly absurd (Also if this has nothing to do with stoicism, I'm still new), but that's how I feel. These existential questions have always plagued me, but I like to think, I like to think about them and any work that delves into this type of thing. A work that I can use to draw a parallel about how I feel is the work of fiction and fantasy Fate Stay Night, more specifically the character Emiya Shirou. In short, and spoilers ahead, the game has 3 routes in which Shirou makes different decisions. In one of them, he decides to become a hero of justice, even though he knows all the bitterness that this path would bring, and the story really deals with that, it is a complete break with that hero stereotype, but Shirou still chooses to be, which I think it's very pretty. In another route, however, he decides to be the hero of just one person, Sakura, the girl he loves. In one route he decides to embrace his childish ideals in the name of a greater good, and in another he decides to embrace his own happiness. In both cases he decides to embrace this passion, and I feel exactly in the middle of it, remembering that it is just a parallel. Trying to be a 'normal' person or trying to be something more. I see possible regrets in both of them. I know there's no right answer, but I think I wanted to vent a little about this, and I wanted to know if you guys had any thoughts on this. It's something that scares me a little hehe, but I like to think about it",Stoicism,1705115413.0,t3_195dz3r,0.43,0
How Do I transcend My Own Suffering?,"I recently started reading a psychiatry book, titled The Haunted Self, which is primarily focus on trauma diagnosis and recovery. I learned that trauma can shatter your very essence in a proportional amount to the severity and frequency of the trauma. Don't get me wrong I understand that suffering is a fact of life, and therefore, cannot be avoided. Additionally, suffering can teach us valuable lessons and propel us forward if harnessed and put to good use. Nevertheless, I still can't wrap my head around the fact that there are no lessons to learn from, for instance, having a family full of psychopaths, murderers, rapists and pedophiles. From the stoic point of view, how am I supposed to transcend pain when it was inflicted for sadistic pleasure repeatedly for a decade of my so-called childhood? How can I transcend the pain of never knowing what mother love is? How can I transcend the pain of losing everyone I care about?

I like the notion in Stoicism that moral virtue should be at the top of everyone's priorities. In fact, I lost everything and nearly lost my life because virtue matters the most to me, and if I get a re-do I won't change a thing. I guess my problem is that I don't understand how to resolve 'pointless pain' that offers no lessons, but still haunts me to this day.

Any advice would be appreciated.",Stoicism,1705094748.0,t3_1956aaq,0.78,5
Feeling the weight of time: Struggling to find my path in mid20s,"




I didn't work the entire 2023 year and I don't even have any health insurance. The only thing I did was trying to complete classes for college. But I even missed two semesters because of personal problems and stuff. I'm also feeling lost in life despite being in mid-20s. I just can't seem to find my path in life like career wise. I feel like I'm too old for college especially going in university because it seems like time consuming and finically expensive. I'm currently in community college and they do offer various certification programs and even two year degree programs but I'm not not sure what to get into as Im worrying like stuff about Ai expanding then bunch of layoffs happened. I want to get in a career that will help in long run and be substantial. I'm just stuck in this rut for about a year and even this new year hasn't been to a great start. I just can't afford myself sitting at home doing nothing. I'm just allowing my mind and thoughts control me. I'm tired of this anxiety and fear. Not having understand of life makes me feel weak and overwhelmed. I'm lacking confidence I guess and I'm just trying to find my way out. I previously so far only have fast food and retail experience but because I'm not driving, I'm kinda in a tight spot like transportation is issue in my area so I even applied to remote jobs but obviously I have hard time finding too sighs. So I'm just in completely messed up spot in life right now. Don't understand what to pick and choose or what to do first or something. I even worry like the world is changing so fast and it's important to learn essential life skills like doing your taxes, understanding how the economy works and the direction it's going.

Struggling to connect with others - feel like I am repeating the same thing over and over again.,"Life seems to be a constant struggle. I feel like I am running around in circles, infinitely so. 

I have struggled with depression for a long time (and I also have Aspergers). My depression is kind of situational. If I have friends, work and things to do, it doesn’t emerge. But when I don’t, life doesn’t feel worth living. I take mediciation for it (and therapy) which has helped immensely, but I can’t help but think that I seem to be stuck in this cycle that I cannot seem to break out of. 

My depression led to me dropping out of high school. Despite this, I worked my ass off at home and made it to one of the best colleges in the country.

While I find it easy to make 1:1 connections with others,  I never seem to connect with groups or make a solid circle of friends. The 1:1 friendships I have are often really intense but for one reason or another they die out. And for really inexplicable reasons. Sometimes they will go back home, then when college starts they suddenly don’t want to talk much or hang out anymore. I don’t get it.

I graduated college with great academics but not much to show for it in the way of friendships. For career reasons, I decided to do a masters program at again one of the best colleges. But I seem to be struggling with the same problem. I can have great conversations with a lot of people. But I don’t have a group. And sometimes I’ll arrange things with people, but people have yet to invite me to anything, except for birthday parties. I want to be hanging out with people, going out, having a good time. Yet I seem to be alone on Friday night, again, while everyone else is doing exactly that. 

I can’t seem to break this cycle I seem to be stuck in. I think my Aspergers may be a part of why I can’t connect in the same way that others do, but I can’t seem to figure out what I’m doing wrong, even with therapy. I don’t know how much more of this I can take.",Stoicism,1705092228.0,t3_19559zv,0.5,0

[DISCUSSION] Investigating Anger is the answer,"Good morning Stoa, a few days ago I came here after I had an *incident*. I got angry and lost my temper.

It was very uncool of me, and that lead to a lot of introspection, analysis, reflections, writing, and research.  

Not only I have come to the realization that I was wrong, but that I have been wrong all my life.

I had the wrong belief systems and worldviews, which rendered my analysis of the situations faulty.

Regardless that I was wronged, I had no business at getting angry, let alone losing my temper. That is never the answer to anything. I had faulty belief systems.

I have reframed my thinking and my belief systems, thanks in partly to Stoicism.

Today I am a better man, I still have work to do to better myself, and I know that the episode was a tilting point in my life.

I thank this sub for providing me with great comments and continuing to provide a source of sanity.

So after job i journal, and since i found a ton of flaws in my behaviour, and my actions i figured that i would ask for advice. Im new to the proces and Im gonna try for a week and see if i Can understand it better. For me This id Big progress. SO, i analysed how i was during the day, what do i have to do now?

Do I have to find solutions?

How should you actually read Meditations?,"So long story short...I've been an admirer and reader of the Stoics, particularly Marcus Aurelius, for years. What I'm trying to do is to practice the virtues sufficiently that they become habit and second-nature to me - something that probably will take years if not decades to accomplish. It's a really difficult task and I've messed up (pretty badly) on multiple occasions.

And so I often ask myself the question ""How did \[insert Stoic\] do it?"" At least for Marcus Aurelius it seems part of the answer was keeping himself accountable with his personal journal - what we read as Meditations today. And Meditations is a beautiful book, just...I've found it really hard to read. The problem might be the version, I'm using the Hicks version, but it's always seemed like a collection impossibly difficult maxims that I could appreciate in a moment of serenity but not in a moment of crisis.

Is the problem the version I'm using? Am I studying Meditations wrong? Is it just my fault for being slow-witted? Any advice would be much appreciated.

I live in Brazil and everything here is so loud and confusing and every day I need to deal with a bunch of Ignorant people 

I’m just tired, I’m almost a quarter of a century old and I’ve wasted my life up to this point,  I have no personal achievements, no driving license (I failed the exam), no romantic relationship (although I don’t really care about that just think that it would be nice), no discipline and don’t know how to have it 

Im going to finish college this year and I didn’t even picked what I wanted to graduate, my mom chose that I was gonna be a dentist behind my back without consulting me, and I really don’t want to be a dentist 

I’ve had my ups and downs during those years but they were mostly bad, I’ve cried for no reason during most of my days, have contemplated suicide in a lot of occasions and I’m generally just screaming in my mind “I WANT TO DIE WHAT AM I DOING HERE ?!?!” while looking calm on the outside

"How Stoicism Helped Me Throughout the Years, Despite Key Misunderstandings","*I hope this little tale can serve as inspiration for those of you interested in Stoicism only as a shield and less so as a toolbox. A*s it turned out for me, it provided and even more powerful operating system.

&#x200B;

I first stumbled upon Stoicism in 2012 as a graduate. I read ""Letters from a Stoic"" as I imagine newly converted Christians read the Bible; quite literally and with great joy and fulfillment.

At the time, I was a young man who had listened to everything from Dan Pena, Joe Dispenza, and to some extent Tony Robbins, even though he always seemed too ""guru-ish"" for me to really believe in. Stoicism provided me with the operating system I needed at the time.

However, I mistook being stoic for not letting emotions get to me. This served me very well for years. I overcame one challenge after another, climbed the corporate ladder quickly, and moved all over Europe in search of additional personal and professional growth. By many metrics, I was a young successful man with everything ahead of me.

One day, I realized my current job and life situation were no longer challenging. Despite making good money, living in a safe and affluent city, and earning a decent amount while traveling often, I was bored. I needed action. So, I took the leap, leaving that job for another and moving once again to a different city in Europe.

It was shortly after making the decision to move again that I realized much of my boredom and lack of growth where I was actually had very little to do with my surroundings, and everything to do with myself. By, in a Stoic manner, turning off most of my emotions, both the highs and lows of my intense life felt bland.

Shortly after, I returned to Stoicism and this forum. I realized that Stoicism is really about accepting feelings and then ""applying"" Stoicism, instead of using it as a mental filter to mute feelings and numb sensations. At one point, I was afraid that this new approach would make me lose one of my strongest abilities in life: to endure hardship.

But, as it turns out, this new way of interpreting Stoicism, for me, provided an even more powerful operating system to tackle everyday life. I learned how to accept feelings, embrace them, and power through. The acceptance step became crucial, as it helped me feel pain, enabling fruitful reflection and therefore progress.

I hope this little tale can serve as inspiration for those of you interested in Stoicism only as a shield and less so as a toolbox. If possible, try to repeat my misstake :)",Stoicism,1704895967.0,t3_19396dw,0.93,12

The Jean Valjean problem. Does stoicism indeed say he should not steal bread?,"Wanted to raise this question after listening to a discussion on a podcast. I am having some issues with it, so I'm coining the phrase the Jean Valjean problem  


In Les Miserables, Jean Valjean steals bread and is cast into prison for it. He eventually escapes and becomes a better person. 


The problem for stoicism as I understand it is the theft part. I may not understand stoicism correctly here,  but I believe that since stoics state virtue is the highest goal, and that our own life is less important than this, stealing a loaf of bread to survive (assuming for the sake of argument it is a life and death situation,  no escaping the thought experiment by claiming another option like borrowing money to buy bread) is considered less virtuous than not stealing and succumbing to death. 


I am not sure if this is a correct interpretation,  but I cannot agree with it for 2 eeasons:


1) Life isn't worthless. The value of continuing life at the expense of stolen bread is worth it. The value of a life is more than a loaf of bread so even though theft is not virtuous, it is excusable in this situation. 


2) life is worthwhile specifically because permitting a life to continue,  even at the expense of virtue, means that the person can grow and become virtuous over time. They cannot do that if they are dead.

Seeking comfort after dog’s loss,"My childhood dog, best friend and only company has passed away after fighting tumours for last 4 months. I am 22. Yesterday was supposed to be a regular veterinary visit and schedule to remove one tumour. He was 12, turned it just 1 month ago and was a golden retriever. He had multiple tumours which were operated and taken out, but one kept coming for the third time. It was his 4th operation in 4 months. Last days he was not eating and drinking that much as his tumour was in his mouth and was bleeding and hurting him. He went to the car so happy, full of life. I knew that it would take him but not that quick. Vet took him to immediate operation as his tumour started bleeding heavily, and we were told to pick him up in few hours. Upon arriving, the vet said he removed it and that he is slowly waking up but still bleeding so he advises to leave him overnight. At 9PM we got a call that he passed away after failed reanimation. My world broke.

We didn’t properly said goodbye. I can’t believe that the last picture of him is from yesterday shortly before leaving. My family is broken too. What hurts me is that he died without us, after promising him that we will pick him up as usual. Last night was tough, barely slept at all.

It shook me to my core as I remember passing of my grandpa which was a huge part of my life, let’s say the same way (without anyone, alone in hospital bed due to Covid).

I’m at a loss.,"For some background information I’m a high school senior who’s graduating in 4 months.

For the past 3 years of high school, an individual in my friend group has talking mad shit about me. Whether it’s about my failed romantic endeavors or something embarrassing I’ve done, he has not failed to bring it up in conversation with random people to make himself look better. As a result, my close friends have told me many people think I’m a bitch for letting him say this shit to me and not do anything back (I was raised to not inflict violence unless my life is danger).

This mindset has done irreparable damage to my reputation- people think I’m a pussy and hella girls aren’t interested because they think I’m a clown. It actually hurts man.

how do I attain happiness in my routine and life?," I've recently reflected on what had brought me joy in the past, the current moment and also could in the future. This is a copy of my thoughts, and I'd love to hear other people's thoghts on it :)

so, how do I attain happiness in my daily routine and life? 

Everyone want to be happy, and there are different ways for people to achieve that, each person has their own way that they persue. Taking my mates for example, at least what I see on the outside, they occasionally go out to parties, get high and drink, eat junk food and those are usually their highlights of the day. 

But that's not what I truely enjoy doing. Literally today, had my first pizza in probably three years, and it was seriously pretty bad. The taste was actually aweful. I felt nauseous afterwards, and regardless if I had a group involvement in my class I would prefer to pick a different, more nutricous meal for lunchtime. Thinking back to when I had a streak of a couple of days of being active, excercising and eating enough nutricous food, I literally get a sense of freedom, acomplishment and expecially peace.  

This was one of the things that brings me back to my question: How do I find happiness and purpose? Since it doesn't seem like a reasonable option to have a completely concrete step-by-step plan to be happy, since things change and you need to adapt, but I am aware many perspectives, healthy and unhealthy, picking the option for delayed or instant gradification, and in the long run it's always better to opt for the delayed, healthy option. Just recently I've watched a video, it's blantly obvious but the things that you are doing now are not effecting you right now, but rather the things you did years, months, days prior do. And in reverse your future depends on what you literally do at the current moment.  

So how do I attain happiness in my routine and in life?  

I need to find a balance between work and life.  

Currently I need to get education going and persue the path of excellence in academics. Afterwards I will be able to have a job that is high paying, so I can do whatever I want, not be constrained by a lack of rescources. Of course not to forget that for long term happiness it's highly important to pick a job that you actually enjoy doing, possibly using the method of ikagai, and also considering your established type of intelligence that you were born with (reference from a podcast that robert freene was on and mentioned that matter in his book mastery, the types are: linguistic, logical-mathematical, inter/-arpersonal, naturalistic, musical, kinesthetic and spacial intelligence; source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/harvard-psychologist-types-of-intelligence-where-do-you-score-highest-in.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/harvard-psychologist-types-of-intelligence-where-do-you-score-highest-in.html) ) Additionally, reflecting on the chliche suggestion that you should be enjoying your teen years while you can (go out and party, get drunk, high, not care about what you fuel your body with, when you sleep, etc.) I personally don't consider that view of ""enjoying your young teens"" as true enjoyment.  

In the moment in which I reach the top of a mountain after a high hike, having delicous dinner after a long day, waking up for a tasty breakfast, the morning sky, the sunset, the sun rise, the colors that the sky can take during different hours of the day, the way clouds move though out atmosphere, the acomplishment when you start comprehending an interesting topic, having deeptalk with a friend, the butterflies that you suddenly get when seeing a certain someonehaving music literally run through your veins when inducing it or just listening; the flow when reading an incaptivating book, the adrenaline kick when doing some crazy activity, sights of cities, landmarks, nature, different cultures, architecture, languages, customs, fashion or just calm walks acompanied by your close ones or just just yourself; there are endless opportunities that are here to be discovered, literally endless.  

Drifting back to reality, above I've listed multiple examples of things, that some far have brought sincere joy to my life and contributed to my life's purpose. Ejoying existing while growing for the betterment of myself and humanity. Obviously those moments cannot, at the time that I'm writing this down, happen on a daily basis. Right now I am given the opportunity, all ressources necessary, to educate myself, get a job and open the door for many more occassions which will bring me joy. 

It's absolutely obligatory for me not to let into brainfog, to start neglecting my health and being able to enjoy the simplicity and beauty of raw nature due to my dopanime receptors (and just my physical and mental condition) be fried to the brim of exctintion. Not let myself forget the hidden dangers of instant gradification and get in a hellish loop that day by day would bring me closer to depression, anxiety, shame and even death.  

So how do I balance my work and free time in a sustainable, meaningful way? 

It is of significance to consider that laying out an unrealistic schedule of a self-improvement type of guru is not going to be beneficial because of multiple reasons. The motive of it isn't really wrong, but the execution is usually not backed by scientific proof, and a sense of purpose. Why do so many people fail their new years resulution? Quiet frankly, they are not thinking about both long and short term dradification. There needs to be a balanced amount of both, else (at least that's what it's been like for me) it's not maintainable. It's so simple to skip going to the gym and  just have that last junky snack, because it's so much easier to do so. Instead just show up to the gym, don't obligate yourself to do a full on three hour workout, seriously just show up and do the bare minimun. Only thrity minutes is totally enough. If you've done, and keep picking this option consistenly, then you can do whatever would please you afterwards. Usually when you've already brought yourself to start, show up for that half an hour, is what it needs to get the stone rolling for a more productive way of living. You will get endorphines by doing the sport, a happy hormone, and the meal after excersising always tastes better if youre slightly worn out.  

And if you consistenly repeat an effective, maintainable routine, you will eventually reach a point where you can do whatever, whenever, with the people you love. That doesn't mean you can't do those things in the process of getting there, it is of most significace that you incooperate enough healthy happiness boosting activities into your routine in order to be able to sustain the discipline. Because in words it's easier written than done, actually do the due paper, decline unhealthy habits, but it can be done. You need to reward youself with ""natural"" induced gradification (note: look these methods up, backed up science based evidence), self reflection, self awareness and a sense of purpose.  

It's impossible to summarrise how to have a sense of purpose briefly, but the main point is that every person has their own, evolving purpose/reason to live for. Since the world is evoling and so many things are out of my control, I rather focus on the things that are in my power, like picking to go on a peaceful walk, enjoy a couple minutes of chilling with my loving cat, etc, that give me some direction of purpose. Do things that are genuinly meaningful to me.  ",Stoicism,1704761683.0,t3_1921ix9,0.86,5

I am going through incredible pressure from my surroundings and the feeling of being stabbed in the back.," 

About a year ago, I started a project with a few friends at that time. We were just a branch of a larger project that someone initiated in the capital city. The completion of that project was supposed to bring benefits to all of us. Hoping for a positive outcome, I handed over complete control to my friend at that time. We went through a tough period together, working hard and under a lot of stress. I lost 5kg due to anxiety, and it also cost me a lot of money. The project was completed a few months ago. The people in charge in the capital city are now working and reaping the benefits. I waited for them to call me and offer something, a job or a way to earn money, because we went through all of that together. However, they never contacted me. Now I find out that all this time, they were communicating with my friend who was the coordinator for my area, but he pushed me aside and is collecting benefits for his closest circle of people and family. I am practically excluded from the story even though I did everything that everyone else did, even more. My family and friends ask me every day when something will come out of it, when I can expect something. Some people even have expectations that I can help them, even though I can't help myself. It's very difficult to be deceived and betrayed, especially in a small town. I don't know what to do; I don't have contact with people from the capital city. Also, I wouldn't want to confront my 'friend' because maybe something will come from him.

What is the *""Stoic""* answer?

We know that the world runs mostly on emotionally-driven decisions, we see it every day; so is it *silly* to wish otherwise? Should we as Stoics be like Ninjas, not wishing that the world were different, but improvise, adapt, and overcome life's situations as they manifest themselves to us?

I come from a muslim family and they don’t know and alot of my fear stems from them finding out and selfishly I stay at home as a dependent and save money and plan to move once I graduate university.

For new Stoics...,"With the popularity of Stoicism, like from Ryan Holiday and Massimo Pigliucci. People new to Stoicism should learn that they are referred to as Modern Stoics, which is a secular part of Traditional Stoicism. They leave out the most important part of Traditional Stoicism, Providence, and living according to Nature. If you read Marcus, Seneca, and Epictetus, Nature is foundational and is the only way Stoicism truly works to reach eudaimonia or happiness.

"The Jedi code sounds like it was written by a stoic, and the Sith code a hedonist.","*There is no emotion, there is peace*.  

*There is no ignorance, there is knowledge.*  

*There is no passion, there is serenity.*  

*There is no chaos, there is harmony.*  

*There is no death, there is the Force.*  

The first line I’m not sure I completely agree with. There are things like rational joy, but in a broader sense I think stoics would at least agree in part. Emotions are contrived from our judgments, which are a construct. Inner peace though is a common stoic theme, and is the result of sound judgment, not false beliefs assented into emotion.

The second line reminds me of a theme in stoicism that the true stoic sage is never upset, because he only has knowledge. Socrates famously said “the only sin is ignorance”.  

The third line is another stoic tenant. Marcus Aurelius talks in the meditations often about avoiding passions as they can take away from your rationality and sound judgment. A good sound judgment and an understanding of nature, will result in a natural sense of serenity and joy.  

The fourth line is again, often brought up in stoicism. I interpret chaos here as “unnatural”. Everything is natural, therefore nothing can be unnatural or chaotic. Chaos is a perception. A vicious storm isn’t chaotic, it’s just a storm. A result of nature that brings harmony and balance.  

And finally the last line. I’m not precisely sure what metaphor is meant by *there is no death*, as there is of course death. Maybe they meant you ought not to fear death. Maybe they meant you never really die because you’re resorbed back into the force. And the force could be interpreted in stoic physics as *the logos* as the ancient philosophers say.  

With all that dissected here is the sith code by contrast. You can make your own interpretations, but I think it’s clear why this doctrine is adopted by “the baddies” in the Star Wars universe. It clearly leads to a troubled, never satisfied, self destructive, vice consuming soul.  

*Peace is a lie. There is only Passion.*  

*Through Passion, I gain Strength.*  

*Through Strength, I gain Power.*  

*Through Power, I gain Victory.*  

*Through Victory my chains are Broken.*

Human Will vs Uncontrollable Thoughts,"Hey everybody,

Having recently read Sharon Lebell's ""Art of Living"" & Seneca's ""On Anger"", I'd like some help with dealing with my very angry thoughts. Although I work well within my locus of control i.e. ""controlling the reaction"" as Seneca states, my mind is still filled with violent and angry thoughts of vengeance on the people who've wronged me. I know and understand that anything coming from Anger is wrong, but these thoughts still penetrate my mind. I've tried meditating on these thoughts for months, and although I've gotten much better at controlling my reaction, I still feel the initial reaction all the same.

Are there any readings discussing prevention of these angry thoughts in the first place, or is this outside of our locus of control & it is simply something we should let be.

Thanks,",Stoicism,1704617878.0,t3_190o1k5,0.57,1
How to stop desiring women,"Im a single 31 yr old man, my whole life ive felt alone, sad, and sometimes depressed. My parents were verbally abusive to each other before they seperated after 25 yrs. I have always been alone, i never got a gf, not for the lack of trying via dating apps. I even went to south east asia, and paid for escorts just to not feel lonely, to feel like i have someone who pretends to like me for 1 hr, honestly that was a mistake.

I want to stop desiring women. I have been addicted to porn, now that has significantly reduced to just seeing some scantily clad women on instagram. I dont want to look at couples in restaurant or malls and feel sad and start crying. I dont want to think i am inferior or less human because im not attractive. I dont even want this though, like need to turn this feeling off.

what advise would you give this indian man? i have lost hope of happiness, i think i wont even get married, i have been trying for arranged marriage.

How to reconcile Aurelius's murder of Christians with his Stoicism,"So I was telling someone the other day how much I loved Marcus Aurelius, and how much his ""Meditations"" meant to me, and what a cool philosopher he was, et al, and she said ""I used to love him, too. Then I found out he massacred a bunch of Christians by feeding them to wild animals. Now I won't read him."" 

I'll be honest, I had no idea about this, so I googled it, and she was more or less exactly correct. Now, I understand that the times were the times, and Roman Emperors were not pacifists, and that Christians were seen as sort of a crazy fringe cult at the time. But still, how does one reconcile Aurelius's repeated musings about leading an ethical life and being decent to others with this part of his history? Again, I'm not an expert.

"On Virtue, Asceticism and the Request for Help","Hi everyone

I would like to ask you what exercises you need to do in order to grow in virtue. I read Marcus Aurelius several times, but I abandoned it in favor of the diatribes and the encheiridiona of Epictetus. I also read Cicero, whom I like very much because of his understanding of virtue.

1 Specific question: what do you think about asceticism as a preferential good that purifies all vices from man? Such as laziness, lack of self-discipline, and so on. Of course, this serves as a preliminary stage, for it is known that the man who tilles the soil, has uprooted the weeds, cut the earth, and sows or plants, that is, develops virtues. That's not to say that he hasn't done it before, but that getting rid of the superfluous helps. What do you think? (P.S. I'm a fan of Cynic asceticism)

2  Can virtue be exercised and will it always be present until we neglect it? I'm afraid that virtue is only an exercise of judgments in the mind that we hold onto, and that when they are lacking, it turns out that there is no virtue and never has been? After all, if it turns out that Stoic virtue is just a matter of the mind, I think I'd rather have Cicero's teaching on virtue than the Greek masters.

3  Do you have any internships that you can recommend to me? The reason I'm asking you this is that I'd rather deal with practices than just theoretical scripts on a lot of websites. I believe I can learn a lot from you, so if you would like to share some advice with me, I will be happy to hear it.

Please be patient and understanding, I'm not even sure if I gave the right flair (I'm sorry if I chose the wrong one). I try to learn new things and analyze what I already know, whether what I knew was really right.

Best regards!

How to manage stress in gaming (and in general)?,"I'm a young man getting slowly into stoicism. It is like 4th day since i started reading about it more (I'm still in the middle of reading one of William B. Irvine's books, it's my first). I like playin a lot of dynamic, stressful games like e.g. ULTRAKILL. I think im playing rationally - trying some tactics, doing stuff to manage problems (prioritizing enemies, defending yourself etc.). Nontheless tend to feel a lot of stress. At first i was still raging, hitting my desk, but today i felt a bit of a progress - i was still very stressed, i sometimes felt angry, however i remained calm and ""took a deep breath"" and went ahead. It might be also be caused by the fact i'm at my grandma and i don't want to make noise.
This applies to even some activities. In fact, i feel stress rn writing this (dunno why exactly tho). After trying to imply Irvine's suggestions in my daily life i feel better - i usually felt like people want the worst for me and they treat me as someome worse. Nowadays i feel less affected, like i don't care. Only time i felt bad was when my friend called PlayStation 3 gay (yes, he has xbox lmao) as i have huge nostalgia for this console.
What i want to ask in summary - is there a way to calm myself down after a big dose of stress and is it bad for me, as a stoic, to feel stressed in gaming?",Stoicism,1704558937.0,t3_1903u81,0.5,0
Hi Stoics! Lend me your ear a moment please!,"Hey guys. I feel the desire to be very detailed here but I’ll try to keep it short and hopefully not break any rules while I’m at it.

I am 40 years old and I’m about 3 years outside of deconstructing from a lifelong Baptist brainwa… I mean, faith. I had always butted heads with fellow Christians, I always felt like it was all pretty fake and vain, and I was one of those delirious young Christians who thought I had a special connection with God, a certain special empathy for other human beings or something.

Anyways, when I was 35, my left foot started going numb and I figured it was just a pinched nerve in my back. Fast forward 3 years and now the numbness spread to my whole body, and even neurologists at Cleveland Clinic can’t figure it out, and say it has to be something genetic. (This is where I could really ramble, so I’ll stop myself here).

This was the straw that broke the Camel’s back, this is what finally pushed me through deconstruction and take that terrifying leap of ironic faith. I read a few books like Leaving the Fold, Age of Reason, etc. A lot of books on buddhism were also helpful in learning to meditate, but I felt like it was flirting too much with religion.

Then I read Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations, and that was it. Lights out, this dude spoke the language of my very soul. I’m happy to have found Stoicism! My biggest problem is that I am still so very hung up on my anger and resentment towards Yahweh, its so bad that it colors almost all of my thoughts. I still feel like a dictator is lording over everything. I still mentally lash out at him in my darkest times, even though I know I’m screaming at the void.

So, long story short, how do I kick this Jesus habit? Thanks for reading and sorry if I offended anyone. That snarky, passive aggressiveness towards Christianity is THE very thing I’m trying to address.

Edit: I know I could and should post this over in the ex-christian sub, and I’m definitely a lurker over there, but it can be a bit of an echo-chamber in there.",Stoicism,1704557978.0,t3_1903h7a,0.75,6

I've began working out consistently, being active in my daughters' lives and being a husband for as long as I am given.

Is this correct?,"So i have started studying stoicism and its been two months, and i have been journaling about a month of the thoughts am having daily and the judgements i pass onto things i try to examine those.

I won't go into much details and make this really long. Here's a brief context of the stuff that happened. Well i do corporate job and everyday we have requests which gets assigned to our team and whoever available senior will assign it to the resource who is available on that day. The problem is things get suddenly escalated to higher management and we need to complete those tasks ASAP.

What has happened one of the senior on my team assigned the request/task to me while i was on my week off. I got angry as to why she assigned the task but i did not confronted her because i was angry i just took the action just to remind her not to assign to someone who is in week off.

And i journaled the whole thing.

and it goes something like this.

Anger  
\------------------

An emotion which happens. When thare is Something unjust has happened.

Did that thing did unjust to me?

Well it was unjust. But let's not get into conclusion.

Let's think it this way.

Is assigning tasks is Something People Shouldn't do?Y  
es they should.

If they Should do then whom they should assign?  
The People who are available.

Now did she assign to Someone who was available on that day?  
NO .

I mean you do not serve food to a Person , who is not there to eat.

Then we know that you should assign the task to Someone who is available .

NOW

Is assigning task to Someone who is not available is an unjust act?

Its not an unjust act as she doesn't have knowledge as to who was available and who was not.

Hence anger should not have come there but we did not assent to that and did not made an impulsive act.

Afraid of how my family would react to my lack of beliefs,"Yeah that's basicallly it. In a nutshell, i was raised by a loving christian family and ended up becoming an atheist a year ago, without them knowing it. 
I love my family more than anything, and they help me a lot, my brother is like a father to me as he taught me a lot of the values i have today, in which some correlate to that of Stoicism.
But the problem is, i stopped believing in God. I am not seeking for religious advice or anything, because it just doesn't make sense to me in believing in a religion again, what i am struggling with is how to deal with it when it comes to my family. I know they would get sad and maybe even exclude me for it... I feel helpless because as far as i am concerned i am the only one in my family that doesn't believe in the religion and that makes me feel lonely and unmotivated.
Not only that, but oftentimes i feel like i am being too selfish, in the sense of ""They did everything to me and now you just leave everything"", specially towards my mom who struggled a lot to raise me.
Its been weeks i am dealing with this, and this questioning in my head is destroying me, i just can't work properly anymore with all of this.
I would like to know how me, as a someone who considers myself a stoic should deal with this, i even considered returning to the faith but i did that twice before and i relapsed back to atheism and i am afraid it could happen again

When is it okay to give unsolicited advice?,"Hello,

&#x200B;

I tried looking for a similar thread but found only posts talking about receiving unsolicited advice rather than giving it. So, I apologize if I'm retreading ground here.

&#x200B;

Basically though, I find my relationships with my friends suffer because I give off an aloof disposition (not on purpose). Many times my friends will bring up a problem they are having and I'm usually quiet. This is because I am worried about unsolicited advice or otherwise overstepping boundaries.

&#x200B;

I know it's quite okay to voice my opinion when explicitly asked, but find it harder to do so when my friends only imply they'd like advice. And often, I'm not even sure if that IS what they're implying.

&#x200B;

Because of this I think finding a deeper connection is sometimes difficult. Maybe I give off the vibe that I don't care, or perhaps it seems I am trying to change the subject outright.

&#x200B;

I also feel like I am denying my friends the decision as well. And I'm denying them a deeper insight into who I am that kind of prevents them from being comfortable around me. Maybe it seems like I'm hiding something or am coming off judgemental/stern.

&#x200B;

Well, what do you guys think? Am I caring too much what my friends think of me when I'm silent/reserved? Or do I just need to care more about authenticity? And when is proactively giving unsolicited advice acceptable?

&#x200B;

Would love to hear your thoughts on this. Thanks for your time and hope you're all well.

I am an old(er) Redditor and I have come a long way in my life; up until not long ago I thought that my life was pretty great, then the other day I lost my temper, something that had not happened in a very long time, and that I thought it was gone from my personality; but there I was. And it was ugly. I was ugly. Details withheld because they don't matter. Losing one's temper is uncalled for. Period.

But my reflections on what happens has led me to keen observation of my MO(s) and behavior, and I have come to the realization that:

1. I don't perform well in confrontations
2. I don't perform well under stress (stress real or imagined)
3. I play ""nice"" by default, but then turn ugly in situations #1 and #2 above.
4. So really, I am not that ""nice"".

I started keeping a journal of the worst things that happen to me every day.,"About a week ago, I started keeping a little journal on my notes app of the worst things that happened to me each day.


It has helped me to change the way I view things and to realize just how insignificant most of the little daily “evils” I encounter are. 


This is my list from the last few days:


MONDAY: broke the yolk of the egg I was cooking.

TUESDAY: stepped on some dog poop barefoot.

WEDNESDAY: woke up at 3:30 because my son was crying, couldn’t go back to sleep.

THURSDAY: son went to bed about an hour later than usual. 


This has helped me to stop catastrophizing a ton. I was grumpy all week. And the worst thing that happened was I lost some sleep and some free time and also stepped in poo. If that’s the worst thing that happens this week, fortune’s smiling on me. 


Of course, if I were to get fired, or have a loved one die, it would definitely be worse than those things, but it would likely help me appreciate the good days all the more. 


Try giving it a shot, you’ll likely find that most troubles are not of dire consequence.

Edit to add: I know I should have a stoic journal where I write about how I respond to situations, work on virtues, etc. That being said, I don’t have a ton of time, and this is definitely a 30-second exercise rather than even five minutes",Stoicism,1704491909.0,t3_18ziu36,0.86,14

In love with an addict,"I'm in love with an addict, and I recently our relationship. When I broke up with him, I told him that part of the reason I was ending things was that I loved him too much to watch him kill himself. I was experiencing a lot of emotional distress because of his addiction and the way he was letting it impact his life and our relationship. He's a truly beautiful man, with a heart like none I've ever met and more love to give that I ever knew was possible, but was destroying his health and making it impossible to maintain a romantic relationship. 

From a Stoic perspective, I'm curious how to navigate our post-breakup friendship or whether I should not have one with him.  

Would growing as a Stoic mean learning to accept his self-destructive tendencies, and choose to serve as a support and friend if he chooses to get sober? Would it mean lovingly holding him accountable when he asks for support, and pointing out his patterns when he wants advice? 

Or would growing as a Stoic mean accepting that a leopard cannot change its spots, accepting that remaining in his life may be harming us both more than anything, and walking away?

As we call a statue Phidiac, which is fashioned according to the art of Phidias; so show me a man who is fashioned according to the doctrines which he utters. Show me a man who is sick and happy, in danger and happy, dying and happy, in exile and happy, in disgrace and happy. Show him: I desire, by the gods, to see a Stoic. You cannot show me one fashioned so; but show me at least one who is forming, who has shown a tendency to be a Stoic. Do me this favour: do not grudge an old man seeing a sight which I have not seen yet. Do you think that you must show me the Zeus of Phidias or the Athena, a work of ivory and gold? Let any of you show me a human soul ready to think as God does, and not to blame either God or man, ready not to be disappointed about any thing, not to consider himself damaged by any thing, not to be angry, not to be envious, not to be jealous; and why should I not say it direct? desirous from a man to become a god, and in this poor mortal body thinking of his fellowship with Zeus.

Virtue is the only good. Not the reach for contentment.

We embrace/love/wish for whatever happens/has happened and do not worry so much about how other's define/label that. We are happy in whatever is going on because what does that have to do with our character?

We deal with life as it happens, and do not lose our way. This includes opinions, authors and ""sophists"" we do not agree with. As Epictetus and Seneca both share, we can objectively describe a thing for what it is, we observe that a course called ""The Wealthy Stoic"" sounds like a contradiction and a confusion, but it isn't Stoic to then assign that value to the person beyond that observation.

This is Stoicism. If this doesn't feel right, then maybe there is a false impression somewhere in there to work through, or maybe this isn't the philosophy your nature is set to follow?

Lost,"

So right now I(20m) am in my third year of college and honestly I have no idea what I’m doing as in I don’t know what to do with my life. The bachelor that I’m studying for now is biology not because I’m necessarily interested in it but because engineering is too hard for me considering I suck at math and political science is also uninteresting to me.
All throughout my life/high school people would ask me what I was going to study and I would always tell them “I didn’t know” thinking that eventually I would know and I could answer their question and my question but here I am and I still don’t know. I haven’t found anything that really interests me nothing to the extent I could see myself devoting time and effort into it. I play a lot of video games but I don’t like it enough for me to learn how to make a game and I watch a lot of movies and TV shows, but don’t like them enough to pursue a career in cinema for example and to top it all off I’m not good at anything(no talent,no secret hobbies,nothing). I’m trying not to sound ungrateful, but to put it simply nothing is ever enough It all feels empty to me. People have told me that it’s normal to be directionless in this stage in life and I understand that but at the same time is very frustrating seeing my friends in college just knowing what they’re going to do with themselves whether it be veterinarians, lawyers, programmers you name it and I wish I could be like them. Needless to say, this is all having a negative affect on me is bad enough to go through life’s struggles, but I would say its worse when you don’t have a “why” to your struggles. I don’t feel like I’m asking for too much when it comes to just knowing what I should do. I’m not asking for that perfect dream job. All I want is to know what I should be doing with my life, something that I can see myself doing for a long time and be good at it, and get meaning from it but I don’t have that and I need help. When somebody asks me, who am I, what are you doing and what am I going to do I want to actually give a real answer.

My plates arrived all broken,"I'm going to move out of my mother's house in July but have already started buying some things and keeping them stored. A week ago, I bought a set of 10 plates from a fancy store, I spent some amount of money on it but nothing out of my reality.

I'm thinking about just throwing the broken plates in the trash (carefully packed of course) and buy new ones soon from a different place.

Question concerning the Stoic view on abuse from family.,"
I have some issues with a stoic view on abusive family and I’m curious how you all interpret the passage. 

Very quick backstory: After years of therapy I’ve stopped speaking with my mother due to narcissism and abuse. 

Stoicism has been one of the most valuable things in my life and has helped me through so much. I have been very troubled upon a re-reading of Epictetus and would love your interpretation.

“Duties are universally measured by relations. Is a man a father? The precept is to take care of him, to yield to him in all things, to submit when he is reproachful, when he inflicts blows. But suppose that he is a bad father. Were you then by nature made akin to a good father? No; but to a father. Does a brother wrong you? Maintain then your own position toward him, and do not examine what he is doing, but what you must do that your will shall be conformable to nature. For another will not damage you, unless you choose: but you will be damaged then when you shall think that you are damaged. In this way then you will discover your duty from the relation of a neighbor, from that of a citizen, from that of a general, if you are accustomed to contemplate the relations.”

In the book A Field Guide to a Happy Life, Massimo Pigliucci’s rewrites Epictetus in more modern language. Here is another example of a stoic response to abuse from family.

“But,” you say, “my mother has been bad to me.” Perhaps, but she is your mother nevertheless, and you should concern yourself with how you behave toward her, not how she behaves toward you. “But my brother has done me some harm.” What do you mean, “harm”? Has he forced you to change your considered opinions or the values you endorse? No, he can’t do that. Then there is no real harm. He may have behaved unjustly toward you, but that is his business. Your business is to behave toward him by considering who he is: your brother.

So, after years of therapy, I have broken off my relationship with my mother. It was a very difficult decision but the correct choice. Reading these stoic passages that I have posted really upsets me. Does Epictetus really expect someone to allow pain and suffering inflicted upon them just because you are related to them? Standing up for ourselves and choosing not to be harmed is within our own power, so I had thought I made the stoic decision to choose not to be harmed anymore. Perhaps this passage from Epictetus is a relic of ancient times in which you could never sever ties with family regardless of the situation.

What do you think?",Stoicism,1704445748.0,t3_18z2mw3,0.61,2
"I need practical, real-life advice on being alone.","I don't lack social skills or anything like that, I just don't particularly like most of the people I go to college with. The people that I do actually like, never show up to class/ come very rarely so I can't really hang out with them.

I enjoy my own company and do not feel the need to spend all of my time with people, but it gets exhausting to not have anyone to talk to/ hangout with during breaks in between classes and such. Studying during these breaks doesn't always work and I do start to feel lonely/ crave social interaction.

What should I do? I need some help/ motivation to be able to make it through college.

Wondering about this quote.,"Hi everyone. This is my first post ever on Reddit and I hope I did respect the rules… 

I found this quote an hour ago on Stoic. And to be honest, I’m really new to Stoicism and I’m wondering how to interpret it. 

« Floods will rob us of one thing, fire of another. These are conditions of our existence which we cannot change. What we can do is adopt a noble spirit, such a spirit as befits a good man, so that we may bear up bravely under all that fortune sends us and bring our wills into tune with nature’s. » Seneca, Letters from a Stoic

To be more precise, I don’t understand what the first sentence have to deal with the rest. If some people can lighten my mind it would be great!",Stoicism,1704439480.0,t3_18z12id,0.67,3
Seneca on duties,"Seneca asserts, citing Democritus, that 'a relatively tranquil state of mind is only possible if we devote relatively little time to public or private affairs, or at least to those that are too great for our strength' in Book 3 Chapter 6 of 'On Anger'. He then goes on to suggest avoiding hunger, thirst, hard study or tasks

I was surprised by this. Having read the Meditations I had the impression that it was best to drive oneself strenuously into one's duties and enduring difficulties by accepting the present moment and modifying judgements. Seneca himself condemns laziness in his letters to Lucilius.

How is this to be reconciled? Is it about working within one's present limits, like someone starting out in exercise, who must begin lightly to avoid injuries that a dedicated trainer would manage with ease?",Stoicism,1704427040.0,t3_18yxc51,0.81,6

A Stoic's Code of Conduct and how to achieve Emotional Maturity and/or remedy Emotional Immaturity.,"I've been practicing Stoicism for a couple of years now, and I do see some improvements. So I am not a newbie and I know better that Stoicism is not about repressing emotions.

Like many of us, my upbringing was not perfect (and I have stopped blaming my parents long ago), and I had a lot of ""issues"".  I have come a long way, I do live a ""normal"" life, dare to say ""happy""; some people would even use the term ""successful"" to describe my life and me.

But I am still working on myself, constantly improving.

Recently I am working on my latent internal anger, and I have come to the realization that I am still, probably, Emotionally Immature.

I have got some good comments on this sub recently on related matters, and I am journaling multiple times a day, reflecting on things, and challenging my own *intrusive thoughts* and also my *Belief System* (aka BS).

I have read multiple times Massimo Pigliucci's *How to be a Stoic*, and William Irvine's *A Guide to the Good Life*; they are book good in giving practical examples of Stoic life.

I am looking to make a simple ""Stoic's Code of Conduct"", a list so to speak that I can review multiple times a day, and in case of emergency, and therefore I am asking 2 questions:

1. Do you have such a list or can you point me to one?
2. Can you please review my incomplete list below, and suggest additions/edits?

TIA

My Stoic Code of Conduct:

* Speak positively.
* Don't be sarcastic (I used to do it too much).
* Never complain.
* Judge a situation or a behavior, not the person.  What someone does is not the reflection of who they are.
* Never say anything negative about anyone (linked to the item above), even if it's true (this is regarding work).
* Pursue the Stoic virtues (of course), always.
* Apply the dichotomy of control, always.
* Don't give into consumerism, lean toward minimalism.
* Journal daily: at night reflecting on the day that just ended; in the morning planning my day.
* Be mindful every moment.
* Pay special attention when interacting with people, be mindful.
* When the mind goes into a spiral down a rabbit hole; just stop.
* You can do it. Whether you think you can or you can't either way you're right.
* No gossips.
* No drama ever.",Stoicism,1704420924.0,t3_18yv8qn,0.85,12
A Life Direction through Determinism and Stoicism,"Some background: (skip if too long)

I'm 16, and lately I've been really struggling to do anything because of not knowing where I'm headed. It all began a few months ago. I was honestly really doing quite well, to which I mean I started being more responsible, disciplined and was focused on self-improvement. I slept and woke up early, took my studies seriously, did daily chores, etc.

I also journaled to write down my thoughts, which mostly consisted of how to improve myself and live better. On one of these journal sessions, I realized that my actions is mostly just problem solving. So I looked into how to problem solve. I read some stuff, and came to the conclusion that it simply boils down to: knowing WHAT to do, HOW to do that, and WHY do that. You might know where this is headed, but yeah, the ""WHY"" part really had me thinking. Why am I doing all this shit again? Why do I eat, sleep, study, have fun, and all the kit-and-caboodle?

So, naturally, I looked for an answer. If the question is ""why am I doing anything?"", then what I'm looking for is reason (or maybe purpose or meaning? idk I'm unsure still). I read about existentialism, absurdism, stoicism, and a few others, only enough to kinda get the gist of it, and I also did some personal thinking. This was where my mind has been for the past few months, and this lack of reason or direction or whatever, has really had me demotivated and depressed.

However, I think I've reached some sort of answer that I'm content with and I'd like to hear your thoughts about it.

&#x200B;

It goes as follows:

Determinism states that all actions and events result from other actions, events, or situations. The way I personally like to word this out is: ""what is"" determines ""what is to be"". ""What is"" simply refers to the state of stuff right now, and ""what is to be"" refers to how the state of how the stuff right now will be.

""What is"" includes me. What am I? What is the state of the stuff that is me right now? Well I am human. And a part of being human, of course, includes survival. But, it also includes the longing for happiness. And I personally think that the stoic philosophy of building character, having virtue as the goal, answers this longing for happiness.

What I'm essentially saying is: Stuff exists, and how these stuff exist, or ""what is"", determines how these stuff will exist, or ""what is to be"". A part of ""what is"" is what I am, and I am a human that longs for happiness among other things. This determines ""what is to be"", which includes my decisions and actions. Hence, I look for what'll bring me happiness, which I believe is found through the stoic philosophy.

(just to add, I recognize that determinism is usually brought up when discussing free will and responsibility, but here, I focus more on the idea it presents about how our actions is explicable by what we are and what other stuff are.)",Stoicism,1704420821.0,t3_18yv7e9,0.5,0
Does anyone else feel stressed when trying to apply Stoic teachings?,"It's not the teachings themselves that stress me out but rather the fact that Stoicism as a whole is a life guide and basically offers an answer for almost all scenarios.

It's so stressful to always think about what's right and what's wrong and hesitating a lot to indulge in good food or watching anything fun because these things don't contribute to my overall potential.

I'm aware it's considered a waste of time (which Stoics commanded people not to do) but I can't spend my entire time doing the right thing, especially if it doesn't give a feeling of peace or comfort.",Stoicism,1704416975.0,t3_18yttiw,0.72,7

I have trouble understanding this passage in the passage before this one, he is talking about all the relations in the world and the Constitution of the human mind to receive impressions in and that this must be the work of a God. Then he ends the passage with the following

> ""let them explain what it is that bring all of this about, or how it is possible that such wonders that bear all the signs of workmanship come into being by chance and of their own accord""

I cant really put the passage \[12\] into relation to the End  I just quoted above. If you all would not mind to share your thoughts on this passage, and maybe if you think  it is meant to add to the passage from before.

How to confront lies as a wise stoic? ( using what is within control and outside your control),"My freind and i made plans to buy somethings for her party. We already agreed on the day we were to go. The day before i message her askking her what part of the day she wants to go and she does not reply me, or pick my calls even if know shes always on her phone. I then call a freind she lives with, the freind gives her the phone and my freind admits that shes already bought the stuff and shes been busy all day and didnt have time to reply or even call back. 

I know shes lying. In one of the messages i sent her, asking when she wants to go to buy her stuff, she diverts and asks a different question. It seems she was avoiding telling me, and im left wondering why. It seems she would have never admited shew has bought the stuff if i didnt gi the extra mile by calling her freind.  I am wondering why she didnt tell me shes already bought the stuff already. I know shes lying and i refuse to give benefit of doubt.

shes very arguementative and may not admit the lie. Confronting her may ruin the freindship, especially with her birthday coming up, it may be awkward if i attend.

Do i play dumb and not confront or calmly express that i feel she is lying? then slowly just avoid believeing her or trusting her in future.

I  recently got to know that I am moving, and moving out from my current rental. Which I have had soon over a year. I am worrying constantly and anxious about the landlord fining me a lot of money for wear & tear.   


Is there any stoic advice that could perhaps help me?   


Just looking for a way to better myself and my mind. ",Stoicism,1704393725.0,t3_18ykeu0,0.67,2
How do I maintain Mindfulness when interacting with people?,"I've been practicing Stoicism for a couple of years now, and I do see some improvements.

These days I am tackling an issue that I have: when I interact with people I tend to ""forget"" to pay attention to the moment, to be Mindfull, and I react emotionally to most everything.

While I know this is not a Stoic matter, there's always a lot of useful advice here, Stoic advice.

So, how can I maintain my Mindfullness when interacting with other people?

Stoic Logic,"Recently I have started reading Stoic texts (Epictetus and Aurelius) more seriously. It is truly fascinating. However both do not offer much information on Stoic logic (aside from what I can deduce from the Stoic principles themselves although I can't claim to have understood those fully at all yet).

From what I understand Stoic logic was in some ways quite revolutionary and very distinct from some other ideas of the time (Aristotle being a prime example) and while no considerable body of work was preserved, what has been recorded is close to propositional logic which of course is very much in use in the modern age. Can anyone recommend a book, a course or another resource on Stoic logic? I could not find anything in the Wiki.",Stoicism,1704383751.0,t3_18ygdmo,0.9,8
How would stoicism treaty MY jealousy?,"I’m 18M in high school and I see posts on Reddit like “what’s the sexiest thing a partner has ever said during sex”, and “my boyfriend is so hot”, and “my girlfriend said the hottest thing to me during sex”. I see all the details, imagine it in my own head, and then become jealous. I’ll hear at school of other guys that get to hook up with a lot of pretty girls that I would have liked to talk to as well. And I become jealous. One of my friends even told me that the girl I like (who he and other people told me “is a whore”) would never go out with me or hook up with me because I am out of her league, and that she would only do that with guys “her level and above”. And I’ve become jealous of the guys that have gotten to do that. And my jealousy doesn’t lead me to hating them or doing bad things, but it does lead to me standing in front of the bathroom mirror pretending I’m Roberto Baggio missing the infamous penalty and looking all sad, which is not good either I guess. What would stoicism say? Please",Stoicism,1704350674.0,t3_18y6nni,0.38,0
I need your opinion - Marcus Aurelius was a common man?,"So recently I stumbled upon this YouTube channel that barely has any views. In one of their videos, they were saying that Marcus Aurelius was just a common man and not a mighty emperor.

In the video, they said ""Marcus Aurelius was a common man who knew a lot of people, that is why he is still relevant to this day"" 

I´m not sure if it's a language barrier for me and I have maybe misunderstood what they are saying but I think it's important to note that Marcus Aurelius was a powerful emperor yet he never fully bathed in that power or used it in any negative way.

"Anger, results and confusion","Ever been lied to? It's annoying, isn't it.

I feel like I've been lied to about a lot of things in my life. Most of them along the lines of ""Just do this and you'll be fine"". Well I did ""this"" and I wasn't fine. These were often people who had duty of care over me and I had little choice but to believe them and ironically were also the people who taught me that not telling the truth was a bad thing.

So deep down, I'm angry. At them for giving me instructions that lead nowhere, at me for being too weak or naive to get the results or to follow the instructions well enough.

If it weren't for that anger I would never have learned to stand up for myself when under attack, it has protected me. But in stoicism anger is never justified even if calmly explaining why someone hitting you should leave you alone is much less effective than striking back. I really don't get it.",Stoicism,1704369491.0,t3_18ybgvy,0.75,2
How to not judge people...,"How can I stop judging people?  
Just like today when test results came out and there were some people who got low scores despite the exams being easy (in my opinion). When I see their test results I just automatically judge them and think to myself that they probably dont do anything in their lifes but be on their phones all day and dont do anything to change or better themselves. 

I feel like just because I focus on self-improvement, I judge everyone else for not being the same as me, i have the same problems with other views in my life, like with atheism - i dont believe in any gods, and in my mind when i see someone fateful to god i just judge them about how theyre being stupid.

"best/modern French translation for Meditations/ ""Pensées""","Hi everyone, title says it all.

I'm about to finish reading Meditations (English translation by George W. Chrystal), so I want to next try my hand at the French translation. For a person learning French (slightly-higher-than intermediate level; I was certified level B2 I think a year or two ago), what modern or recent translation do you recommend? I also tried searching online (using ""meilleure traduction française pensées marc-aurèle"" and similar keywords), but the search results were vague and not as responsive as, say, when I tried searching for best English translations.

(I tried searching for a similar post, but while there are indeed some posts which have similarly requested for French translations, curiously, the responses have been deleted. Also, the FAQ only shows other English translations. But if I missed it, I do apologise and thank you in advance for pointing it out to me.)

I made an inappropriate joke to someone and their reply was hurtful. How do I subvert my expectations of being apologized to?,"This is a fake scenario based off of a real problem I'm having.

I'm confused in how to feel and how to respond to they way someone reacted to a joke I made.

So let's say I, Jack, made a joke about vegans to my friend Mark, who is not a vegan but has told me previously that they don't like jokes at the expense of vegans.

After telling my joke, Mark said ""shut up, that's offensive"".

Now, upon reflection I realized that I made a mistake. There's no doubt in my mind that the initial mistake was mine. However I still feel hurt due to being told to shut up.

I have apologized for making the joke, and Mark hasn't apologized for his response. I feel like I expect him to apologize. Should I not?

This is something which isn't yet clear to me in the stoic teachings. I lack ""the wisdom to know the difference"". I know his apology is out of my control, but should (or could) I tell him that it was hurtful and that I would like if he doesn't do it again?

Is the first step to forgiving someone that you perceived wronged you to control your thoughts or your actions?,"There is someone who in the past hurt me. A family member. For a while I was angry but eventually I let go of the anger and decided to just stop interacting with her. I would be short and blunt with her and would not attend events that she would be at. The largest part of my anger was that she never apologized to me. 

I realize now that she did not injure me in anyway. The things she said that were true I had no right to be upset about and the things that were false equally were unimportant. 

I am able to now interact with her and be pleasant as if I harbour no negative emotions. I act with her as I think I would if nothing had happened. 

However when interacting with her I feel a negative emotion. Sometimes the remains of anger and sometimes some sort of sadness towards how I was treated. 

I feel as though these are not passions since I am not allowing them to affect the way I act but they do seem to affect my thoughts. It’s something I’ve been struggling with for months. I’m not sure how to approach it further. 

In my mind I rationally know that what happened was not something I could control but the way I think about it is however the emotions still occur whenever I see her.

Shaving your beard,"Please excuse the paraphrasing, I do not have my copy with me.

Epictetus says that if one is to practice philosophy, their conviction should be such that they are willing to lose their head if another demands they behave in a manner contrary to their philosophy. This is conveyed early on in the discourses in a metaphor about shaving one's beard.

He also says that one should not try to pursue causes that are out of one's control, because not only will one disgrace themselves in doing this, they will have abandoned a pursuit in which they could have performed well. This is from enchiridion 37.

A topical example is a hypothetical US citizen that believes that US aid to Israel is cruel. This citizen decides to not pay their taxes, in accordance with their philosophy. But then they are jailed, preventing them from the good they could have done while not jailed, and Israel still receives the aid because there are hundreds of millions of tax paying citizens. 

Quote 2 implies it is a better idea to just follow the law and pay the taxes. Quote 1 implies that we should not care for the consequences.

Am I misunderstanding? Is there a discourses chapter that elaborates on enchiridion 37?

Thanks.",Stoicism,1704248153.0,t3_18x7ore,0.64,4
Bushido and Stoicism,"I’ve seen here several people mention how stoicism has similarities to some eastern philosophies. Before I discovered stoicism for myself, I studied the samurai. I wanted to know why they were portrayed as calm people in media and culture. This is one of my favorite quotes and I believe it fits the stoic goal of calmness. Perhaps even fear of death. This comes from Inazo Nitobe (1862-1933). He was born into the samurai class, but was 6 when it was abolished. His book, “The Way of the Samurai” is one of two books that most influences samurai media. That and the Hagakure. 

“The Way of the Samurai” Chapter 4: Courage, the Spirit of Daring and Bearing

“The spiritual aspect of valor, is evidenced by composure - calm presence of mind. Tranquility is courage in repose. It is a statical manifestation of valor, as daring deeds are dynamical. A truly brave man is ever serene; he is never taken by surprise; nothing ruffles the equanimity of his spirit. In the heat of battle he remains cool; in the midst of catastrophes, he keeps level his mind. Earthquakes do not shake him, he laughs at storms. We admire him as truly great, who, in the menacing presence of danger, or death, retains his self possession; who, for instance, can compose a poem under impending peril, or hum a strain in the face of death. Such indulgence betraying no tremor in the writing, or in the voice, is taken as an infallible index of a large nature - what we call a capacious mind, which, far from being pressed or crowded, has always room for something more”

I need help,"I’ve put a previous entry into this group and found it helpful, however I’m still struggling and just have lost the spark for life.

Previous message included how I got an oppurtunity of a lifetime to pursue my masters in physiotherapy but it came crashing down when I became what I now understand to be a mixture of depression and anxiety.

I’m trying my best to build up some gratitude towards the small things but I can’t help but feel like a massive failure who at 25 has returned home after an oppurtunity of a lifetime and now has to work even harder to get back to the oppurtunity given.

I’m just not sure what to do anymore and find myself feeling more and more lost as time goes on.  Constantly overthinking that when I do go back this same situation will be waiting for me again.

Roommate situation,"So I recently had a conversation with my roommate about the importance of putting organic trash in the organic bin instead of the garbage bin. Unfortunately, it didn't go as smoothly as I had hoped. My roommate responded with a passive-aggressive attitude, claiming that he wasn't the one primarily responsible for this issue and that he was, in fact, the one who took out the trash the most.  He then went on to indirectly accuse me of not putting dishes in the dishwasher and leaving them in the sink for an extended period.

In order to be a good and just person should we correct lies we have told or bad actions we have done even if they will hurt the person?,"In an attempt to be a better person I am trying to right things I have done in the past and be an honest person in general. 

For example, in a joint business in the past I was under reporting revenue and over reporting expenses in order to pocket more of the profit. To right this wrong I have a cheque written for the difference to give to my partner. My question now arises in if I should tell him that I was stealing from him all this time. 

As I am someone he trusts immensely this would upset him and I am doing it to make myself feel better. 

I could alternatively lie and say ""I found some mistakes in the numbers, looks like you're owed this much more"". 

Is lying to make him feel better a stoic action?

I've analyzed this situation and I am not scared to tell him that I betrayed his trust. I am able to accept any fall out from it. I would obviously prefer to have him in my life as I consider him a friend but that is a decision I think he should make, not me. 

I feel as though I am starting to ramble now so I will stop shortly. 

I compared the situation to if I was told by a recent ex she was cheating on me the entire relationship. I would feel upset over that and think that it was unnecessary to tell me this additional information after we had broken up. 

The business is still running and I stopped playing with the numbers recently. 


This also made me wonder if we should go out of our way to correct any lies or misinformation we have given people or to just be honest going forward.

What things are determine what things do. Is this true? What does stoicism have say to this?,"Here's the gist:

* Wise 16 year old gains consciousness 
* Doesn't know why he does what he does.
* Wonders ""what am I doing?"" and ""why am I doing it?
* What SHOULD I do and why SHOULD I do that?
* Wants a clear life direction.
* Tries to figure it out for months.
* Can't figure it out. Isn't satisfied with any answer. Finds despair instead.
* Has trouble doing anything cause of not knowing why he does what he does, or for that matter, why does ANYTHING at all do what they do?
* Reaches some sort of conclusion, which he still doesn't find satisfying so then asks reddit cause doesn't know where else.

The conclusion:

- Things just exists.
- These things exist in certain ways.
- The ways that these things exist can change.

This is reality.


What things are determine what things do, and what things do determine what things are to be.

ie. What a thing is and what surrounds that thing (the universe/ the earth/ society) determines what it does, and what it does determines what it becomes and what surrounds it becomes. 


If this is true, then:

What to do?
What you do is determined by what you are and what other things are.

Why do that?
What is done is done because of what you are and what other things are.

Contradictory quotes?,"Dear Posse.

Does ugliness rub off?  Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius seem to disagree, or can Marcus Aurelius’ words be interpreted into “ugliness will only rub off, if you let it”?

Epictetus, Enchiridion 33.6

And 

“When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they can't tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are unnatural.”

How to maintain relationship with parents while keeping my peace?,"Sorry, it might feel like a rant, but I don't know how to summarize what goes in my mind.

I ooz hate/anger in my head when I speak to my parents when they ask me to do things certain way. I usually listen for one or two times, and then in straight words, I tell them that I dont want to live that particular way  but if they want to, then it is their choice. My father  just switches the topic or hands over the phone to my mom. One time, when I recommended something then my mom said that she would listen from one ear and let it out from other. 

Part of me doesn't want to have any relationship with them, and the other part is like that they are growing old and live thousands of kilometers away.

2yrs ago, I stopped sharing my life with them over our daily calls unless it impacts them in some way. I really dont say much. I just listen to what they have to say about their life and leave it at it. This is out of respect what they have gone through to support me in whatever way, and I know they didnt have it easy.

However, I can't deny I question my choice to call them every single day because for them it doesn't matter as it's part of living life and I overthink. After all this, they try to associate with me, and I have noticed myself being instantly repellant to that association as I don't want to be like my parents.

\-*Darth Plagueis*, James Luceno

Yeah i know star wars is silly, but these quotes are the kind of thing that make me question some stoic principles.

Marcus Aurelius wrote to himself ""If it is endurable, then endure it. Stop complaining."" but isn't complaining a natural human response to stress? An stoic can even fool himself thinking that he can endure everything ""endurable"" only to snap like a brittle twig at some point.

Isn't having hope and goals two of the most powerful driving forces in humans? Yet stoicism says hope is the twin brother of fear. And even fear can keep living beings alive, same with anger and stubbornness.

Trouble with knowing which emotions are reasonable,"First: I mention some heavy thoughts, but I am in no active danger, so please don’t report this. I am in therapy, but I also want some logical input, because rationalising thoughts helps me. Thank you. 
 ———

To make it brief - I know that the right mindset can change *a lot*. That is what I struggle with the most, right after controlling my emotions (as in, not letting them control me). 


I am in therapy and have also started recently mood stabilisers, as my psych thinks the intensity of my emotions is not normal. But obviously I still need to work in therapy on actively calming myself and changing my mindset. I’m doing CBT which overlaps a lot with Stoicism. 


So:  I’ve struggled hard with guilt, shame, and as a result suicidal ideation for years. I often want to open up to my family about it, but I’ve been told even just breaking into tears over small disagreements is me being “manipulative”.  No words can convince my father otherwise, not even from my therapist. So just the idea of being vulnerable to my father (who has plenty reasons to be disappointed by and angry with me, as he is) and telling him “I don’t want to be alive anymore. And I feel guilty that I know I won’t ever attempt suicide because I believe it would be better for you. But I am too selfish even for that.” is terrifying. Not to be able to tell your own parent you wish to stop living, because you are used to negative responses to opening up, is so painful and invalidating. I don’t want pity from him, I want empathy and to feel loved. My suicidal ideation is real, and I need help. But it doesn’t go away from one therapy session, and I think beging honest about how you feel is important for well being. So not being able to be honest with my own father is… I am repeating myself. 


But is it “reasonable” or “okay” to feel sad that I can’t tell own father how I feel? Can I tell him anyway because it weighs so heavily on me, or should I keep it between myself and my therapist? Because isn’t the **reason** I’m sad that I care what he thinks? Is it “reasonable” in Stoicism that I want to trust and be loved by my parent, to want empathy from him? Or should I work on not caring what he thinks, because then, well, then I won’t let myself be controlled by my wish to get love from him? 


I am at a loss. To not care what my own father thinks of me seems so so cold and irresponsible. I am scared that if I don’t care what he thinks of me, I will might behave in ways that hurt him. 


But then, if he feels hurt, wouldn’t that be his responsibility and because of his mindset? 
But that sounds even colder. 


I don’t know what to think. I just want to be happy, and the man who said I need to ask for help more doesn’t understand that the best way for *him* to help me is to be empathetic.",Stoicism,1704150312.0,t3_18w9k4u,0.84,9

Hello everyone. Needed some information and guidance from fellow stoicists. Would mean a lot to me.,"It's gonna be pretty unorganised so please bear with me.

My first point of concern is if I am doing something wrong or harming myself in any way by studying and applying stoicism?? That's my biggest concern right now. I am reading stoicism a lot and it has brought to me a lot of changes. I need to know if I am setting myself up for some bad outcome.

Here's some changes that I have observed after starting stoicism.

1. I have stopped getting post jut clarity. I know it sounds silly but it's a major concern for me. I used to have post nut clarity for when I used to feel low or needed to clear my mind. Now I can't. But I do get some resemblance of post nut clarity when I am reading stoicism. So I don't really know if that's a good thing or bad thing.


2. I have become way better in making friends. Earlier I used to have trouble getting respect from people now I am doing good not as much as I would like but far better than earlier. But I think I have lost my charming capabilities too. Earlier I could enjoy parties and be fun there too. Now I just dont see any point in parties. Everytime I see someone enjoying parties and getting out of control, I start judging them which is a wrong thing.


3. My other concern is that girls don't follow stoicism and it makes me prone to getting cheated on. Somehow I can't shake the feeling that getting complacent and indifferent leads to your partner getting a free hand and cheating on you.


4. I would really appreciate a mentor who has been actively practicing stoicism for a long time now.

People thinking I don't care,"Happy New Year all,

In practicing emotional control and not immediately reacting to a negative situation, has anyone else run into other people thinking you don't care?

Take for example, if a significant issue or mistake occured at work, I used to overreact to show coworkers and management how much I cared, but I eventually realized this caused me too much mental distress, and was not worth it in the grand scheme of life, it's just a job.

Since becoming a practicing stoic, I am getting the impression from others that my calm/indifferent reaction to situations makes them think I don't care, which is an issue concerning I am in management. 

Has anyone else run into this? My thought is my mental well being is more of a priority than what some boss might think of my level of engagement, and that an employer having an issue with your calmness probably isn't one to stay with.

The Praxis of Developing a Stoic Mindset - How can we actually start to think and behave Stoically? Here are my thoughts on concrete steps to take to begin moving towards the Stoic ideal.,"# Introduction

It's not secret that as this subreddit has grown, a large number of the topics are people seeking Stoic advice. A lot of these posts are however misguided in a way - they seem to be  looking for a particular kind of solution that you might find in an algebra problem. They want something that they can plug into the equation to solve for X, and thus find a neat and tidy answer to their problem - whether that's a broken heart, the effects of childhood trauma, or disappointment at their lack of self-perceived accomplishment in their lives. Stoicism is not a framework for solving for a particular value of X. It is rather a way of deconstructing the problem such that you realize looking for X is the wrong approach entirely. 

The suffering that people describe as stemming from various events (my romantic partner left me, I feel empty and defeated) is the categorical mistake that Stoicism seeks to address. It is a radical and revolutionary reframing of the human experience that begins with the detachment of human value judgment from the events and consequences that are happening every second of our lives. In simple terms, Stoicism would say that the breaking of your relationship is not the source of your suffering, but your impression of it is. If you broke off an abusive relationship and were now freed from violence and oppression, you would see the end of a relationship as liberation. It is your impression and interpretation of the event which creates the condition of pleasure/pain in your mind. And so Stoicism stretches that to almost every single thing that we experience, and demands that we detach from judging things to be good or bad so that we are not living our lives at the mercy of chance and fortune. Virtue is the sole good, and our virtue can never be affected by anything that happens to us, including physical pain, destitution or death. This is of course simplistic, but I wanted to set the stage with a broad overview before getting to the point of this post, which is:

# **How do I *actually* start thinking and acting Stoically?**

**The first step in developing a Stoic mindset is to develop the habit of having structured reflection about yourself and your life.** This means not only thinking about what you are doing and how you are living, but taking active steps such as journalling, and structured review of your thoughts/actions which you revisit later on. The process of putting thoughts into writing forces you to order them and clarify them. Pure mental thinking is ultra-high bandwidth with tons of noise and emotional baggage that cloud the ideas, whereas writing is a kind of structured thinking that forces you to crystallize your innumerable thoughts, and serves as a record for your future self. Its hard to remember what you were thinking about even a week ago, and it's imperative to have a handle on the evolution of your thinking and feeling. 

So if you are at a loss at where to start, start writing daily. Write about your life and your thoughts every single day. What is happening and what is your judgment of what is happening? What do you want? What do you feel is missing? Alongside this, pick a Stoic text and begin reading it. Don't worry about commentary, just read it for yourself first. Slowly, you will see themes from Stoic texts crop up in your life. Reflect on them - are they applicable? Do you agree with the author? Do you find the ideas persuasive or do you disagree with them? Explain yourself and your thinking. Later on, return to your writing and see if your mind is changing. You will be shocked at what you wrote 1 month ago, 6 months ago, etc. It will be a sign of your progress, and this is critical because Stoicism is a journey of self-mastery, and of self-responsibility. It is imperative you keep a written record. 

# **I'm already reading and journalling - what now?**

Our goal is of course to begin changing our minds, and that means achieving some kind of control over our reactions in real-time. In my view, the critical step is looking to carve a space between **action** and **reaction** in the course of our lives. At first, there is no space - we can only reflect on things hours or days afterwards. But as we continue the process of reflection and meditation, it finally happens - we get a brief flash of space between an event and our impression of it. An example from my own life might look like this:

> *Here is a typically angering situation for me. I can see it unfolding. This is a huge inconvenience to me. This person is completely disrespecting me and my time. I feel my blood pressure rising and my emotions lifting. I want to show my anger to this person, but I know I will regret it later. *

And I would still react angrily. I would say something disrespectful back, raise my voice, and lose control of myself. But still - I had time enough to have the above discourse in my mind. I could recognize it all happening, and I still couldn't control it, **but this is the first victory.** I could see the impression forming. And so then you reflect on the fact that you are starting to see the impression forming, you write about it in your journal. And then it happens again. And again. And you fail again. But then one time you catch yourself and actually manage to shift your reaction a tiny bit. You curb your anger. You take a few breaths and instil calmness into the situation. You are still angry but you're doing better this time. It takes less time for you to cool off after. And afterwards when you journal, you realize that this is the first time you've ever been able to stop yourself before fully engaging in the emotional reaction.

We see posts like these on here as well ""Stoic success stories"" - small but important anecdotes where people relay a situation where they caught themselves about to react badly, and asserted control. These victories stem from the earlier step of creating that tiny space.

As you continue to pile up these 'victories', you assert more and more control over your reactions. In your reflections, you begin to truly understand that when people are being rude or disrespectful to you, it is a reflection of their own hardships and ignorance, and nothing to do with you. You start to truly understand that getting angry is handing ownership of your mind to another, usually a complete stranger, who has already forgotten about you while you are still brewing with rage from your interaction with them. And so it becomes more and more natural to simply not react in these situations. 

# The key is to keep it in mind

The general theme here is that in order to begin to think Stoically, you need REMINDERS to do so. You need some kind of process that injects the Stoic principles back into the active thinking patterns and not just the passive ones that are occurring in times of acute pain. I think for most people, that has to begin with active, regular journalling and reading the Stoic texts. The more you think and write on them, the more they will be in your mind. And the more they are in your mind, the faster you will finally achieve that first 0.01 seconds of space between action and reaction, and then that space will continue to get bigger as you gain control over your emotions and cognition. As you gain control, you start to actually see the process almost from a third person perspective. This creates the conditions for further control, for more space, and the process continues and you can sink deeper into the true Stoic mindset.

As you go further, you are not simply getting better at calming down - you are starting to see the events for what they are, and they lose the ability to affect you in the first place. You actually begin to understand implicitly, not just logically, the foundational truth of the Stoic mindset. The logical understanding of Stoic ideas is not enough - 99.9% of you understand them already, but that doesn't magically change your mind. You need repetitions and practice so that your brain grasps it on an emotional level as well. Over time, you are seeing the problem differently - there is no X to solve.",Stoicism,1704132452.0,t3_18w2gxi,0.95,62

Re-reading Epictetus. General tips?,"Cyberstoa:

I read Epictetus once months ago.  I don’t seem to have gotten much out of it.  There was lots going on in my life, so it could have been for a number of reasons.

It appears, however, that Stoicism is a philosophy/practice that might help me live a “better” life.  I keep being told on this sub that to understand Stoicism I need to at least start with understanding Epictetus.

To that end, I will begin re-reading it.  Something like a chapter a day.

*Is there any general advice I could keep in mind as I embark on this exploration?*

- if you struggled to get much out of it on your fist read and were able to get much more on your second, your advice would be particularly useful to me

On discussing other people,"An excerpt from Simplicius’ commentary on *Enchiridion* 33 follows this chunk:

> But above all things take care not to talk of other People, neither so as to censure their Conduct, nor to be lavish in their Commendation, nor to make invidious Comparisons between one and another.

The commentary: 

> But above all things, he gives us warning not to entertain our selves, and our Company with talking of other People; neither so as to call their Behaviour to Account, nor to be profuse in their Praises, nor free in making Comparisons between one Man and another, as That this Lady is handsomer than That, or this Man Braver, or Honester than That, or the like. Now there is nothing more evident, than that this Topick does in a more than ordinary manner divert the Soul from its self, and its own Business; for it makes Men busie, and curious, and impertinent, extreamly inquisitive, and troublesome where they have nothing to do. But why should this (you'll say) do so more than any other? And what can our talking of other Men have in it worse than the Subjects mentioned before?

> To this we may reply, That the Person to whom the Advice is here directed, being one who hath made some progress in Philosophy, as not so likely to entertain himself with those trivial Matters, as with something that relates to Mankind, and their Affairs and Actions. So that it was convenient to draw him off from those things especially, which his own Inclina∣nations would most dispose him to; and there∣fore he adds that Emphatical Caution, But above all things.

> Besides, though it be true, That the same Affections are stirred in us by both Discourses a∣like, (for we are insensibly drawn in to love and hate things and Men by talking of them) yet there is one peculiar Vice attends our Conver∣sation, when we pretend to give Characters of other people; which is, That it strangely swells one with Vanity and Pride, and Contempt of others. For whoever he be that pretends to sit in Judgment upon other Mens Conduct, does it out of some imagined Excellence in himself, which he fansies gives him a Right to arraign his Neighbours. And besides, any mistake in our Judgments of Men, is more inexcusable, and of infinitely worse Consequenee than if we pro∣nounce wrong in those other trifling Matters; and therefore we should be very sparing and tender in this Point.

Holiday's Influence,"Just thought I'd mention this since I've been seeing some posts about ryan holiday. 

I've seen Stoics here mentioned that despite the twisted and misconstrued picture holiday paints about Stoicism, many people end up finding true Stoicism. Therefore, holiday may not be doing too much harm, but rather a benefit to people. 

I'd like to challenge that by telling my experience. 

I first heard of Stoicism in college, around 2016. I don't recall if it was on a podcast or a YouTube video or an article, but I came across holiday talking about the Meditations and Marcus Aurelius and Stoicism. 

And when I heard him, I easily saw he was just talking bullshit. And I completely disregarded Stoicism too. 

Fast forward, I graduated and got a job in finance in 2018. And one day while at a colleagues desk, I noticed he had the Meditations of Aurelius. This seemed to me to be a confirmation of what holiday was selling: Stoicism as some broski, hustle, self help bullshit that would be big with finance bros (like my colleague).

Of course I was wrong to associate Marcus Aurelius and Stoicism with holiday's bullshit. It wasn't until this year that I really got into Stoicism. And in all of those years, I didn't give Stoicism a chance because I (erroneously) associated Stoicism with bullshit self help. 

To be fair to me though, (and my point), holiday, in my experience, did not only not lead me to Stoicism, but also contributed to the impression that Stoicism was just a bunch of hustle culture self help bullshit. 

I could only speculate how better my life would have been had I given Stoicism a chance and read the Discourses. But that's futile. 

So just as holiday might help bring people to Stoicism, he might also help people push Stoicism away. And so, in this way, holiday might not be helping people. 

What's left for us is to simply guide people away from holiday and redirect them to Stoicism.",Stoicism,1704097173.0,t3_18vsd29,0.67,5
Stoic values and Career,"I recently began reading a translation of Epictetus’ works. In one part of it, he says it is better to be poor and starve to death in tranquility than to live anxiously in abundance. He also says “you can always win competitions in which winning is up to you”.

Now I have recently decided to take a big leap in my career by giving an extremely difficult exam and move abroad. My reasons are that I will be at the top of my career (and very good at my job) with a significant improvement in pay and a better work life balance. My reason for leaving my country is bad work culture & toxicity, being undervalued, bad working hours. The whole process of moving abroad is extremely difficult and taxing. Reading the above stoic advice has got me confused because this goes directly against it.

I really do want to achieve things and be pretty good at my job. Pay is secondary. However, I do value a good work life balance. Should I adopt these stoic values and change my mind about this huge step I am going to take? Is there any other view this? Please help.",Stoicism,1704095224.0,t3_18vrwl1,0.67,2

Reflecting on Ryan,"I was blown away when someone on this subreddit pointed out to me that Ryan Holiday's debasement of this philosophy has reached the point of him creating a site called ""[The Wealthy Stoic](https://www.thewealthystoic.com/)"" to openly shill Stoicism as a get-rich-quick scheme.

For years I have been telling people his approach is a poorly disguised get-rich-quick scheme. What he's done has taken all of the cleverness out of that observation - now anyone with eyes can make that observation, which makes me feel a lot less original (and that could be a good thing).

It doesn't anger me when I look at the ""Wealthy Stoic""; the feeling is more like bemusement. Stoicism is exactly the opposite of what he's selling - it's just remarkable that he's chosen such a staunchly ascetic philosophy as his basis for selling people their own greed back to them. Perhaps wrapping one thing up in the other somehow makes the grift more effective.

As the new year rolls in and I start moving towards my fifth year of Stoic practice, it's somewhat interesting to reflect on the fact that feeling as though Ryan Holiday was trying to scam me is what initially sent me to Epictetus, and learning from Epictetus is what unlocked the benefits of the philosophy for me. I had just started recovering from my drug addiction, and I was reading The Daily Stoic and another one of his books (possibly ""The Obstacle is the Way"" but I cannot quite recall). As I read I got the distinct sense that I was reading trite garbage attached to a sales funnel by a person who didn't *really* care for their subject matter, and who was disturbingly enamored with extremely wealthy people who had diddly-squick to do with Stoic philosophy. Feeling certain there must be more value to the philosophy than what I was being given, I googled something like ""who is the most respected Stoic"" and was directed to Epictetus. I purchased my Penguin Classics copy of the Discourses (Kindle edition of course - I wanted to start immediately) and I never looked back.

I can recall an overwhelming sense of joy and relief when I realized that not only was the philosophy far from the trite, vague nonsense Holiday was portraying it as, but I was reading one of the most profound forms of thought I'd ever seen written down - a distillation of all the wisdom I'd acquired in beating my addiction, plus a cognitive mountain of completely verifiable and entirely unique claims about the mind that I'd never have been able to come up with on my own, and which I now use every single day when reasoning about how to live my life. 

I live an honest life. I feel happy - I feel like I never lack courage and that I do not need to lie to anyone. I have a wife I love and I'm content with what I have - truly content, as in if I had my current circumstance for the rest of my life I'd die happy. Better yet, if every single object I owned were lost in some freak accident tomorrow, I'm fairly sure I'd be no less content - I might need a week to get my bearings, I'm far from a Stoic sage after all, but I doubt I'd need much more than that. 

It's strange to feel that way, and to have felt such a profound benefit from the practice of this philosophy, only to then see the person I once thought of as its titan looking haggard and exhausted, shilling get-rich-quick schemes on a scammy-looking website. It drives home a point the Stoics make themselves - that the wealth and power of the Emperor counts for nothing. To Ryan Holiday, Stoic philosophy is nothing but a way to grift - like any criminal, he makes his money robbing the unaware and scamming the credulous. To me, the philosophy taught me how to be happy. When I help people to understand Stoicism I don't do it for money, and I get to feel honest at the end of it, something I suspect Ryan Holiday hasn't felt about himself in a very long time.

Isn't it more productive to instead concentrate on what our responsibilities are? That's a much easier question to answer. What is your responsibility and what isn't your responsibility? Are you properly accepting responsibility for the things you say and do? 

Some things are our responsibility and some things aren't. Trying to accept responsibility for the actions and reactions of others does a disservice to them as maybe they're supposed to be learning a lesson. Trying to make someone else responsible for my actions and reactions does me a disservice because it removes my opportunities to learn and grow. 

For example if I had a child, to say I'm in control of the child would be not very correct. But I'm definitely responsible for the safety of the child as far as I'm able. I can't control the safety of anyone 100 percent.

Today I went from being right to being wrong. So much for my Stoicism practice.,"Today I was wronged. Someone did something.

I remedied, took matters into my own hands, and with effort and work, I remedied someone's malice or stupidity (Occam's razor).

Stoicism teaches us: 

* I did well. I used wisdom, courage, and justice.
* Now move on, continue to practice virtues, and - why not - do great things with your life.
* It's all done and over with.

But I had to confront that person, ask them why they did what they did. They lied and turned things around, accusing me of not telling the truth. So not only they wrong edme, but now they were trying to do the switcharoo on me? And falsely accusing me?

I tried to reason with them, nope, there was no way. I distanced myself and I reported to their company.  Then, later on, on my way out, I picked up the conversation again, which continued on the same note; till I lost my temper.

So, from being on the right side of the fact I become the villain. I was, the a-hole.

And this is where Stoicism is correct:

* What had happened (when the person wronged me) was outside my control.
* I was able to control some actions that I took to remedy.
* The entire event, now in the past, is 100% outside my control. There's nothing that I can do to undo what was done. Stoicism teaches me to do nothing, because there's nothing to be done. That is the wise thing to (not) do, that is the just thing do to, that would be a manifestation of moderation.

The actions that I took instead, the things I said, the letting my anger take over losing my cool were my doing, I did that, I allowed that, I went into the rabbit hole and continued to go down.

And now I can't sleep (ruminating) and I have been re-living those events for the past few hours. What a waste of life.

Now more than ever I see how the Stoic teaching are correct, always seek to be virtuos, by practicing wisdom, justice, courage, and moderation.

And by distinguishing what is within our control and what is not; and act accordingly.

And to be aware of impressions, since:

> We form our judgments and opinions based on what the Stoics called “impressions.” In broad terms, all stimuli (and our unthinking interpretations of them) are impressions.

Today was an opportunity for me to practice Stoicism at its best. If I had done that it would have been very low effort, just ""doing nothing"" really. I could have moved on with my life, doing something productive in the past few hours, and by now I would be sleeping like a baby.

I have come a long way thanks to therapy and also Stoicim, but I now realize that a part of me is still deeply angry inside.  Dear stoa, what are my lessons to learn here, and how can I avoid this in the future?

Thanks in advance.",Stoicism,1703973764.0,t3_18ur1o0,0.7,8
Why do we instinctively avoid death?,"Stoicism defends that there is no evil in death. However, our insticts makes us avoid death at all costs. We have mental mechanisms to allow us to escape dangerous situations and etc. Assuming there is no evil in death, why do our biology needs to avoid it at all costs? It looks to me as if body and mind may not be on the same page about death.

How to think when some people are facing hard times (& unfortunate incidents) while you are relatively well off?,"(post is convoluted and might not be comprehensble, I don't know how to express my feelings. )


two incidents made me this ask the question. seeing homeless person and another who is suffering from toxic relationship.

whenever I see homeless person, I feel terrible and physical unease. I usually see on shopping street or when I come out from eating at restaurant, which means I also feel guilty for spending money. (but you can't live without doing that) I don't spend on unnecessary things and don't eat at fancy places, I am still a college student and don't eat out often and most expensive meal I had on my own is $12 and that too twice or thrice a year.  But when I eat I usually see homeless person as I walk home from that place. I donate change I have but still I feel almost depressed. q's like Do I deserve the nice food I just had? why is that person suffering in cold outside but I go to nice, warm house? 


I am aware of very close person I know who suffered domestic abuse and had their life turned upside down, their religious family recognize the abuse but don't want them to divorce. 

after becoming aware of such things I become sad and it feels bad to do things I do and indulge in which are not necessary but essential to get on with my life. (like putting on nice fragrance when going to job interview, while hearing someone I know crying because of abusive relationship feels .... ) 

the essence of Stoicism dictomy of control. 
 these are the things i don't have control over, so focus on things I have control over. but feels odd to engage in some things while you see suffering.",Stoicism,1703964857.0,t3_18unmvd,0.63,2
Making a fool of myself drunk,"Hello guys! I have a problem. I often binge drink when I go outside. Week ago I was at a concert and I made a complete fool of myself. I was flaling down, flerting with many guys, kissed one qho has really bad reputation. I was looking horrible. Problem is that I knew all of the people there and now I am really embarrassed because of it all. I oftent drink that much because of a social anxiety. I can't focus so much on other things when I am alone, it has been a week and I still feel like shit. I am old enough (33) that I don't wanna do this things no more. But it just happens. I often think about quitting alcohol. But I don't know if I can do it for a longer period of time. I pretty much have good things in my life going on. Good job, great close friends, I am healthy, but this is the thing that I cannot stop. I am a great person when I don't drink. I am acting horrible sometimes when I do. For this one I feel ashamed so much. Do you have any experience with this? How did you overcome this kind of things? Any helpful thoughts. 
Maybe this is not the right place to ask this, but I would love to hear your thoughts about this. ",Stoicism,1703962110.0,t3_18umkbe,0.77,24
Notes on Surmounting Daily Tensions,"A private note from myself to myself about having proportionate reactions to things and not causing myself unnecessary suffering. 
These thoughts have helped me over the past 3 years and might be helpful to others. I am not a writer and these rough notes I don't generally share. If this is nonsense or otherwise unwanted, tell me. I'll remove it and be gone.


This is not a test. This is the real thing.

When your 40 minute drive becomes two hours or your spouse uses more plates and forks than they need and it's your turn to do the dishes or a non-human animal under your care needs to shit some time around 4 am and you always prefer it be outside of the house so you wake up your brain, raise your body temperature a bit and go outside, sometimes you find yourself contorted.
All tied up in a knot for the duration of the bad thing. You're annoyed or angry. You wish to be in a different mental state.

Ask yourself:

Is this not life? In these moments when my (probably not deeply thought out) immediate preferences aren't met, can I not be satisfied? Can I only be satisfied if what I think I want is what I get? No. That seems like asking for trouble. Pre-meditated suffering. 
If I can learn to enjoy traffic then I'll always be satisfied.

My goal is to go from 
""oh, no. There is heavy traffic. My will and desires have been thwarted by circumstance. I will now lament what I cannot have"" 
to 
""I see that there is heavy traffic. I know that this is always possible. It only means that it will take more time to put my body where I want it to be. Good thing I am protected from the elements, robbers and great distances in my private metal box. It's not what I wanted, but these moments are also my life. I will not spend them lamenting or wanting anything other than what I get. At that point, it's too late to get otherwise. Accept the consequences at once so you can relax your breathing, straighten out your spine and focus on finding pleasure or contentness in the places you're not paying attention to. If you don't accept it, the consequences will still happen. You'll just be miserable and it'll be your own fault""",Stoicism,1703961546.0,t3_18umci1,0.75,7
How come one stay Optimistic whilst pracising Stoicism or Premeditatio Malorum?,"Although I do not study Stoicism as often as before because of responsibilities and emotional decline, my knowledge of Stoicism has started to drift off I think and I'm confused about certain things.

I have been practicing negative visualization quite regularly for 5 months, I have noticed it may help me sometimes go on with with my tasks accepting the consequences, but as a side effect negatively affect my mindset and expectations and other times completely paralyzes my expectations and impressions of the matter.

"Dealing with sexual frustration, loneliness and weak social skills","Hi all,

I'm a male 28 working as a software engineer. Career wise I'm in a good position and learning everything day by day. But however I found out that I'm quite lonely and doesn't have any plans for new year whereas my friends have plans with their wives and girlfriends. Also lately I have been sexually frustrated and all I do is masturbate when I'm all alone. I am having hard time accepting I have terrible social skills and can't get girls even though I'm a good looking guy. I have been going to gym and improved my physique. But it didn't gave me much confidence. How can I deal with these things and move on. I really want to improve myself. But I feel like I don't have the patience to go through lot of rejection.

How do I control my frustration towards others?,"Recently I’ve felt like I’ve been getting angry or frustrated over the smallest things, including statements from my parents. I’ve tried to calm my emotions, meditation and other techniques but I end up either yelling or getting unnecessarily angry at them due to miscommunication and not being on the same page. 

A recent example of this is my mum nagging me on getting a job (it has been a year since I’ve been unemployed) however during the start of the year she stopped me from getting/applying to new jobs due to my studies and exams. Now in these couple of weeks she’s  been complaining why I wasn’t working throughout the year, saying that, after being unemployed I “gave up” and was “too lazy”to find a job to her friends on the phone. In addition, she also complains/yells that the reason of no jobs accepting me was due to my appearance?!?! That it was because of my moustache and bleached blonde tips (note I am Asian, and she dislikes how I do not look like the stereotypical southeast Asian). Moreover, she sometimes doesn’t realise I’m trying my best, yes I agree I can be lazy and impractical, but they always disregard on what I Do and focus on what I Don’t (not sure if that made sense haha)Like I’ve been really trying my hardest to find a job. This lead me to lashing out and having an argument about it, and yet in the end nothing was understood between us on what we were trying to state, and she ended up pushing it off and blaming herself, that “it’s all her fault”. The same scenario has occurred with just different topics and statements ending in her blaming herself for being a bad mum.

This always made me feel bad, every time I’ve had an argument with my family members I always reflect on what I said and what I should’ve done instead of what I did with my actions, hoping that next time I’m met with this situation I can stop it from getting any worse. 

And I always remember that it is also their first times at living life and that they are also trying to figure their own lives out. With this I really do love my mum and I know she wants the best for me, I never want to see her sad or feel like a failure, she has gone through a lot of struggles and done so much for me, but sometimes our misunderstanding and miscommunication gets under my skin which leads to my outbursts of frustration towards them. 

But I hope that next time I’m able to calm myself in these scenarios so that we are able to communicate better, to be in the same page.

Any tips, techniques, books can help me out would be appreciated!!!

Thank you for listening to my TED Talk haha

"""Isn't the foolishness of a few a more precious commodity than the wisdom of the masses?""-Fate Zero","Gilgamesh: I am fond of lives of hubris. People who harbor grand ambitions without realizing that they are unequal to the task. The mere sight of such people gives me great enjoyment. There are two kinds of arrogance. One where you are unequal to the task and one where your dreams are too big. The former is common place stupidity...but the later is a rare species that is difficult to find.

Kirei: But they are identical in that they are both fools, are they not?

Gilgamesh: Isn’t the foolishness of a few a more precious commodity than the wisdom of the masses?There are those who were born human but harbor wishes that man was not meant for...and have renounced their humanity in its pursuit. I never grow weary of watching their grief and despair. Kirei, what of you?(dialogue from fate zero)

When I read alittle about Gilgamesh, the story says he wished to become a God, one of the Gods. To which the gods agreed, giving him a series of trials which if he passed, he would become a God. One of them involved staying up without sleep for seven days and seven nights which he failed. So in that paragraph where he ""never grows weary of watching grief and despair"", he's engaging in abit of Schadenfreude against himself and all like him. The Stoic sage is an ideal, obtainable? I don't know, but would the stoic sage be considered a human or a God?, a God I think. So isn't it's pursuit a form of renouncing one's humanity on some level? Plato's philosopher king encourages himself  in  his Meditations to ""stick to what seems right""(the best goal to achieve, the one we fall short of when we fail), and to ""celebrate behaving like a human being, however imperfectly"". Well, I feel like we should have a Stoic Failure Story tag to encourage empathy, vulnerability and authenticity even further in this community.

 Arthur Koestler theorized that; when children are impersonating adults, a comedian is impersonating a public figure, men are disguised as women and women are disguised as men. The impersonater is perceived as himself and as somebody else at the same time. That while this situation lasts, ""the two matrices are bissociated in the spectators mind. And while his intellect is capable of swiftly oscillating from one matrix to the other and back, his emotions are incapable of following these acrobatic turns. They are spilled into the gutters of laughter as soup is spilled on a rocking ship. Here I am thinking about Chrysipuss, who Seneca believed ""saw the very bottom of truth"" dying of laughter. Koestler further adds that ""we are literally ""poisoned"" by our adrenal humours, reason has little power over irritability or anxiety. It takes time to talk a person out of a mood, however valid the argument;passion is blind to better judgment; anger and fear show physical after affects long after their causes have been removed. If we could change our moods as quickly as we jump from one thought to another, we would be acrobats of emotion"". And I'm not sure why but this brings to mind Arriana Huffington's quote, ""sleep is a feature of the human operating system, not a bug"". Which is why Gilgamesh probably failed to become a God. ""But what says Zeus? ""Epictetus, if it were possible, I would have
made both your little body and your little property free and not
exposed to hindrance. But now be not ignorant of this: this body is
not yours, but it is clay finely tempered. And since I was not able to
do for you what I have mentioned, I have given you a small portion
of us, this faculty of pursuing an object and avoiding it, and the
faculty of desire and aversion, and, in a word, the faculty of using
the appearances of things; and if you will take care of this faculty
and consider it your only possession, you will never be hindered,
never meet with impediments; you will not lament, you will not
blame, you will not flatter any person.""_Discourses 1.1. I heard Peter Theil once say that if someone could innovate a pill that would safely eliminate the need  for sleep, he would move the world from zero to one. In a way though, this person would be considered a fool, the same way we think of Socrates, Diogenes, Epictetus as having moved the world from zero to one for championing a philosophy that has stood the test of time. And yet I feel these guys where probably considered fools on some level in their time, just as I believe they would be considered fools in my current society if they lived now as they lived then. ""..the truly original geniuses are rare compared with the enormous number of talented practioners; the former acting as spearheads, opening up new territories which the later will then diligently cultivate. There are periods of crisis, ""creative-anarchy"", leading to breakthroughs to new frontiers, followed by decades, or centuries of orthodoxy, consolidation, stagnation and decadence-- until a new crises arises, a holy discontent which starts the cycle again....""_The Act of Creation.

Are we always in control of our thoughts and reactions?,"I'm completely new to Stoicism and currently reading ""The Little Book of Stoicism"" as my introduction to the philosophy.

I've come to the point in the book where freedom of choice is being covered in depth, specifically the idea that we're unable to control external factors in our lives however we always have control over how we perceive and react to these things, the section also mentions that only we have the power to ruin our lives.

I'm struggling with these concepts a bit.

I believe we can control how we react and behave to an extent but only within our given biological parameters paired with the environmental stressor. I think certain situations are harder for some, easier for others.

E.g. 

- There are people who have behavioural difficulties that descrease impulse control
- There are others with severe mental health issues which can cause executive dysfunction
- Addicts exist whose brains will crave a substance as though they would die without it (they may also suffer with one of the other bullet points to boot)

While a ""good"" choice can still be made, the ability is reduced when compared to neurotypicals with good mental health.

Despite the above, I've still found the ""You can always control how you react"" approach really helpful. My worst life decsions have been made when emotions are running high, there have been had countless past worries that I've tortured myself with causing unnecessary suffering.

I've tried to adopt a more mindful approach when my emotions are high and I've seen good results... however there's a limit. If lost everyone I cared about tomorrow, I would be unable to remain calm in the same way Viktor Frankl did or see this as something indifferent to my eudaimonian. (Things we cannot control being seen as ""perferred indifferents"" at best.) My happiness is partly tied in with those I love and I'm not sure I'd want that to change because it would feel like cutting myself off emotionally. I get that it's unhealthy to entirely rely on those around us for happiness, but for me to care is to be emotionally invested. I believe that to love is to accept the possibility of emotional pain.

I'd like to get thoughts from those more familiar with the philosophy though please.",Stoicism,1703894447.0,t3_18u1fx5,0.77,7
how can I stop worrying about these things that are out of my control," Title. I am an 18 year old guy, and for the past week, I have been experiencing fatigue, nausea, dizziness, and derealization. I was in a very bad rabbit hole a couple days ago, that I still am some-what still in, but have gotten ALOT better.

I kept googling, searching on reddit, trying to figure out what was wrong with me, and so I started to think I had: long covid (since i got it in july) , CFS, diabetes, kidney disease, bppv, dysautonomia, candida overgrowth (which ive now found out is fake), sibo induced symptoms (since i have gi issues for over a year now) , gastritis induced symptoms, you name it and i probably thought I had it.

I've found out alot about myself while going through this whole rabbit hole, and I've realized that im not really scared of ""death"" per say, I am more scared of not living my life because of a chronic illness not allowing me to live my life, and there for because I keep worrying about that, I don't really live my life.

My anxiety has gotten so bad, that now I can't really go to the gym without thinking I am having a heart attack or I keep focusing on the littlest things when working out. Like how much I yawn during my workouts. While I do think most of my symptoms are from my anxiety, I just can not help but think in the back of my head that there is some chronic condition that I have, that is also causing these symptoms. I just don't know what to do. I am trying to look for a therapist, and potentially get an evaluation done to see if maybe I'll need anti-anxiety meds?

Today I dealt with a toxic person in a stoic way,"Long story short 2023 was a really bad year for me, I was learning about stoicism but got away from the path at some point and let my negative emotions and anxiety dominate me 

I was super anxious about a college exam and so asked my friend if I could go to his house and say that I was worried, after that I got a bunch of messages from his jealous and egocentric girlfriend (who I used to call my friend) calling me a bitch that I was trying to have sex with him and saying that I was ugly and etc 

I tried to explain that I just wanted someone to talk with and even said that I was aroace but she ignored it

After that I noticed that I need stoicism back to my life and read meditations and took the idea of the 2.1 text “ I shall meet with the busybody, the ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial. All these things happen to them by reason of their ignorance of what is good and evil. But I who have seen the nature of the good that it is beautiful, and of the bad that it is ugly, and the nature of him who does wrong, that it is akin to me, not [only] of the same blood or seed, but that it participates in [the same] intelligence and [the same] portion of the divinity, I can neither be injured by any of them” 

And realised that that’s how she is, she’s aggressive and insecure and there’s nothing that I can change about it, today she tried to hurt me again and I simply ignored her, why bother with toxic people ?",Stoicism,1703875341.0,t3_18tu41m,0.93,72
Stoicism in the face of injustice,"I'm wondering, as I haven't been through all the literature yet, how do stoic deal with severe types of injustice.

For example: A mother fought very hard to safeguard her child from an abusive husband.
The child is safe now.
However, disease and misfortune strikes the mother and after a long struggle, she dies, leaving her child vulnerable again.
All the while, the abusive father runs rampant, never being held accountable for his deeds, experiencing the bare minimum of bad luck.
Worst case scenario, custody gets transfered to the father.

In a more severe case, this is the story of a sibling; or your mother.

How do stoics interpret these events; how do you deal with the sense of injustice in such situations?

Thank you.",Stoicism,1703859914.0,t3_18to9q1,0.79,11
Overcoming a major life mistake,"Would appreciate some guidance on how might a stoic best navigate a major life mistake?

I feel humiliated and defeated.  I know the past cannot be changed.  So all I can do is calmly set about dealing with the consequences in the present.

My mind, traditionally very determined and focused, is lacking the discipline to stay away from the humiliation mindset, the negative self talk, and the desire to keep going back to the past to fix things.  I allowed the initial situation to jar me so deeply that I fell in a vicious cycle.  That cycle drained everything out of me.  I speculate that’s why my previously strong mind seems almost unruly now.

How does one regain one’s head after losing it?  I don’t know if perhaps any of you has had any personal experience with this.

Thanks very much.",Stoicism,1703855528.0,t3_18tmu04,0.9,22
Diversity of thought in Stoicsm,"I would love to hear everyone’s take on a few related questions:

1. Diversity in early Stoicism: Do you think there was greater diversity of thought among the early Stoic philosophers compared to modern interpretations? 

2. Influence of surviving texts: Considering we learn about Stoicism through the few texts that have survived, to what extent do you believe our understanding is shaped, or perhaps limited, by this? Even among these sources aren’t there differences and contradictions?

3. Embracing diversity of opinion today: Given the potential variations in early Stoic thought, could we be more open to diverse interpretations of Stoicism in our community?",Stoicism,1703855247.0,t3_18tmqxv,0.75,2
Moving from fear of death to acceptance of it,"I’m looking for some stoic perspective on thoughts of death and negative visualization.

Recently, a few months ago, I had a surgery and ever since then my little mind is obsessed with the thought of the implant causing my death eventually. Thus, I notice I fear exercise, stopped hobbies, seeing friends, have no motivation for life. Some would call this a depressive episode, and suicidal thoughts were there for a few weeks but I overcame them after some time in therapy. As residue I feel like the fear is a  constant.

While I know that these are just thoughts, they seem to subconsciously define my living now. I keep analyzing my symptoms, the physical pain sensations, and mind feeds me images of me dying. And instead of accepting them, I fear them and am obsessed with them. I find it impossible to focus on anything else. Prior the surgery I found negative visualization a very powerful technique for relief and gratitude but now it only feeds the fears and suffering. Weird.

I have read a bunch of posts here on health, aging, and death, but I felt like reaching out nevertheless. Does someone wiser here have any perspective to offer me on this situation?",Stoicism,1703846640.0,t3_18tkdef,0.74,9
Is there any semblance of a Path offered in Stoicism?,"I was having a discussion with a friend of mine on the differences between Buddhism and Stoicism.

In many Buddhist traditions, there is a clear path to follow towards an enlightened state of mind. E.g., Lam Rim in Tibetan Buddhism. This path involves a defined set of practices to follow that are graduated according to different capabilities. Meditation is the core daily practice in the path.

By following a path, I mean following practices hat are different than simply acting as if one was in the end state already (acting in an enlightened way). For example, in Buddhism, there are practices of focusing on the breath or another meditation object; also practices of doing body scans of various parts of the body. This has little to do with enlightenment itself, but is more about training the mind in ways that are conducive for enlightenment.

In Stoicism, we hear of the most ideal ways to act in multiple life situations, but are there any paths or practices offered by the philosophers to work towards making those ideal ways to act come spontaneously (vs. just trying to act in a stoically correct way as much as possible from the beginning)? Resources appreciated.",Stoicism,1703840430.0,t3_18tit9x,0.67,2
Dreading the dawn of a new year and beyond it,"Some of you might be thinking, aren't t people supposed to be happy and feeling fresh for a new year. Well not so much for me. I'm a teenager. I got to put up with harder subjects, difficult teachers, in a new environment because of changing classes and having to put up with my family's reprimands or strict ideals. I know this might all sound minor.

But to top it off, I've experienced possibly the most gruelling period of my life I had ever faced. You might want to read my posts back in around April-July this year. Assuming that you've read my posts, I have developed a trauma towards the whole experience. I do not want to degrade others with much worse traumatic experiences. I'm afraid that next year I will have another ""gruelling period of my life"". Now the one back in April-July left me traumatised, so it makes the fear much more scarier. I'm not traumatized by the event itself, but the process of overcoming it. I went through a lot of struggle just to cope and overcome. And it was so arduous to go through that now I am intensely afraid of experiencing that same pain and struggle of overcoming another occurrence. Sometimes when I come across scenarios where the atmosphere feels similar to one of the situations back then, I would actually start to become self-conscious and panic. I would physically feel my heart starting to feel uncomfortable. Again, from an external view, this might seem a bit minor but for me it was definitely damaging so bear with me.

A part of me knows going through it is necessary for growth and learning. Since it was exactly that period of April-July that forced me to find something to help cope with things, that being finding Stoicism. Any similar hurdles in the future may also present the same kind of opportunities. 

But I can't help but worry and fear that similar things will occur in the next few years of my life. Just imagining having to go through so much of that same traumatic struggle. And this trauma causes the fear of suffering to overpower the fear of remaining static or the lack of growth. I also can't help but worry about the far future of my life as a whole and all the difficult things I need to deal with along the way. But I'll assume I won't live that long, and even telling myself this isn't enough (I am not suicidal by any means).

I'm aware that there are many stoic doctrines that can help with my situation or that this anxiety is just fleeting and should just live with it. But despite that I still can't help but worry. And I'm really starting to lose my ground to the present. It just keeps occupying my mind full of these scary images. And I don't have the time or privacy to randomly close my eyes and spend 5 or 10 minutes to mentally rehearse all my approaches(that's how I personally do it). Any advice from fellow stoic practitioners is much appreciated. It's also best if your response can be concentrated on all the aspects I've mentioned and thank you for understanding.🙏",Stoicism,1703836499.0,t3_18thtux,0.72,3
Wanting other peoples lives,"I’ve been trying to study Stoicism and focus on my own life and improving it, not in a selfish way but just making my life better. One thing I can’t get rid of is the comparison to every body in my life. It makes it hard for me to focus on doing the right thing and putting effort into my life because I just want what others have. I want to live and experience stuff they do.

"Recently started studying stoicism, what direction to go for better emotional control over things I cannot change?","A little background, most of my life I’ve been extremely stoic without even knowing what it was. Until I was 26, I would even say it was bordering on pathological and uncaring. I went in the military after high school and had never found anything emotionally difficult in my life, be that deaths of family or friends or anything else. I felt nothing, no honor, pride, or anything, even regarding my time in the military. Everyone would tell me how weird that is to not be proud and I never really understood that until now. 

At 26, my life took an extremely sudden turn. Following the break up with the only woman I had ever loved, suddenly, and if by magical intervention, I began experiencing emotion on a level I failed to control or understand. The first six months were absolutely horrible but since then I’ve been able to for the most part control it. But it has been an incredibly weird and interesting learning curve. Even though I broke up with her a year and a half ago, I am still vastly more emotional than I have been at any point in my life prior. Everything from movies to friendships to failure with women, etc., has caused some kind of emotional response whether it is something I can control or not. 

The last six months I’ve been back in the gym, picked up boxing, and studying/reading about a lot of topics. Just generally continuing my self improvement. Once again I have found myself upset at something I can no longer control. I finally set up a date to ask a woman out who I have known for over a year, just for that very same day to be the day she told me she is finally in a relationship again. There’s nothing I can do now, I missed my chance and anything other than supporting her would be wrong. 

This has prompted me to look into and begin studying stoicism. I dusted off a book a friend gave me several months ago called How to Be a Stoic: Using Ancient Philosophy to Live a Modern Life. I have been reading and taking notes. So far I have been extremely pleased with this ideology. I honestly think this is my solution and my framework for learning how to channel my old stoic behavior towards things of which I have no control while maintaining this newfound emotion for things in my control.

I’d greatly appreciate any help pointing me in the right direction regarding authors, books to read next, or any stoic philosophers that come to mind in my situation. I am very excited and hopeful that stoicism will help me reach what I am beginning to expect it can. Stoicism just seems like the perfect framework for balancing out my life. 

TLDR- For most of my life I was very stoic until a break up caused me to become quite emotional. After studying stoicism the little I have, I believe it can help me channel my stoic nature towards things changeable and my newfound emotion towards things I can change.",Stoicism,1703817065.0,t3_18tbvhg,0.85,18
"Running away from ""change"" but how to stop that in 2024 ?","

I'm not sure what the right phrase is like comfort zone, change, responsibilities, take life serious, take actions. I feel like I've been avoiding working on my life for almost 2 years now and now that 2024 is about to come in few days. The feeling of regret and shame is boiling down internally. I'm reflecting so much right to a point Im feeling overwhelmed and emotionally mentally exhausted. I realize my mistake and I don't blame nobody but me. I knew I was suppose to not let failures stop me but for years I just accepted it and live in this passive life mindset. I didn't have the guts or courage to stand up and make a change. I'm already in mid-20s but barely have any work experience besides fast food and retail store aka people call dead end jobs. My age group people have already some finished college, working in desired field jobs, in a relationship, overcoming fears, living in the adulthood independent life instead of staying with parents. Meanwhile I ask myself like what am I doing and when is my time gonna come in life. For how long am I gonna sit home scrolling phone and avoiding life. Sooner or later life is gonna slap me yet I'm already feeling all this all but I'm just not understanding why am I not taking action.

Following my passion or following what my parents think is best for me.,"I (M,23, working class) hardly go out, I study at college (it's free here) and live in a developing country. I have friendships that are not really friendships since I hardly interact with them and I don’t have much in common, in reality I just have two true friends which I see seldom. My mother (F,41) says that I need to get out of my shell, wake up, go out more and I just realized that what I really like is art, which is a great coincidence; however, I am very clear that I want to dedicate myself to art and design, after drawing since childhood and coming up with stories, ideas and new narratives since childhood also and being part of an NGO and doing great things for the Marketing Department. I also decided I could look for groups with interests similar to mine. My mother, however, tells me that I have to look for other environments besides the one I want, to see how the real world is, and that I have to open up to other environments and that she can accommodate me in a job with my father where I can learn how to relate to other people, but that is not what I want at all, because I feel that I would be betraying myself and my ideals if I take that job. She is also looking for opportunities for me within her job, and says that I have to open up or else, I will be lost for many years like my father (M,41), who has been in the limbo of jobs he didn't like until he found a stable job (although, my father always wanted to be a full-time musician but wanted to find other jobs out of necessity cause he had a child, me, even though there were lots of opportunities as a musician). I have also worked for a Google Partner agency for some months but they fired me cause I couldn't meet the KPIs, and honestly, I didn't like that job and also had school and my volunteering at the NGO. That is my problem, choosing between dedicating myself to what I like fully or doing other things and leaving art and design as a hobby. As additional information, I have gone through diagnosed Generalized Anxiety which was crippling at the beginning but that over time it has lost power, and really in social environments I have trouble staying focused and I tend to be extroverted in some situations but according to my mother I do things that are not relevant or that are not socially acceptable (basically I lack social skills and everyone can step on me, as she says), such as asking an Uber driver politely if he can change the music being someone I just met today, or asking them (my parents) what they are talking about when I get to the table with them, that according to her. She also told me that I have to adapt to this society that is very superficial, in this developing Latin American country, since she lived it that way. Basically image sells way better than intelligence and competence, and she is saying about my attire and that I need to dress better, to which I agree. What can I do about it? What would be your advice? I understand that she wants the best for me and cares for me considering the situation in which we live in, but I just took a path I realized I didn't want once with my first degree, and lived in fear and pending for other people's approval for way too long (to which my mother disapproves because she says that if that was the case, I would be working on myself already).

Looking for the source of a quote by Marcus Aurelius,"I'm looking for the source of a quote about criticism. I believe its from Marcus Aurelius but I can't find it. I googled and found a reference to it here:

[https://dailystoic.com/how-to-not-be-afraid-of-criticism/#:\~:text=As%20Marcus%20Aurelius%20writes%2C%20if,and%20already%20be%20fixing%20it](https://dailystoic.com/how-to-not-be-afraid-of-criticism/#:~:text=As%20Marcus%20Aurelius%20writes%2C%20if,and%20already%20be%20fixing%20it)

>""As Marcus Aurelius writes, if that criticism is correct and we are in error then the person criticizing us has done us a favor by correcting it. If they are wrong, what do we care? More likely, if we are doing our job right, we should already be well aware of the issue that people are raising and already be fixing it.""

EDIT: Please... this is about the correct source of the quote and not about Ryan Holiday. IMHO quotes without specifying the source of the quotes are almost worthless because then you can't check the context of the quote.

But so far I was unable to locate this in the Meditations. I did find Meditations 5.3 which is similar but not the same:

>\[3\] Judge yourself entitled to say or do anything that’s in accord with nature, and don’t let yourself be talked out of it by any criticism or argument that may follow as a consequence. If it was the right thing to do or say, don’t put yourself down. Other people have their own command centers and their own impulses, and you shouldn’t let your attention be caught by them, but carry straight on,6 following your own nature and universal nature, two things that share a single path.

Epictetus Encheiridion 42 is similar:

>42. When someone acts badly towards you, or speaks badly of you, remember that he is acting or speaking in that way because he regards that as being the proper thing for him to do. Now, it isn’t possible for him to act in accordance with what seems right to you, but only with what seems right to him. So if he judges wrongly, he is the one who suffers the harm, since he is the one who has been deceived. For if anyone should think a true composite judgement\* to be false, the judgement itself isn’t harmed, but the person who has been deceived. If you start out, then, from this way of thinking, you’ll be gentle with someone who abuses you, for in each case you’ll say, ‘That is how it seemed to him.’

Can somebody please give me the source of the Marcus Aurelius quote (Meditations book/chapter) ? I don't want to use this like 'Somewhere in the internet I found that Ryan Holiday said that Marcus Aurelius said that,,,""

Thank you in advance.

Oh, BTW, if I'm incorrect and its not from Marcus Aurelius then I made a mistake and feel free to correct me, I will not be harmed :D",Stoicism,1703761895.0,t3_18srj8d,0.67,3
"Breaking the cycle, how?","Hey fellow stoics, I have some questions that I like to gain some insight in. Also, sorry for using a throwaway.

Some background about me. I have what I would consider a successful and fulfilled life. On the other hand I have always dealt with some mild level of anxiety, depression, perfectionism and self doubt. Not exactly to the point where I consider this clinically relevant but it's still annoying and probably the root cause of some of the issues I dealt with for years (if this is relevant I can go into details at a later point).
I have some formal (university level) training in philosophy and stumbled on stoicism a couple of years ago. I read Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and a couple of others.

So here is the issue: on a rational level all of stoicism makes perfect sense to me. I can subscribe to almost all if not all of the points, BUT... I feel like I struggle big time applying them to everyday life. How much varies by occasion but in general I blame this to my latent anxiety issues. I want to give two examples:

I have a rather annoying and difficult neighbour. This person is for some reasons, which I can partly empathize with (although I'm legally and morally in the right), angry at me and tries to make my life harder. To this date almost all of the stuff are minor incursions, making noise, minor insults, throwing rubbish over the fence in my garden now and then. Rationally I know perfectly well that I should ignore him, that I should just continue to live my life. This situation continues for half a year now and the agressions Come in waves. Whenever there is a new set I'm losing my composure and start spiraling into a fear hate anxiety thought spiral which wrecks my whole day. When I try to rationalise this there are still the physiological symptoms, heart beating, muscle tension etc. This immediately pulls me back.

Second example are certain interactions with my son. There are certain instances where his behaviour is triggering my rage and this is 100% out of that I love him and see that a certain behaviour in his future will probably hurt him and so I have to somehow deal with this. Whenever I throw a fit I immediately regret it because I realise how irrational this is. Also there mostly the physiological reactions suck me completely in and my rational brain shuts off.

Those are but two examples where I have a huge cognitive dissonance between how I know I should act correctly and how I actually react.

About things you cannot control,"I am new to this. What i understand is stoicism focuses on things you have control on, how to control things you can control. By default, humans are bad about distinguishing what they are in control of, and what they are not, and they are bad about actually controlling things they can control.

However, does stoicism promise to completely let go of things you cannot control, no matter how grim, exhausting and horrible they are? In the sub i noticed a frequent answer of ""Do you have control on it? If not, just go and focus on things you have control on"".

 To me its not realistic, to just not care and not be bothered by things you dont have control on. Similiar to be a buddist monk, to let go of earthly desires etc. Those who actually achieve that are born in temple culture and has no metropolian city problems in the first place. 

Maybe you can be bothered less, maybe you realize they are not that important to be bothered so much and let go, but can a hypotetical person John, who is cancer, is 4'5'' height adult male and in a third world country with a very toxic family, with no way out of his house, achieve to be not bothered by all this?

Thinking less extreme, i see its completely normal to be bothered by being unattractive for example. It is objectively hurting your social status especially dating. Maybe you are not absolutely doomed, but to simply say ""just focus on things you have control on"" sounds a shitty advice to be honest. ",Stoicism,1703760742.0,t3_18sr89r,0.67,5
How to best practice stoic values?,"In particular I’m having trouble letting go of that which I cannot control.

I had what I deemed the perfect life about a year ago.  I’d worked decades for it.  A turn of futures changed that early this year.

We broke up in January over a personal tragedy of mine.  Now not only do I still have that personal tragedy to live with the rest of my life; I lost the woman I wanted to build a life with.  The personal tragedy left me with fewer prospects at a time in my life when I had already started feeling the pressure to start a family.

Struggling to radically accept my tragedy and my diminished prospects.  Even if rationally I can see that I have no control over the past and only reaction to it, I still struggle to no get down a year into it.

December’s Trials,"The month of December’s been a real test. In order of sequence.

* Mass Layoffs in my organization. I was forced to lay off 12 people on my team. About 70%.
* My cat of 12 years was diagnosed with lymphatic cancer. He died two weeks later in my arms when we euthanized him while he was starting to have congestive heart failure.
* We got a call my wife’s father was going to pass. Got on a 5 hour flight to a different country the next morning. He died 3 days later when we were in the room. Difficult scenario. Multiple religions. Multiple cultures. His burial wishes were odds with the family. I had to mediate between passionate people.
* Got a respiratory illness on the plane there, kicked into full gear by the time I flew back.
* Multiple hour plane delays.
* By Christmas Eve I got gastritis. Recovering now.

I had Stoicism by my side throughout. Quick reminders to calibrate me at the thousand moments throughout it all.

When my cat passed, I remember feeling grateful to have premeditated on this event for many years, never having lost an opportunity to enjoy him. Taking comfort in knowing I did my best to save him. And helped his passing when nothing else could. I’ll miss that little guy. But he’s been restored now.

When I was mediating a difficult family situation I anchored everything around what my proper role was in this family as a husband of a wife. A son-in-law. A guest.

When I got sick I recall being grateful for an opportunity to be reminded how nice it was to be absent of symptoms. There was one day I had a 7 hour migraine, pain piercing through all thoughts except a thought that I desired for things to be exactly as they were.

There were a thousand moments for Stoicism. A thousand reflections. It saved me from so many passions. But I won’t lie to you and pretend I was free from them.

When my cat passed, I was angry at the universe for about a day. In temporary disbelief, even though I witnessed his passing with my own eyes. I was inconsolable.

Now that I’m through it all. I have to admit I am exhausted. I would even go as far as saying I feel depressed. Like missing joi de vivre. Like the world lost some saturation in its colour. I cannot diagnose the cause for this, so I am giving it some time.

We go through these things because we have to. The only choice we have is in how we choose to take it on.

I recall Zeno’s story of the dog and the cart. I recall Marcus talking about what bearable pain is. I recall Epictetus and his many lessons about loss and one’s proper role. And envisioning how you’d like to maintain your character in adversity. I recall many of the people of this community, their insights and advice to others. And I am grateful to have encountered such wisdom.",Stoicism,1703731071.0,t3_18site3,0.85,20
Modern/simplified books about stoic philosophy?,"I've been listening to meditations by Marcus Aurelius and am trying to learn about stoic philosophy.

Struggling to balance the teachings of stoicism with other conflicting philosophies,"I (19M) recently got into stoicism this last summer, as the teachings of self control and freeing oneself of anxiety deeply resonated with me. Marcus’ Meditations was actually the first book I’ve completed out of my own interest, rather than being forced to read by a school curriculum. I began to implement many of the stoic teachings into my life and found mostly positive results.

However, recently I’ve started to get into conflicting philosophies, such as Machiavellianism and I have picked up books like Robert Greene’s 48 Laws of Power to supplement this interest. Through reading works like the 48 Laws of power, I came to a realization that it is nearly impossible to balance these 2 differing ideologies at once. Both these ways of thinking resonate with me in different ways, both being equally compelling.

Against Nature as Grounds for Compassion,"*  Musonius Rufus, like the other Stoics, advocated love for our fellow man. So then, what justification does Rufus give for compassion? He argues that compassion is in accordance with human nature. He justifies this by pointing to what we can observe in both human beings and bees, with both species cooperating with their own.
* My problem with this is that all kinds of things we would consider evil, such as rape and murder, are also part of human nature. Does that mean we must do those things too?
* Rufus would, I believe based on certain passages, counter this by saying things like rape and murder are hated and punished in all societies, at least within the boundaries of said societies (native American tribes would have no qualms about hurting members of other groups).
* The problem would be that this is a justification based on social consensus. It would be essentially saying ""Society approves it, therefore it is right"". And yet, there are things that societies past and present have approved of that are obviously immoral. Child sacrifice, female genital mutilation and ritual animal torture are things that have been or still are practiced and approved of under social consensus, and the reader of this message would most likely reject them with vehemence.
* Therefore we must conclude that nature, whether it be the nature of individual humans or the nature of society, is no grounds for compassion. ",Stoicism,1703699673.0,t3_18s6mnh,0.67,1

Emotional Repression w/Misapplication of Stoicism,"
u/SimonDK1994 brought up a very good point to my previous post: 

1.	⁠Make **S**ure to acknowledge your feel**i** n **g**s. People trying to practice stoicis**m** tend to surpress feelings before they learn th**a**t they should actually acknowledge them more and THEN deal with them rationally. This can lead to pinned up emotions and at some point send their world crashing down.(Ask me how i know)

I have been reflecting on it a lot more, and realize that I’ve actually been repre**s**sing my emotions *a lot* more than I thought. So I did more studying, and I’ve concluded the following: 

If there is a situation that ruffles me up, such as the train being delayed, I feel inpatient and angry. Because I’m trying to practice Stoicism, I usually would remind myself “Be calm, there’s nothing to be angry about.” This never actually wor**k**ed as **i** would *pretend* that I’m calm and **b** el **i**eve I was succee**di**ng, but inside I was reaching my boiling point. The issue here is that emotions are dependent variables, so we cannot simply say “Don’t be angry, there’s nothing to be angry about” as the anger has already been produced. If I want to not be angry, the anger has to genuinely not come in the first place. If it does, that is when we should reason to attempt calm ourselves down, not to pretend that we can just will our emotions away. Wait, is that what Epictetus meant when he said, 

“*For this reason also it is ridiculous to say, “Suggest something to me.” What should I suggest to you? “Well, form my mind so as to accommodate itself to any event.” Why that is just the same as if a man who is ignorant of letters should say, “Tell me what to write when any name is proposed to me.” For if I should tell him how to write Dion, and then another should come and propose to him not the name of Dion but that of Theon, what will be done? What will he write? But if you have practiced writing, you are also prepared to write anything that is required. If you are not, what can I now suggest? For if circumstances require something else, what will you say, or what will you do? Remember then this general precept and you will need no suggestion. But if you gape after externals, you must of necessity ramble up and down in obedience to the will of your master. And who is the master? He who has the power over the things which you seek to gain or try to avoid.*” - Discourse 2.2 “Of Tranquility from Pertubation”

If we injured our leg, it has already been injured, so just telling yourself to calm down is like telling someone to “just walk” on their injured leg.

So then we need to focus on the independent variable(s). Would that be our impressions? ",Stoicism,1703661595.0,t3_18rutqx,0.78,5

Best book / text that talks about indifference,"Hi there, 

I have very little exposure to Stoicism, knowing only the basics. I have pretty sever OCD and intrusive thoughts and I have tried to deal with them through meds and talking therapy.

How would you proceed in my situation from a stoic point of view? Advice for dealing with a flaky friend,"A friend I considered close has disappointed me and out of curiosity I would like to hear how others may choose to act in this situation (from a stoic point of view).

A month ago I had a low point and messaged my friend if she could call me whenever she was free. No response.

A month passes and she completely ignores the message. I know she'd been out partying etc. At the very least she could've messaged me just to let me know she's a little busy and will catch up when she's available etc. out of respect. 

Additionally, I usually spend Christmas with her family because I'm in a foreign country and I've gotten close with them; they are always so caring and kind to me. Before this silent month, she had mentioned the invite from her parents again. But since ignoring my message she also never followed up on that invite or bothered checking on my Christmas plans etc. I also did not feel comfortable reaching out to inquire about coming over for Christmas since she hasn't even had the courtesy to open my message. 

Finally I receive a lame message from her on the 23rd about how she apparently didn't notice my message and that she's been busy working and fell ill on the week etc.

Life not going my way. People talking badly about me. How do I handle it?," 

Hello!

To give some context, I'm a medical student. I'm quite poor and racking up student loans, but I chose not to get a job because I cannot handle my school workload along with work. I have to say a lot of these medical students are quite wealthy, well connected and are related to doctors who can help them learn, show them resources and etc. I don't have any of that. I came from a poor immigrant family. I got discriminated by ethnicity and wealth. Now in med school, I'm somewhat struggling, not failing but not in a comfortable position in terms of grades and skills. Unbeknownst to some people med students can be some of the most toxic people you'll meet: Hypercompetitive, back stabbing, fake and etc. They constantly lie that their skills and grades and purely out of their natural intellect instead of admitting their connections and money helped (Some of my classmates will voluntarily say that they read the textbook but I later found out they don't and used outside studying material or they got jobs in the hospitals because their parents worked there and had connections, but refuse to acknowledge that; there was a pattern I noticed. In my city, it's currently hard to find a job right now and when I applied in the summer none hired me. The only classmates I knew who got hired were the ones who admitted their parents worked in the hospital.

Some of my classmates have been talking badly about me. Some of them have slandered me. I also have to fund my parent's retirement because they didn't save enough. At this point in life I kinda want to give up. I am disadvantaged, my classmates and even some of the unit nurses have talked badly about me. I deal with this regularly since I am in school or studying most of the time. I am not handling it well.

"""The beginning of philosophy ... is an awareness of one’s own weakness and incapacity when it comes to the most important things."" -- Epictetus","Kind of going back to basics on this one (from Discourses 2.11).  Came across this as I was reflecting on my struggles with letting go of past mistakes. 

Had a realization that it boiled down to my own arrogance as I looked back on my life.  I was holding my younger self to an unrealistic standard of perfection, that I *should* have thought and acted a certain way (given what I know now).  

Once I started accepting my own flawed nature as a typical human being, I could look back upon my earlier failures with more compassion and forgiveness.  With this came welcome sense of peace and relief.

As Ward Farnsworth puts it in The Practicing Stoic:

How would a stoic react to bullying?,"

Just graduated from high school, but the entirety of my last semester was spent being gaslit and bullied by one of the school’s favorite students. They promoted her as the most perfect person in the school so I felt like there was an ideal I could never measure up to as a boy, meanwhile she constantly mocked and belittled all of the boys in our class including me, but when I tried to tell the teachers about it she targeted me specifically.  She gaslit me into thinking I was some kind of monster she couldn’t feel safe around and I was scared to go into school most of the time. When I tried to talk to her about it, still thinking she was a good person, she got the teachers to shut me down entirely. Now I was not only being manipulated and bullied, but I couldn’t defend myself. Meanwhile the school, a Christian school btw, promoted her as the most perfect and Christ like student. She was one of their best athletes as well. The teachers refused to do anything about her and I ended up in some pretty disturbing patterns including potential suicide. I eventually came to find out that she was bullying everyone else too, but it was all completely permissible by the school. I don’t know what to make of my faith as a whole if that is what Christianity looks like. I’ve been in therapy for the past several months and I’ve been out of school entirely since may, but she is living in my head rent free and she will not leave.

Practice of stoicism or complacency?,"Lately, I have tried to speak up more in situation I don't like.

I am honestly torn between these 2 ideas:
1) The Original Way: Accept that everyone out there is playing a role in my growth and the burdens I am given are just tests that I must accept and deal with them.
2) The Other Way: Speak up, try to change the situation if given, but if it doesn't, then accept it.

I am a big fan of balance, and I think the 2nd approach helps to achieve that. Since I lean towards being complacent, I should try to be more vocal.

Applying principles in day to day life,"Hello, folks.

I have read about Stoicism for some time now, and am slowly but surely making my way through a number of books. My initial introduction was quite by accident when I encountered Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. This has also led me to read Letters from a Stoic - Seneca (I am not finished), and some of Epictetus (Discourse and selected writings. Translation,etc...by Robert Dobbin)

So much of this seems to make sense to me and I think there is real value in this philosophy. However, being so new to this, I am having difficulty in translating philosophy to concrete actions that I can take.  Amongst the most simplistic, but incredibly difficult for me to do is changing my mindset. For example, Epictetus states, “Man is disturbed not by things, but by the views he takes of them.”,and Marcus Aurelius states writes, ""Do not waste time on what you cannot control.”

What are concrete steps one can take in this direction? 

I have read the [Advice and Coping With Problems Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/wiki/advice/#wiki_advice_and_coping_with_problems), and again this makes sense when Epictetus wrote in Discourses that this takes time. (In answer to a man wanting a fig.) ""Let the tree blossom first, then put forth its fruit, and finally let the fruit ripen. Now although the fruit of even a fig-tree is not brought to perfection all at once and in a single hour, would you still seek to secure the fruit of a man's mind in so short a while and so easily?""

How does one even plant the seed of fig tree to begin with? 

* Are there concrete steps that one can take to plant the seed? 
* Once this seed is planted, are there concrete steps that one can take to build the mindset to manage how one views things?

Thank you for your advice and allowing me a moment of your valuable time!

Senecas view on frequent travel,"Hi everyone! I just started reading ""Letters from a Stoic"" by Seneca. In Letter II of the book, Seneca states the following:  
""To be everywhere is to be nowhere. People who spend their whole life travelling abroad end up having plenty of places where they can find hospitality but not real friendships"".

I wanted to pose an argument to this statement. I am hoping to have others chime in with their own view / a response that may have been expected from a person like Seneca:  


Is it necessary to be somewhere? I argue that the brief and admittedly capricious interactions with other travellers and locals often exceeds the knowledge and wisdom that is to be gained at home. If I prioritised a friendship at home at the expense of gaining new cultural perspectives or wisdom from people I meet abroad, would I not be prioritising a passion over wisdom? Could the desire to form friendships not be interpreted as exactly that, a passion? Wisdom is a virtue part of the true good. Would it not by necessity be more valuable to seek out wisdom that is not otherwise to be gained at home, at the expense of lasting friendships? Sure, wisdom and new cultural experiences can be gained at home, but there is an air of complacency with lasting friendships that do not stimulate new perspectives the same way that frequent travel abroad does.

During a tragedy, can you actually find peace in knowing that a the universe just went that way chaotically?",Stoicism,1703348513.0,t3_18p94ca,0.67,2
Do we have to control the good in us?,"So I just woke up and started thinking about something I said yesterday. I told someone that in every human being there is good and bad and we have to accept the bad in us and learn to control it, so it doesn’t take control over us (as in overtaking us ig).

Now I’m thinking a stoic would probably tell me that we need to control our good too, as moderation is usually key. But then what’s left? Do we need some sort of balance because we can’t let go of our control of the good, because this will ultimately lead to back to the bad (e.g. maximizing joy in the moment, which leads to short term satisfaction but results in long term negative consequences (additional e.g. impulsive, reckless behavior)).

Does it all boil down to gaining as much control over ourselves as we can?

Questions about humanity and passions,"Hello there! Im new here since i just saw Stoicism in school, lol. Now, it was quite an interesting philosophy! I like it :D

But i have some questions:

Mrs Teacher told us that stoics must control their passions and use reason instead, so that way they act in a wise way. Passions arent necesarilly bad, some are good, others bad and other regular. But thats why they need to be kept under control.  If people get carried away by their passions, they dont act in a reasonable way and only cause more damage. I asked Mrs Teacher how much damage, she said ""Greed, war, hatred, etc.""

And i was like HOLY COW. 

1 - Passions really damage so much? The reason of why there is so much hatred, racism, war, greed and more, is because that most humans are passional beings and not rational beings?

2 - Also, how are we supposed to control our passions?

3 - If we somehow made that education promoted reasoning and all humanity became rational instead of passionae, how much better would the world be?

Thanks for reading. Merry christmas! :D",Stoicism,1703348104.0,t3_18p8z5k,0.43,0
Wait so the stoics had ideas of pneuma that doesn’t reflect contemporary scientific understanding?,Does this mean many of Marcus Aurelius ideas depends on you acknowledging the beliefs of the stoics even though they aren’t actually scientifically accurate?

Finding meaning in life,"Stoicism has already helped me in becoming a better person. I can focus better on my studies, I go to the gym regularly now. When I have a hard time getting out of bed, I think about, what Marcus Aurelius said in Meditations:

>>At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: “I have to go to work — as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for — the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?”
So you were born to feel “nice”? Instead of doing things and experiencing them? Don’t you see the plants, the birds, the ants and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks, putting the world in order, as best they can? And you’re not willing to do your job as a human being? Why aren’t you running to do what your nature demands?
You don’t love yourself enough. Or you’d love your nature too, and what it demands of you.<<

But right now, I really struggle with finding any meaning in life. I feel depressed almost every evening because I'm thinking ""What am I doing all this for?"" The problem is that I've always found meaning in a partner. And now that I've been single for a while I'm finally wondering what else there is to live for. (Also I don't want to forcibly find a partner while being a wreck right now).",Stoicism,1703334877.0,t3_18p4sdl,0.88,31
Can someone explain pneuma to me?,It’s kind of a mind soul thing? How did they explain it? And how does it return to the cosmos as they put it? Returns to the cosmos and is reused again as I think Seneca wrote.,Stoicism,1703329669.0,t3_18p3gya,0.83,11

On being content with myself and wanting to improve as a person,"Hello!

I'm reading Seneca's 'Letters from a Stoic' right now, and I just read letter 7, on crowds. I understood the main message of the letter, but came to a point where I struggle with understanding, or more importantly, putting into practice.

Of course I know I have many vices. I can be very impulsive and feel like my emotions control me, although I know both have improved greatly since I have been exposed to stoicism. However, I struggle with my self image and loving myself knowing I have all those flaws.

How Stoicism is helping me stay alive (from suicidal ideation),"Even if I can never truly be considered a Stoic, I am determined to try my best to become as close as I can to it. For some quick background; I’ve grown up in poverty, suffered years as a child through sexual abuse, I’ve attempted suicide near the beginning of the year and have been admitted to the mental hospital 4 times this year, lost my job, evicted, cheated on (after 4.5 years) - ending my first relationship, lost all of my friends, kicked out of college etc. I am not attempting to elicit sympathy. I see suicide brought up quite often in the subreddit, so I am trying to offer my assistance. As of such, please correct me if I am misapplying and/or misinterpreting any of the ideas. 

**1. Virtue: COURAGE**
Life is feeling quite uncomfortable at the moment; Just as I believe it can’t get any worse, it just keeps throwing more and more surprises my way. Although I am working to *change* my outlook on life, my current belief is that life will not get better and I will just experience more suffering. I *suppose* that this isn’t true, but I genuinely do not believe its falsehood - **yet**. By practicing the virtue of courage I am accepting that fact and living *in spite* of that belief. As corny as it sounds: it takes courage to live. Courage is not living in the absence of fear, but to live *despite* those fears and discomforts. 

Another aspect of courage is *actually seeking professional help*, and having the courage to put my faith in these professionals’ hands. It was hard as I had ZERO faith that it would work, but lemme tell ya, **it’s working**. 

**2. Epictetus, Discourse 1.18 “That we ought not to be angry with the errors (faults) of others”**

 “*Learn that a thief and an adulterer have no place in the things which are yours, but in those which belong to others and which are not in your power. If you dismiss these things and consider them as nothing, with whom are you still angry? But so long as you value these things, be angry with yourself rather than with the thief and the adulterer.*” 

I use this concept to cope with 1: The infidelity and 2: The years of sexual abuse I’ve been through. Regarding the infidelity, their loyalty is exactly that: *their* loyalty, meaning it is theirs to give and theirs to take back whenever they please. Even if they agreed to give it to me, nothing hinders them from betraying that agreement. In this case, they have chosen to take it back, and therefore have communicated this to me through their actions. At that point, it’s up to me to decide how I respond to what they’ve communicated - we are no longer together. The decision to end it is not about hating or resenting them. If the only thing in my power is the right use of appearances, then I’ve concluded the following: It’s because I want loyalty. They’ve proven to be an unreliable source for that, and therefore it would be senseless to desire something from someone that they’ve *proven* to be unable to provide. 

**3. Epictetus as an example**
I mean come on, Epictetus has been through some awful ass shit. He is an amazing example of Stoicism at work. I have trouble following advice if the person giving the advice *only* knows the answers through theory as opposed to practical application. Epictetus completely blows that out of the water for me. If HE can do it, surely I can. 

**4. Epictetus, Discourse 1.24 “How we should struggle with circumstances”** in combination with **Discourse 1.5 “Against the Academics”**

“*It is circumstances (difficulties) which show what men are. Therefore when a difficulty falls upon you, remember that God, like a trainer of wrestlers, has matched you with a rough young man. “For what purpose?” You may say. Why, that you may become an Olympic conquerer; but it is not accomplished without sweat.*” 

“*But, you may say, there are some things disagreeable and troublesome in life. And are there none at Olympia? Are you not without comfortable means of bathing? Are you not wet when it rains? Have you not abundance of noise, clamour, and other disagreeable things? But I suppose that setting all these things off against the magnificence of the spectacle, you bear and endure. Well then and have you not received faculties by which you will be able to bear all that happens? Have you not received greatness of the soul? Have you not received manliness? Have you not received endurance? And why do I trouble myself about anything that can happen if I possess greatness of the soul? What shall distract my mind or disturb me, or appear painful? Shall I not use the power for the purposes for which I received it, and shall I grieve and lament over what happens?*” 

I have been given the faculties to deal with everything that has happened to me and everything that *can* happen to me. With that in mind, I have the knowledge that by using such faculties I am making them stronger and therefore becoming stronger myself. This, if anything, takes me RIGHT out of my suicidal episodes. Yes, the things that have happened may seem horrible, but I’ve *endured* them and grown from them. It’s like; yeah, that’s a big ass mountain, but I **climbed** that big ass mountain. THAT is what’s important. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHJHHH",Stoicism,1703303940.0,t3_18ox2tm,0.89,40
Opinion required regarding action upon urges,"This post is somewhat inspired by a post I've seen earlier regarding sexual urges and masturbation and I've gained several thinking points from the comments there. Thus i want to ask your opinion on some issues I face.

Whenever I've acted upon my sexual urges ( be it masturbation or watching content regarding that) i feel like i have wasted the day and what ever productive thing i do or new ideas i think of on that day will result in failure down the line. Its like i have marked that day as a bad omen or something.

 I know it sounds childish but I  battle everyday with myself against obsessive intrusive thoughts,ocd and procrastination. So any pointers you can provide will only help me in that fight.

I care too much about what others think of me.,"I (19F) have found myself to become increasingly overly concerned with how others perceive me and what their opinions of me are. I don't know how keep these concerns at bay. I am plagued by this fear of others disliking me or talking bad about me behind my back so much that I spend a considerable amount of time thinking about it. I am either thinking about what exactly about my personality is so off-putting or I am thinking about how I can manufacture a false personality to make myself more laid back and appealing.

A week ago, my best friend and his family, both of which I am very close to, invited me over for dinner and this wasn't the first time that this invitation was extended to me. My best friend's brother has a new girlfriend who showed up to this dinner and although me and her had barely exchanged any words beyond a hello, it was disclosed to me that this person does not like me for whatever reason. I am so confused and my mind does cartwheels trying to figure out what I did wrong when I do my best to be personable and kind to those around me. I know this is unhealthy and I shouldn't be so wrapped up in this but I can't help it. I don't know if I even like this person and there's a likely chance my friend's brother and his girlfriend will break up in due time yet I still care too much. Heck, I don't even know when's the next time I will be in the same room as this person.

This little incident is just one example of many where information was revealed to me about or I had found out by myself that a person who I thought I was cool with no longer approves of me and it's always something stupid and simple like people unfollowing me on social media, being quiet and shut down when I enter a room, ex-friends finding excuses to leave me out of plans and hang-outs, etc, etc. I understand to many, I have a strong personality, I have a bit of a potty mouth and my sense of humor is out there but never offensive and I don't let my jokes run wild around people I have just met who might not know better. These thoughts then extend to me feeling like the least favorite of every friend group or just overall an unimpressive and forgettable friend.

How do I let go of these thoughts and this pressure I put on myself to be as likable as possible to everyone I know? I always feel inadequate. I am new to stoicism and would like to put some stoic practices in my day-to-day but I am unsure of what the appropriate  response to all this is as I feel like me getting so wrapped up in my head isn't very ""stoic"".",Stoicism,1703298503.0,t3_18ovhbg,0.83,7
My social skills are terrible,"Hello, M17 here. I'm not exactly sure how to begin explaining my situation but i'll give it my best. I've always been a very quiet person, but thing is i don't think i'm a so called ""introvert"". I want to talk to people, i like it, it makes me happy to socialize with friends but the problem is i cant. I don't know how to i guess. I'm scared to talk to strangers, though this has gotten better over the last couple of years after i've convinced myself that not everyone is negatively judging me 24/7, but my stubborness of talking to strangers is somewhat still there. And to get to the main issue, I don't know how to talk, even to people i know! I simply don't know what to say when i'm talking to somone, and so when for example i'm in a group of three, i'll just end up being next to the other two listening what they say and not contributing anything to the conversation. I try to think of something to say but nothing comes out and as i've said before, i simply don't know what to say.
I'm not sure why i'm like this, but my guess is how i grew up perhaps? When i was 4 y/o me and my mom moved to a completely new country. My mother did not know a word on the language. I don't remember much of when i started school, but i do remember i did not have friends, and this was probably in 1st grade. So really i've never had many friends either. Today i only have one truely good friend whom i am able to talk to. But as i've said, when someone else joins us, i am unable to speak, yet my friend has no problems...
I even joined my local volleyball team (because i like the sport) and I would say i'm somewhat friends with like two guys, but even then we don't hang out after practice except video games. I want to be able to join them talk after practice, but i just end up looking at them.
I'm just lost at what i should do, how can i learn to talk?

TL;DR I don't know how to speak, I want to talk but whenever i try, nothing comes out of my mouth and my mind is empty.",Stoicism,1703293175.0,t3_18otskl,0.84,12
What are some good Stoic texts related to righteous indignation and not feeling anger and outrage when something doesn’t go my way?,"So I noticed I have this pattern where I get very angry when something doesn’t go my way. It feels like some great injustice has been done to me.

Rather than seeing it from a more objective perspective where it’s just a slight preference, that didn’t go my way, I get all bent out of shape and feel like it shouldn’t have gone that way, and things need to have gone differently, and I oftentimes get angry during these situations.

I’m looking for a way to change this behavior and be able to remain more levelheaded both in my behaviors outwardly, but also more importantly, in my inward feelings, as well.

I’m wondering if anyone has any stoic texts that they could recommend to me to help in this area?

Created a Self-Study Introductory Course on Stoicism,"I started reading “Daily Stoic” about a year ago, and really enjoy that is is mostly just quotes from original texts of the Stoic Philosophers. I do not really like Ryan Holiday or his anecdotes. Sometimes they are helpful for understanding the passage, but more often than not they seem pointless. So I wanted to read a mix here of modern stoic authors, while also reading some of the  primary texts. I used ChatGPT to come up with parts of this syllabus, but the texts and resources chosen are my own. Is this a good staring point? 

Course Title: Stoicism: An Exploration of Ancient Wisdom for Modern Living

Course Description:
This self-study course on Stoicism delves into the timeless principles of this ancient philosophy, providing students with a comprehensive understanding of Stoic thought and its application in contemporary life. Spanning across three credits, this course invites students on a transformative journey that combines introspection, critical analysis, and practical exercises to cultivate resilience, wisdom, and emotional well-being.
Through a carefully curated selection of texts, including the seminal works of Stoic philosophers such as Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius, students will explore the core tenets of Stoicism. They will gain practical insights into leading a life characterized by virtue, tranquility, and the pursuit of personal excellence, regardless of external circumstances.
This self-study course encourages students to actively engage with Stoic principles through a variety of mediums, including readings, video lectures, reflective journaling, and guided exercises. By fostering a sense of personal responsibility, this course empowers students to develop actionable strategies for adopting Stoic principles into their own lives.

Key areas of exploration in this course include:
1. The Stoic Mindset: Students will develop an understanding of the Stoic worldview, exploring key concepts such as virtue, nature, and personal discipline.

They will learn to observe and evaluate their own emotional responses, gaining tools to transform negative emotions into opportunities for growth, wisdom, and tranquility.
3. The Art of Acceptance: Stoicism emphasizes accepting and embracing the realities outside of our control, enabling individuals to find peace in the face of life's uncertainties. Students will examine the Stoic concept of indifference to external events and develop strategies to manage stress, overcome obstacles, and live authentically.
4. Relationships and Virtue: Stoicism places a strong emphasis on cultivating virtuous relationships. Students will explore Stoic teachings on friendship, justice, and our responsibilities towards others. They will examine how Stoic ethics can transform their approach to social interactions, enabling them to foster healthier, more meaningful relationships.
5. Stoicism in the Modern World: Applying Stoic teachings to contemporary contexts, students will explore how Stoic philosophy can inform and enhance various aspects of their lives, including career, personal goals, and decision-making.

Stoics Against Social Isolation,"I would like to discuss the stoic application of social interaction. This is in response to the frequent posts that go something like ""Due to x,y,z circumstances and events, I've decided that I'm never talking to anyone ever again, how can stoicism help me with the inevitable psychological consequences of my self-induced solitary confinement?""

I understand how someone could get an idea of the story of Seneca the Younger and him being wrongfully exiled, and I appreciate how well this story helps convey important tenants of stoicism, but I feel people run with the idea that stoicism = being alone. I also understand that Stoicism has been adopted by the ""sigma grindset"" side of social media that primarily values productivity and material success or status, which likely sends a lot of people here.

There is a concept of Oikiosis that's mostly discussed and referenced from the very early stoics like Cicero, but it's nonetheless important. My understanding of oikiosis is that it's the individual's natural instinct for self-preservation and care which extends outwards to friends and community, that helps develop an individual's moral compass. Moreover, the cardinal stoic virtue of justice does not only call for the fair treatment of others but also active contribution to the community, and this seems to be overlooked.

**In short,** if someone is dealing with a tragedy that has left them completely socially isolated, stoicism can help, but I believe, from my interpretation of the texts, that it's antithetical to stoicism to completely remove oneself from all communities. Thoughts?

**Some sources:**

""With the exception of wisdom, I'm inclined to believe that the immortal gods have given nothing better to humanity than friendship."" - Cicero

""No good thing is pleasant to possess, without friends to share it."" - Seneca

""Friendship produces between us a partnership in all our interests. There is no such thing as good or bad fortune for the individual; we live in common. And no one can live happily who has regard to himself alone and transforms everything into a question of his own utility; you must live for your neighbour, if you would live for yourself. "" - Seneca

""This is the first promise that philosophy holds out to us: fellow-feeling, humanity, sociability."" — Seneca

""Nature bore us related to one another … She instilled in us a mutual love and made us compatible … Let us hold everything in common; we stem from a common source. Our fellowship is very similar to an arch of stones, which would fall apart, if they did not reciprocally support each other"" - Seneca",Stoicism,1703274255.0,t3_18on6um,0.84,8

Does anyone else get massively dissapointed in themselves when they react based off emotion? How do you deal with that?,"Hi everyone,

How do you guys deal with reacting based off emotion?

 Lately I have been having kinda shitty days (I know this isnt an excuse) and I just sometimes do things that I very am dissapointed in.

For example just today when I was cycling back from the gym I see a family standing in the middle of the cycling lane like dumbasses. Now here's the bit im dissapointed in,  I gave the guy (I assume the dad) kinda like a death stare. Not a massive big deal I know but still.

What good does that do? Nothing. Will that prevent them from doing that again? Probably not. Will I get my ass beat if I do that to the wrong guy? Possibly. Maybe they didnt even know that they were on a cycling lane.  I immidietly after that was so dissapointed in myself. Like dude are you a baby?

I know that I am in control of my own actions/reactions. I cant control what others do or say. Some people are just not very thoughtful,(?) of others. Not everyone has the same norms and values. Maybe they were even new to the country and dont even know how the traffic rules work. I should pity them and not react in a hateful manner. But sometimes its just so grrrr, you know?

Hence Agrippinus,[9](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0237%3Atext%3Ddisc%3Abook%3D1#note9) when Florus was deliberating whether he should go to Nero's shows, and perform some part in them himself, bid him go. ""But why do not you go, then? "" says Florus. "" Because,"" re- \[p. 1011\] plied Agrippinus, "" I do not deliberate about it."" For he who once sets himself about such considerations, and goes to calculating the worth of external things, approaches very near to those who forget their own character. Why, then, do you ask me whether death or life be the more eligible? I answer, life. Pain or pleasure? I answer, pleasure. "" But if I do not act a part, I shall lose my head."" Go and act it, then, but I will not. ""Why?"" Because you esteem yourself only as one thread of many that make up the piece. ""What then?""

Understanding my own meditations,"I am fairy new to Stoicism I have been trying to write out conversations I have in my head in order to better understand myself and my emotions. I'm hoping with my recent studies of Stoicism, I am able to apply the values into my thoughts. I'd love to hear any feedback or to add some Stoic wisdom to better relate to yourself.

Why am I such an emotionally sensitive individual?

It feels like I don’t know how to take anything as a joke anymore. I used to brush everything off and laugh about it, but now I don’t know how to respond. 

No one is truly joking about anything they say. There is always some sense of truth behind their words. 

\- But people do joke, you have just been accustomed to bullying.

“I don’t see much you bring to the table other than constant sensitivity”

\- See? Bully.

Why cant a man be emotional without being ridiculed? Humans are designed to have emotion, it’s what allows you to express your soul. Men are told to remain unobstructed by any of life's mishaps. 

\- Correct. You must still allow yourself to process your own emotional reactivity to the thoughts following a specific event. 

Yes; however, we are still ridiculed for our emotions. The insecurities of others leaks out of them as they bark at  you for being able to be honest and open with yourself and your emotions. 

\- Then leave them as they were. Their thoughts and emotions don't pertain to you.  ",Stoicism,1703212842.0,t3_18o4hab,0.99,1

How to stop hating somebody and be stoic?,"Had an ugly falling out with a ""friend"" about nine months ago.  (He accused me of doing something I didn't do, and refused to accept my explanation.)

My hatred of him was infinite for awhile, and thankfully it's gotten at least a little better in recent weeks.  But plenty of hatred remains.

What's still holding me back from letting go completely?  I still have to see this person every week, because he works at a restaurant my husband & I frequent.  Obviously we aren't going to boycott the restaurant over this, but I do look forward to the day that he no longer works there.

Of the people I've actually known, my list of folks I absolutely loathe isn't very long:  An ex-boss, my brother, and the devil incarnate kid who came up from behind me when I was six years old and shoved my head into a tire rim just because.  Fortunately I no longer have to see any of them, so they (mostly) stay out of mind because they're far out of sight.

But I still have some rage when I encounter the jerk at the restaurant.  I wish nothing but bad things for him -- which isn't stoic, and I'm not proud of it.  I think my continued anger stems from the fact that at the time of kerfuffle, I could have really let him have it and told him off.  I didn't, and now it's too late.

Maybe the fact that I didn't tell him off was a form of stoicism?  I don't know.  But I'm really curious how some of you get so stoic that you can 100% tune out someone you despise, when that person is sometimes just a few feet away from you.  How do you do it?",Stoicism,1703207744.0,t3_18o2tqp,0.91,20

ps: i'm asking because i want to understand this lesson better cause throught my whole life i always said and done stupid things especially (the problem of saying stupid things and doing them only occurs when i'm around my family and that makes me so sad idk why really i really love my family and respect them.) when i'm around my family, said things i regret saying and doing. so i think this lesson if done correctly and practiced could help make me a better person. and i don't know why i'm so foolish around my family. but it is what it is.

"Successful reframing of ""negative"" emotional reactions.","Ive recently had a light bulb moment regarding negative emotional reactions. 

A year ago I became aware of the childhood emotional neglect I faced growing up. I was completely burnt out and was unable to function at the caliber I had become accustomed to and expected from myself. This lead me to discovering CPTSD, followed by Stoicism. I'm sure the emotional neglect contributed to my negative emotional reactions, so this might seem more obvious to some.

Over the last year I would seem to grasp the Stoic philosophy, taking control over my negative emotional reactions but then a particular hardship would come along and trigger me, and make my understanding and practice of Stoicism become muddled and confusing. 

If someone was taking advantage of me or if someone was criticizing me unfairly I would become upset. I would try to work through this by telling myself ""don't worry about things that are out of my control"", ""how I respond is what's important, not what someone does"", ""judge myself on how I'm acting, don't project my morals onto others"", ""be kind to them, they are not intending to be mean, they're just ignorant"". Etc etc. Despite reading and reminding myself of Stoic philosophy, after each challenging situation I would still be upset inside. I was still feeling upset by the actions of others. I didn't know how to truly believe something that I didnt like, wasn't a negative. I also felt complacent, as if I wasn't standing up for myself in these situations. I couldn't make it all come together neatly and calmly in my mind and my gut. 

But then it hit me. How I'm viewing the hardship/unfavorable action is all wrong. I had been trying to deflect my negative reactions by looking inward for comfort, when I should have been looking inward to change my perspective. 

Below I've outlined 2 examples of my reframing and what response it yields. 

""Someone is taking advantage of me"" becomes ""someone is doing something I don't like"". Instead of having a negative emotional reaction to being taken advantage of, I now have the option to simply and matter of fact-ly communicate my needs and expectations or remove myself from the situation. Saying I am being taken advantage of is a judgement/assumption I am making of their behaviour/intention, and it makes me a victim. That's a tough pill to swallow. It comes from my own expectations of how others should act, it comes from my ego. Removing the judgement statement makes it much easier for me to respond rationally. 

""Someone is judging/criticizing me"" becomes ""i dont agree with someone's opinion of me"". Again, instead of viewing myself negatively through their eyes, which causes me to become defensive, I am simply saying we disagree on the topic, that their truth isn't THE truth. I can either express my views in a virtuous manner, agree to disagree, or consider their perspective and aim to improve if needed. My internal dialog switched from labeling myself as the problem, to labeling the problem as the problem. 

I would love hear more ""negative emotional reactions/judgements = neutral statement replacement"" that others can think of!",Stoicism,1703199062.0,t3_18nzowk,0.99,18

Loving Evil People," Reading The Meditations, Marcus Aurelius says that the height of all logic that all stoics should seek out is loving every last human being.

However, I don't understand how I can possibly love someone like Hitler or Leopold II or other people like them who are undoubtedly horrific monsters. I understand that people are a product of their environment, but at a certain point you are making a willing choice to continue down a path of moral corruption. I can have faith that people can change, but many people (like Hitler and Leopold) will never change. How and why is it important to love those who spread hatred and death?

Eternal Return and Free Will.,"Hi!
I found the concept of Eternal Return which was practiced by Stoics, especially the earliest ones. I have got a question. 
So, according to the theory of eternal return, time is cyclical, it repeats itself and according to some posts I've seen here, it all happens over again, the same way it was before, so I understood that if there is a Glad_Communications posting this today, there was another Glad_Communications in the past cycle and there will be another one in the future cycles. And as far as my studies in Stoicism work, then nature is deterministic, which means that there are things which will inevitably happen, but we have some degree of free will according to the knowledge we have and will have, so... in that way, isn't then determinism and eternal return mutually exclusive? Because nature then would then be pre-deterministic.",Stoicism,1703177066.0,t3_18nraab,0.67,2

Can someone explain this to me in a better way than I’m currently understanding it? It seems to me like there should be no enjoyment or emotion in life other than virtue.

I just got fired,"My life couldn’t get any more unfortunate lol.

I missed a shift a few weeks ago because of a technical error that didn’t notify me that I was scheduled for that day. My supervisor notified me of this and I assured her it wouldn’t happen again but there was literally no way I could have prevented this.

Fast foward to a couple weeks later and I’m scheduled for a shift that conflicts with my unavailability (another technical issue). On the day before my shift starts (2 hours in advance) I let my supervisor know that I won’t be able to attend because of a competition. She responds 4 hours later and because of competition rules, I can’t use my phone and respond to her in a timely manner. I see her message a few hours later asking me to come in late but I see that it’s past the time of the shift. Here’s where I know I messed up- I eventually end up not followingup with her as I believe it would be better just to leave things as is since I thought the situation was under control.

I message her a few days after that regarding a question and everything seems cool, no mention of any issues regarding the whole situation or anything like that. Then, I receive an email on Monday saying that I’m being terminated for my low availability (this was the topic of the question i messaged to her) and that I’ve had two no-shows with little communication.

I feel like I properly communicated for the first one and I see my mistake in the second but I just can’t help but feel a bit distraught.

Stressed about money and future and status and happiness,"NOTE: I have ADHD and Crohn's, which I think influences why I feel this way. I'm posting here because I've found Stoicism helpful in the past and I think people here will have a unique perspective on this. 

&#x200B;

I naturally stay up late and wake up late. When I don't have external demands on me, I tend to sleep between 2am and 4am and wake up between 10am and 1pm. 

Obviously, when I was in school, I had to be there from 8-4 ish every day (well, excluding the large amount of days I skipped or left at lunch or showed up after lunch). I honestly can't remember how I did it. I think I was usually just groggy and annoyed for a few hours and then felt better as the day went on. 

After college, I tried to work various jobs that started in the morning, around 8 or 9. I quit all of them relatively quickly because I just hated getting up so early. I hated feeling rushed. I hated not having time to eat breakfast or have coffee or tea. I hated driving to work in rush hour traffic. 

After a couple years I went to Korea to teach in an afterschool English academy. My hours were 3pm-10pm ish. It was awesome. I'd get up, enjoy my morning, go for a hike or something, eat lunch, and head to class feeling good. My job was fun and I was good at it. Then I'd relax at night or walk around or whatever I wanted and just go to sleep when I felt tired. 

The problem is as I'm getting older I'm a bit stressed about money and the future and all that stuff. My job in Korea provided a free apartment, but the salary wasn't much. I could save a few hundred dollars a month if I tried. I came back to the US after 2 years with about 4 grand. 

I applied to a bunch of jobs in the US. The two interviews I got were car salesman (which sounded terrible and would have me working like 10 hours a day) and concessions at the movie theater (which I took and I'm enjoying, but obviously the money is very little). 

I've thought about ways I could make more money and I basically came up with 3 options. 

1) Do something online like writing or making videos or learning to code- This would be good because of flexibility, but it's hard to predict whether you will be successful. Also, I tend to get down if I don't socialize for awhile. I get energy from being around people and I don't know if I could be happy sitting in my room for 8 hours a day. 

2) Become a ""real"" teacher- This would require me to get a teaching license and/or masters degree. I could potentially end up working in international schools, which sounds cool. They also get paid a lot better than academy teachers. But from what I've heard, you generally have to spend 2 years teaching in the US or an undesirable country before you get a job somewhere I'd want to live. I really don't want to do that. And honestly, I don't want to go back to the school schedule, waking up at 6 or 7am. And I don't want to teach big classes, like 30-40 kids. The max at my old job was 12 and even that felt a bit much to me. 

3) Go to law school- I did well in debate, majored in philosophy, and got a good score on a practice LSAT. I think I have the skills to excel in this. But working as a lawyer requires a 9-5 type job (or worse if you want to make a lot of money). And also I think a lot of it will be boring and tedious and ethically grey, which I don't like. When I think about it, I did well in debate, but it also stressed me out a lot and I could get mad when judges were stupid or people were mean to me. 

&#x200B;

So, as you can see, I have no idea what to do next haha. I think two of the biggest things holding me back are not wanting to work a ""normal"" schedule or live in places I don't want to live in. To be honest, what I want to do is go back to working in an academy in Korea. I think I was the happiest I've ever been there and I miss it. But I'm scared of not making much money as I get older. 

I don't really care much about money myself. I really wish I didn't have to think about it. I kind of hate thinking about it. But it's important for security, in case of emergencies or what not. And I'm worried about my ability to date or get married as I get older if I don't start making more money. Most girls I dated in my 20's didn't seem to care, but will they if I'm in my 30s and still not making a lot? 

Anyone relate to this or have any advice? 

My dad wants me to go to law school and I think my mom wants me to get a masters in education, but I think I might end up hating either one. I want to go back to teaching in an academy, but I'm worried and feel I might be embarrassed to still be doing that in my 30s. I turn 30 in October.

How would stoics view modernity?,"
Modern day hook up culture plaguing the youth, wide spread availability of drugs, instant pleasure at our finger tips, no real commitments to anything, hyper active behavior everywhere, no real search for meaning, feminization of men, wide spread obesity, being a father or mother is seen as a ""waste"", lust and greed driven, etc...

I could go on with hundreds more but you clearly get the picture.

Before you say, ""that's a minority group and your spending to much time on social media...🤓"" I agree it is a minority, however, I lump it all together to create what I would consider a small majority group, or at least maybe that's where it's heading.

I dont really consume any social media and I'm not some old guy behind the times. I'm really young and I just like philosiphy.

Is this Stoicism?,"I read a book by the famous historical polymath ibn Hazm and something in my mind says its stoic.

He wrote:

""These words encapsulate all 
virtue: to control oneself against passion means in fact to turn 
away from one’s natural tendency towards anger and lust, 
things which are both under the dictates of passion. Then all 
that is left for the soul to use is the intellect which God has 
given it, the good sense which distinguishes it from the beasts, 
from insects or vermin and from tigers. “Never lose your 
temper,” as Allah’s Prophet (peace be upon him) said to a 120
man asking advice, and, as he also said commanding him, “Do 
as you would be done by” , together encapsulate the whole of 121
virtue


He further writes about the goal of all humans and all nations, 
“I have tried to find one goal which everyone would agree to be 
excellent and worthy of being striven after. I have found one 
only: to be free from anxiety. When I reflected upon it, I 
realized that not only do all agree in valuing it and desiring it, 
but I also perceived that, despite their many different passions 
and aspirations and preoccupations and desires, they never 
make the slightest gesture unless it is designed to drive anxiety 
far away. One man loses his way, another comes close to going 
wrong, finally another is successful - but he is a rare man, and 
success is rare, (O all-knowing Allah). Dispelling anxiety is a 
goal upon which all nations agree from the time when the 
Almighty created the world until the day when this world will 
pass away and be followed by the Day of Judgment - and their 
actions are directed to this goal alone. In the case of every 
other objective there will always be some people who do not 
desire it. For example, some people are not religious and do 
not take eternity into account. There are some who by nature 
and inclination prefer obscurity to fame [the obscurity of 
satisfied passion]. There are some who have no interest in 
amassing a fortune, preferring abstinence to ownership; this 
was the case with many of the Prophets. May peace be upon 
them all - and those who followed their example, ascetics and 
philosophers. There are some who by nature dislike sensual 
pleasures and scorn those who seek after them, such as those 
men we have just mentioned, and who prefer to lose a fortune 
rather than gain one. Some prefer ignorance to knowledge, in 
fact most of the people that you see in the street are like this. 
These are the objectives of people who have no other aim in 
life. Nobody in the whole world, from the time of its creation 
until its end, would deliberately choose anxiety, and would not 
desire to drive it far away. When I had arrived at this great 
piece of wisdom, when I had discovered this amazing secret, 
when Allah the Almighty had opened the eyes of my mind.


it should refrain from this passion, and the [Prophet’s] 
commandment to do as you would be done implies that the 
souls should turn away from the strong force of greed and lust 
and should uphold the authority or the means of justice which 
springs from the rationality which is part of the reasonable soul. 
I have seen the majority of people - except those who God the 
Almighty has protected, and they are few - throw themselves 
into the miseries, the worries and fatigues of this world, and 
pile up a mountain of sin which will mean that they enter 
hellfire in the Hereafter and will have no advantage from the 
perfidious intentions which they nurse so carefully, such as 
wishing for an inflation of prices which would bring disaster 
upon the children, the innocent, or wishing the worst trials 
upon those they hate. They know very well that these bad 
intentions will not necessarily bring about what they desire or 
guarantee its advent, and if they clarified and improved their 
intentions they would hasten the repose of their spirits. They 
would then have the time to devote themselves to their own 
business and would thus profit a great deal in addition to the 
return of their souls to God, and all this without having at all 
hastened or delayed the realization of their desires. Is there any 
worse deception than the attitude which we warn against here, 
and is there any greater happiness than the one which we are 
promoting?”122

Need help understanding,"Hello all, I'm 25(M) new to these pracitices. I would like to say right away I know reddit is not the best place to come to for advice. I feel lost, alone and not understood. Posting here as i don't really know what else to do other than seek anonymous help and what others opinions are. 

I have a really hard time either processing emotions or understanding them. I messed up yesterday and freaked out, all because I felt like an idiot because I kept pushing a place to go for vacation that people couldn't afford. Was not upset about that at all, more so because I was embarrassed and feel bad they didn't tell me and told my brother. It doesn't even make sense. I'm trying to figure out why I get like this. I'm starting to think I have emotional baggage that I haven't processed yet that causes me to act this way. My confidence is so low already and always feeling so unsure about myself might be a root cause?

I want to start learning and practicing stoicism so I can control my emotions. An old friend told me a couple months ago that I used to be so happy and care free. Didn't really hit me till now that they are right. I also think because I gained weight back that I lost 5 years ago that I'm not feeling myself.

Dichotomy on Control as an argument about Identity,"Here is something I've been considering that I wanted to get the community's opinion on. I think that the dichotomy of control is better understood as an argument about **identity** (what we fundamentally are), than an argument about control, influence, or cause. 

The Handbook introduces the Dichotomy of control as follows: ""Some things are within our power, while others are not. Within our power are opinion, motivation, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever is of our own doing; not within our power are our body, our property, reputation, office, and, in a word, whatever is not of our own doing."" ( Handbook 1.1 Hard Translation).

Most people take this to mean that there are three things are play:

1. Us (who we are)
2. The things up to us (Opinion, motivation, desire)
3. The things not up to us (body, our property, reputation).

Instead, I think the argument is better thought of as this:   
1. There are the things that we ARE, that make up our identity (our opinions and desires).  
2. There are the things that we ARE NOT, that don't make up our identity (our body, our reputation).

Therefore, we should focus on improving and caring about what we fundamentally are. Our life goes better when WE are better (better opinions, better desires). Our life does not go worse when things WE ARE NOT get damaged (our office, our property). The DOC then is not about describing what we can or can't control, but about where the limits of our identity lie, which technically for Epictetus is our Prohairesis (our faculty of choice).

It is a change in the emphasis of the argument. Epictetus is not *just* saying that we suffer when we try to control what is outside our control (although that is true). He is emphasizing that we suffer when we identify ourselves with the things that are not up to us. When we think something belongs to us (is up to us) that doesn't.

This is why in Discourses 1.1 Epictetus focuses so much on personal identity. He presents an example with a tyrant: ""'Tell me your secrets.' I won't reveal them; for that lies within my power. 'Then I'll have you chained up.' What are you saying, man, chain *me* up? You can chain my leg, but not even Zeus can overcome my power of choice (prohairesis). 'I'll throw you into prison.' You mean my poor body.""

The humour in this passage is that the tyrant is trying to threaten Epictetus, but the tyrant is applying a non-Stoic perspective. He is threatening Epictetus' body, but Epictetus realizes that he is not his body and so he is not intimidated. He is his character, his prohairesis, his capacity to make choices. That is what applying the Dichotomy of control looks like in action, not just saying ""oh well, I can't control what you do."".

How to avoid letting stoicism cause dismissiveness?,"“What can I do about my brothers anger?”

Nothing. You can do nothing about it. But you can control your response to his anger” I.e. don’t get angry just because he’s angry

This is true and it’s valuable to focus on not letting other people’s reactions cause you to react in a similar way

But at the same time, this feels pretty black and white. Maybe you can help your brother with his anger by asking what’s going on to cause it, maybe you did something that understandably contributed to his anger, and it’s unfair for you to say “hm his anger is his own problem, nothing I can do”. 

I guess what I’m asking is this: it seems that taking stoic lessons perfectly literally can cause some unfavorable interpersonal dynamics. Do you agree or disagree?",Stoicism,1703077627.0,t3_18mu6dh,0.82,10
I feel guilty and scared of my emotional responses,"Yesterday I had what started as a funny argument on a random topic. My sister and my husband had an opposite view as mine and both of them where interrupting me while I was trying to speak. I said “Shut the fuck up” which was meant in a jokingly way but my face showed my frustration of being repeatedly interrupted. They both said wow that’s not cool and I apologised on the spot. My sister got really triggered and threw in my face that I cry when someone tells me something that hurts my feelings but I say things like that when I am angry. Also I confess that lately I feel very emotional when I see my sister and my husband “coming together “ against me.

The point is that she has a point. I am a very sensitive person, I get emotional very easily and I just want to stop reacting. I feel like I always says something wrong and I feel terrible and insecure afterwards. I feel like I am a bad person for having these reactions. It looks like everyone can be cool and easy going but me, like I am always making mistakes and that the people I love will get tired of me.

Should I avoid confrontation? How can I be a better, wiser person? How do I deal with my insecurities?

I write this in this page because I am trying to learn stoicism. I spend most of my days alone at home and I feel happy and at peace. Then I am tested with actual people, and people are just hard form me. Any stoic material suggestions are appreciated.

What should a stoic define as true power?,"I'm in a career which gives me a lot of responsibility and authority but it tends to become fairly political. Due to this, mentors and advisors frequently recommend books like The Prince or the 48 Laws of Power. However, these books don't align with the values of a stoic and are ruthlessly pragmatic. I'm not sure how to incorporate the understanding I have gathered from these while maintaining my character.
The question I want to explore is how should I view power as a stoic, especially when the choices I make effect the lives of others. I literally hold people's lives in my hands due to my career, so do I owe it to them to be as ruthlessly pragmatic as possible?
Do I play the game and behave disingenuously, even if it goes again the principles of Stoicism?",Stoicism,1703041770.0,t3_18mkciy,0.76,8
Talk only when needed?,"After countless conversations I had with people, I am thinking about not getting involved in conversations.

Whenever I try to have a conversation, I try to be as close to reality as possible, instead of having my opinions or my conditioning. People most often take it offensive and project their hatred towards me.

Some people try to shut me off by saying I sound like a philosopher. Some people appreciate it though. 

It feels exhausting. I start to question why do I even have these conversations in the first place.

People often can't really accept reality. I don't know every truth ever. But I can perceive it to some extent.

To me a conversation is about exchange of information to learn and grow. There is some amount of egoic identity involved as well personally. I am not going to deny it. Still learning to not take it personally when I am defeated and trying to learn from it. 

I right now feel like I only need to talk when there is something gonna change if I contribute to the conversation. If things are not going to change, then why even take part in the conversation? 

If both the parties learn and grow, then it's fine. Or else observation and silence is better I guess.

Preparation for starvation," This may seem somewhat  pessimistic, but after deep consideration I realize this is a more likely issue I'm going to face in the future. Currently my families financial situation is mid at the moment. There's me, my mom and my grandfather. Truth be told we're solely dependent on my grandfather's pension. My mother is a housewife with only a high-school diploma. I passed my graduation and I have been trying for job for 6 years but to no hope whatsoever in the horizon. I did a lot of odd jobs and with recession in the country lost the current job I have. I'm have been trying for quite some time but it's to no avail. We have been rationing a lot of our food, but with grandfather's advance age and all and his medical bills, it seems it not enough. He's well psst 90 and he's have a lot of co morbidity. If he dies we can manage for a while but after a year or so we'll be dead broke. To prepare myself for that likely future I have been trying to prepare myself for stark starvation by eating a meal a day. Sometimes even no meals. I have been doing it for quite a few months now.

"Loved Meditations, STRUGGLING with Discourses","I read the Hayes translations of Meditations and loved it.  I then went to the Haward Morse audiobook of Discourses (Gregory Long translation.)  I'm STRUGGLING, with entire sentences, paragraphs passing by with little comprehension. The heavy English accent and old translation, combined with the fact that I consume these as audiobooks while doing long distance running, has me wondering if I'm wasting my time (7.5 more hours to go).

I'm trying to decide do I:

1. Quit, start over with a new translation and narrator, or
2. Suffer through it, or
3. Quit entirely and instead read a modern distillation of Stoicism (""The Daily Stoic"" or other)?

Thoughts?

\[Update (12/24/23): I finished the G. Long translation of Discourses and have started the Dobbins translation (Penguin Classic).  One thing I happy to notice is how much sounds familiar. I absorbed a lot more from the G. Long translation than I thought. I like the modern (Dobbins) translation a lot better. I'm getting a tremendous amount out of it.

"I need good advice from some stoic men, because i dont know what will happen to me now, im getting death threats in highschool","So around two weeks ago, my life was going well, my self esteem was rising from a shit 2022, and i thought i was out of the ringer. Then all that hope was thrashed into peices. bassically this kid that i was sort of friends with made this rumor about me saying that i leaked his home adress. This was a blow as i thought this kid was my friend. Then my popualarity and reputation that i once had crumbled. I thought this was the deepest pit of hell a man can face, all his friends who he realises are fake leaving him, although it got worse, so much more worse. Then he added  me to this group chat on snapchat and got this kid to threaten me and press me, no matter how much i tried to explain they would not understamd the truth. They forced me to confess to somthing i did not do under the threat of a beating. And i thought that that was it, it got worse, this was probably the first time i experienced real trauma, and im only a highschooler. They added me to another chat with 15 other kids, who were all gang affiliated although in highschool and they threatened me, harrased me and even said they would stab me. Those thoughts keep me up at night. Anyways i kept this all to myself, my pearents did not need added stress, and i was forced to pay these people 20$ to let me live. It got worse, the next weekend i had a family gathering, in wich took my mind of taht trauma, on monday i checked my snapchat, apparently over the weekend i was placed in another groupchat with even more kids, giving more death threats to me. the things they said made my shiver, i gave one $20 now they all wanted up to 50$ saying they wanted a new vape or a new knife. But when they did not get a response from me as i was busy with the gathering and hanging out with my cousins. They moved on to 3 other kids, pressing them, death threating them, they sent images of their guns and knives and vapes to them, and even took $50 from them. I could not let this slide, i had to make sure this would nto happen again, i got another phone and recorded the whole conversation,this way they would not know i collected this. That should atleast send them to juvie right?

Observation from Beyond Good and Evil regarding criticism of Stoicism,"I am working my way through Beyond Good and Evil for the first time. In book two, Nietzsche goes on a tirade against a few different philosophies - including Stoicism. In it, he mocked the Stoics for wanting to live in accord with nature and basically said the Stoics imprint their own morality onto nature this way and that nature is ultimately indifferent. 

Then, later in book III he is talking about religious people and specifically about Christianity in Europe. In this section he says:

“Then, during the moral epoch of mankind, one sacrificed to one’s God one’s own strongest instincts, one’s “nature“: this festive joy lights up the cruel eyes of the aesthetic, the “anti-natural” enthusiast.”


Seems to me like this definition of nature that he claims is being sacrificed is rather close to the Stoic idea of acting within one’s own nature. To “live according to one’s nature” as I understand it (correct me if I am wrong) means, broadly for humans, living in according with what makes humans unique - their ability to reason. 


Does it seem like his argument about sacrificing one’s nature seems to go against the argument he made against stoicism? In my reading it seems like he miss-characterized what “nature” is in the stoic context and then, albeit loosely, admitted to the existence of “nature” in the form the stoics use by conceding some people do sacrifice their nature.

Tochange thoughts or actions?,"In a recent post, u/home_iswherethedogis commented:

>The only solution to cognitive dissonance is to change your actions. Sure, you can change your beliefs (opinions) about cigarettes to ""oh, I'm young, I'll worry about my lungs later,"" but this will keep you stuck in smoking because you can't change a habit without changing the belief surrounding it. 

Id like to discuss this specific part further. For this given example, in the end clinically smoking is bad for humans. The resolutions given when boiled down were change thoughts or change actions.

In a different case: Maybe someone percieves that their work environment is rather hostile to them. When in reality, everyone thinks they're mediocre at worst. They could change their actions in the form of a job change, or change the way they perceive the work environment.

Point being, if one decides to change something, how do they decide on how to change? Maybe this dips a little too far into the ""Stoicism is not a replacement for therapy"", maybe I'm getting too far into the weeds of it and it really is as simple as ""it depends""

I can’t cry anymore.,"Hi everyone,

I am on my stoicism journey since one and a half year. I love the idea of controlling myself, my thoughts, my emotions & my actions. Sometimes I am driven by external circumstances, but I think that I am making a great progress in quickly realising what is under my control and what is not.

The reason:
Since 2 months I am experiencing a downfall of my relationship. I know my faults, I know what I did wrong, and I am taking a full responsibility of changing those things. Simply saing - my fault is that I was controlling. 

But everything seems that there is nothing left to save - my woman is extremely passive-agressive towards me, almost to the point that I question my own humanity. She makes me feel like a monster. Someone that is not worth fighting for.

I live in a constant state of alert, wondering when the day of saying goodbye comes. One day everything seems fine, and the second day she strikes me right in my heart. And yet, I don’t feel sad. I don’t know how to blame her for being shitty because I know her behaviour is not under my control. At the same time I can’t stop loving her, because I see those good days we have had.

She might be doing this to break me & make me pull the trigger first, so I will be a „bad” one in this relationship. The one that decided to left. Or she might be testing me if I am all into really changing my behaviour.

The question:
The thing that bothers me the most is that I used to be a very emotional man, but I can’t dive into my feelings anymore. I used to cry when I was upset or sad, but I can’t do it anymore. I just can’t. And I know everything would be much easier for me if I could. 

Can it be an early stage of depression? What the #%@! should I do? What the virtuous, spiritual man would do being in my place? I know some things, but I definitely don’t know what to do in that exact situation. God, please, give me strength & courage to do the right thing.",Stoicism,1702941541.0,t3_18lmq9q,0.74,2
I feel an immense amount of guilt over kicking my brother out of my house after renting a room from me for 3 years.,"We are still talking, we are still on as good of terms as we could be on. He’s moved in with our parents. We’ve been fighting on and off for about a year and a half. About 7 months ago I told him he needs to find a new place, Listing the damage he’s done to my house and the constantly struggling to keep up with rent. Well on Monday we got into a fight. I told him he should find another place to stay once he got belligerent. I suspect drugs or alcohol may have been involved. On his way out he threw a bag through my front window (it’s a huge window that takes up the entire wall). I told him he’s not welcomed back after that. I don’t know why I feel so much guilt over this. I think I’ve made the right decision. Please let me know your thoughts.",Stoicism,1702933738.0,t3_18ljmpy,0.94,24
Explaining Mortality and Death To Small Kids,"Curious to get some perspective. 

My five year old son will make a wish blowing out a birthday candle or something and I always tell him I hope all his wishes come true.  The other day he said, he has a wish that he know won't come true and then whispered ""I don't want to die"".  He then said he also doesn't want me or other family members to die.  

It's odd how over the past several years studying stoicism I've just fallen into the habit of contemplating my mortality and that of my loved ones on a near daily basis.  This might sound incredibly depressing to some, but it's really not.  Rather I see it as just being aware of how nature works and it also gives perspective into what I think is important to do with the present moment.  It's also amazing how this habit has cleared up some fears and self-doubt, but I digress.  

I've gotten into the habit of thinking before I speak.  I think it's a good habit, otherwise I might have said something like: ""you're right, we're all going to die eventually and that's just how things work but try to not let it bother you"" or some other thing that probably wouldn't really be beneficial for either of us.  Instead I just said ""it's important to focus on the time we have right now and enjoy the present moment of being here with each other"" and gave him a big hug.  

I feel like I somewhat avoided the question and have been thinking of other ways that I could respond, so appreciate any other perspectives.  

Thanks!

Then, three days ago, we were at the same party with our band and I got blackout drunk (although this kind of behaviour is not usual for me). 

Afterwards, I found out directly from her that I wanted to talk with her about us, although she did not, and that I behaved like a condescending jerk. She did not want to elaborate further, simply stating 'drunk men's words are sober man's thoughts', so I don't know my behaviour specificaly (and I really fear it could have been even worse). Of course I apologized and promised it won't happen again, giving myself a word I will further limit my occasional alcohol consumption. However, I have never thought I could behave like this and feel that I have deeply let myself down.

A visualization/realization I've been having,"I thought I would share this in hopes sometime else has success with it.

I've studied Taoism in the past, and although I find it really similar to Stoicism, they go about things so differently.  Taoism seems to focus on truly accepting the things we can't change, while stoicism focuses on making the changes we with what we have.

With Taoism, I would do meditations where I imagined having an energy/chi inside me providing me with stability and warmth.  It's been very relaxing and calming to do this, especially while anxious.  So I decided to see how I could apply this to Stoicism.

When I think about what I can really change, it comes down to literally moving my hands, getting up, etc. way more than making money out something abstract as that.  So with that, I've been imagining the same ball of energy I used to keep on the inside, but just barely outside of me.  The gravity of it almost pulls me to motion and helps me see I am in control of myself completely and not ""stuck to the couch"" or whatever.

As a last note, these are purely meditations and figments of the imagination.  I see visualisation of my chi as similar to a *dogmata* or *mantra*, not something real or tangible.",Stoicism,1702876503.0,t3_18l0zkb,0.6,1

How to deal with expectations of recognition for doing the right thing?,"I've been interested in stoicism for a few years, and although I wouldn't say I'm an avid student of it, I do try to implement the stoic virtues and practices in my life.

By doing this, I find that often I choose the path of righteousness, of forgiveness, and seldom do I seek revenge or do evil.

My problem, however, is that I keep expecting recognition for doing such things. I feel like I deserve congratulations for making the rigth choices and doing the right acts. And I realize this corrupts my initial intentions as a whole. To the point where I can't tell when I'm doing good because I am virtuous and when I'm doing it to be percieved as good and mature.

To give you an example, I recently ended a friends with benefits kind of relationship, and this person is now dating my best friend. Note that I told my friend beforehand that if he was interested in her, I wouldn't be a problem and he could go for it. I had also told her during our arrangement that if she was interested in him, it would be okay, and she could just tell me and we'd end our relationship for the sake of theirs (because I didn't want a commitment with her, and they both wanted it).

She did not tell me she was interested, but she showed clear signs. She was quite disrespectful and hurtful to me a few times due to her inability to perceive and communicate her feelings. And I just did what was best for me and ended things between us.

And now, all I can fathom is that I made their relationship possible, and I feel like both her and my friend should thank me for it.

How do I get rid of this expectation? I've been reading Meditations but to no avail thus far.

"Not sure what the point of this post is, maybe just to get things off my mind."," 

Im a 20-year-old guy who recently wrapped up my gap year with a lot of hard work. Despite earning good money, I didn't save any. I spent it on a car and started but never finished my driving license. Now, the car sits unused, and another insurance payment is coming up.

Most of my earnings went into partying and, unfortunately, drugs. Thankfully, I've kicked that habit and don't feel the urge anymore—except when I drink, which is rare now. I've started university but missed three months of classes. I want to contact university about my situation but im scared they will kick me out for not doing any work at all. I like my course and the topics, but I can't bring myself to engage. I label myself as lazy, but when I attempt something, I can't seem to enjoy it.

While I hesitate to say I'm depressed, I feel lost. I enjoy life, people, even the ""bad"" ones, but I struggle to like myself or work on self-improvement. I have a wonderful girlfriend, and I know I'm smart, but when things start improving, I feel out of place, and they take a downturn again.

Two years ago, I lost my dad to alcohol, went through a breakup, and lost a friend, all in one year. Looking back, that seems to be when things started spiraling, and im not looking for an excuse, i cannot control that. 

I often compare myself to my successful sister, measuring my worth by materialistic standards, despite knowing it's not a healthy approach.

Today, my MacBook screen broke, adding to my stress as repairs will strain my already dead budget, but life continues with or with out. I'm not sure if this post even makes sense, but I felt the need to write and seek constructive criticism or just an understanding ear. It's strange—I know what I need to do, but I'm just not doing it. I'm trying, but it's all so confusing. This may sound like a cry for help, and I'm aware of that. I appreciate stoicism and the people here, and I just wanted to unload my thoughts.

If most of this doesnt make sense, dont worry, it doesnt in my head also.

"A question about Risk, its worthiness and untimely death","Hello, 
I've been thinking of taking up some activities ( motorcycling, horse riding , a career that's risky in terms of mortality) that are sort of risky but am afraid of doing them for fear of injury or worse.

All my life I've erred on the side of caution, taking only calculated risks where the risks seems worthy enough, if the possibility of danger was even nominal I'd back off ( for example, i recently decided not to do river rafting). I am not lacking in courage but feel it best only to take risks that are ""worth it"".

Now I've been through some of the writings of George RR Martin and while its fiction in it a good number of characters -- good and bad die in the both unexpected and gruesome ways never fulfilling their destiny or their potential for great and noble things.

It also reminded me of Alexander The Great who wanted to conquer the world but died of Malaria, the second of the Mughal conquerers Humayan who died -- by falling from stairs in a library! 

The last great Hindu king who came from nothing but died from a single stray arrow hitting the only small single gap in his armor, Christopher reeves who fell from horseback and got paralyzed..any many other examples.

It makes me feel its better to stick to only necessary things. 

Why take these risks (motorcycling, horse riding) at all? I can make go through it for the career

This makes me afraid, what if i take any of these risks and get scared injured or die ...never even beginning to have fulfilled my duties or potential?

Stoic View on Entertainment,"I recently watched All Quiet on the Western Front and enjoyed it.  I didn’t spend time analyzing my judgments about the movie while it’s happening as that would distract me from the plot. I just let my emotions run without questioning them. 

While watching movies I allow myself to get emotionally invested in the characters and the overall narrative for the duration of the film. A large part of the enjoyment I get out of reading fiction is from getting caught up in narrative, and viewing the world through the characters perspectives. These characters are usually flawed in some ways of course and are going to have errors in their reasoning.  Similarly, a large part of watching live sports is rooting for a team. 

Would a stoic forgo these aspects of entertainment for the sake of virtue?  If so, do those of you strictly practicing stoicism miss these pastimes?

A unique and frustrating relationship (need good stoic advice),"Hey everyone. I consider myself an amateur stoic; have read Aurelius and Seneca and am currently reading Epictetus. 

A little background: So I had a 5+ year relationship that ended late 2021. We ended up remaining best friends to this day. Since then, I wanted to get back with her, but have tabled it due to her wanted to work on herself and heal some personal trauma(due to school and family deaths). Throughout the process, I have really tried to be patient, but the past 6 months or so I have been losing my patience with the situation.

The real issue: I am fine with the whole “single” dynamic and letting her heal on her own. However, I do have personal sexual needs that are not being met (I have high sex drive). The last time we had sex was Jan 2022. We live together in seperate rooms but still kiss and maintain a closeness. I have tried to work with her and be patient and understanding but there have been so many times where something can happen and she pulls away. At this point, seeing how much I am hurting, she has told me to look elsewhere to get what I need. The problem with this is that I am devoted to her and am not looking for sex in that kind of way. I am at my breaking point. It not like I am addicted or am falling prey to my desires, as I have done without for past 2 years. But I also want to experience fun and life.

Stoicism for Action,"These are four principles I've written up for myself regarding Stoic action, expressing my view that Stoicism demands service to others in order to live in accordance with nature. 

I've followed each with a personal description and some of my favorite quotes regarding the matter, and included some various links to relevant articles (I <3 Donald Robertson). This is not meant to be a comprehensive defense of that view but sharing my personal reflections on it. 

&#x200B;

1. [The Common Good](https://modernstoicism.com/perspectives-the-stoics-on-the-community-of-humankind/) —> All our aims and actions should be directed towards benefitting the common good, as is in line with natural conduct and the path of virtuous action. We are temperate and courageous so we may [advocate for justice](https://www.orionphilosophy.com/stoic-blog/the-stoic-virtue-of-justice), not for tranquility or our own happiness.
   1. The pursuit of virtue, of justice among people, is that of virtuous action. To act with love, kindness, and compassion towards all others as one humanity; to engage, not withdraw, from public involvement.
   2. *“Born for society, \[the Stoics\] all believed it was their destiny to labor for it; with so much the less fatigue, their rewards were all inside themselves. Happy by their philosophy alone, it seemed as if only the happiness of others could increase theirs.”* (Montesquieu, The Spirit of Laws, 1748)
   3. *“Revere the gods, and look after each other. Life is short — the fruit of this life is a good character and acts for the common good.”* (Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations*, 6.30)
   4. *""The primary mission of the Stoics, in other words, is to be helpful to others and serve the greater good, and they don't do this to make themselves happy. They do it becaues it is the right and natural way to live. But doing it in that spirit, as it turns out, makes them happy.""* (Ward Farnsworth, *The Practicing Stoic*, 208)
   5. *""\[Happiness is found indirectly in the pursuit of other things, which as\] proposed by the Stoic consists primarily of a dedication to reason and a commitment to others -- to service, to justice, to helping in the ways one can.""* (Ward Farnsworth, *The Practicing Stoic*, 209)  

2. [**The Reserve Clause**](https://donaldrobertson.name/2013/02/02/action-with-a-reserve-clause-in-marcus-aurelius/) —> Engaging with the world of indifferents, we must act with detachment: We shall do our utmost to serve the common good, “Fate permitting.”
   1. To succeed or to fail does not make us virtuous. To act energetically in the name of good intentions is all we have the choice of doing. With a reserve clause, a life of pursuing and falling short of justice is still the noblest path.
   2. *“Try persuasion first, but even though men would say to you not to, act when the principles of justice direct you to. If anyone one should obstruct you by force, take refuge in being contented and without emotional pain, and use the obstacle for the display of some other virtue. Remember that the impulse you had was with an “reserve clause”, and your aim was not to do the impossible.”* (*Meditations*, 6.50)
   3. *“Though a man may in some sort hinder my activity, yet on my own voluntary impulses and mental attitude no fetters can be put because of the “reserve clause” and their ability to adapt to circumstances. For everything that stands in the way of its activity is adapted and transmuted by the mind into furtherance of it, and that which is a check on this action is converted into a help to it, and that which is a hindrance in our path goes but to make it easier.”* (*Meditations*, 5.20)  

3. [**Virtue in**](https://donaldrobertson.name/2018/05/15/the-stoic-socrates-four-emotional-resilience-strategies/) **& through Adversity** —> The world provides us with challenges so that we may test ourselves, become more virtuous and capable, and learn to find the value in all that may happen. We have virtues to face challenges; by facing challenges, we become virtuous. 
   1. We are to recognize and love the necessity of obstacles; appreciate our natural ability to confront and overcome it; seek the chance to prove and train ourselves, and find the humor and purpose granted by reversals.
   2. [Life as a “ball game”:](https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/stoicism-as-a-ball-game/) We seek to play with care and respect for other players, acknowledge their efforts to defeat us with calm, and exert ourselves fully with skill *and* neutrality towards the outcome.  A challenge to play well, not flip out. (1)
   3. *“Good men work, spend and are spent, and they do so willingly. Fortune does not drag them; they follow, and keep step.”* (Seneca, On Providence 5.4)
   4. *“This is no misfortune,; to bear it nobly, rather, is good fortune.”* (*Meditations* 4.49)
   5. “*And yet life, Lucilius, is really a battle. For this reason those who are tossed about at sea, who proceed uphill and downhill over toilsome crags and heights, who go on campaigns that bring the greatest danger, are heroes and front-rank fighters; but persons who live in rotten luxury and ease while others toil, are mere turtle-doves safe only because men despise them.”* (Seneca, *Moral Letters to Lucilius*, 96)  

4. [Stoic Joy](https://donaldrobertson.substack.com/p/three-sources-of-happiness-in-stoicism) —> It is in the activities of virtuous pursuit that we find cause to be joyful regarding our own virtue, the virtues of others, and joy in our lot in the world.
   1. We need not suppress our disappointments and frustrations, but rather recognize that they do not undermine the importance of virtuous action. With detachment and present-mindedness, they are easily endurable. 
   2. To the Stoic, virtue alone is sufficient for happiness under any circumstances. It is a rewarding experience to serve others, and enjoy exercising our ability to do so. We may find pleasure in acting out our natural function. 
   3. *“A man when he has done a good act, does not call out for others to come and see, but he goes on to another act, as a vine goes on to produce again the grapes in season.”* (Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations* 5.6)
   4. *""...Happiness is not supposed to be the Stoic goal, not even covertly. The Stoic view, rather, is that one should embrace virtue for its own sake, and that doing so is necessary to get the good side effects of it.""* (Ward Farnsworth, *The Practicing Stoic*, 209)  
 

Thanks for reading! Happy to discuss in the comments as usefully as I am able (fate permitting ;). 

Also, if you have any good articles on how challenges *develop* virtue, please share them and I'll add them to this post -- it seems like a major theme for [Seneca](https://www.stoicinsights.com/senecas-death-and-the-transformation-of-adversity/) and [Epictetus](https://academyofideas.com/2019/02/psychology-of-resilience/) to my mind, but most articles I found focused on philosophical coping mechanisms rather than Stoic virtue creation.

About substances such as caffeine and energy drinks.,"Caffeine is a substance that brings us physical benefits, such as mood and energy, which is especially useful for those who maintain a physical exercise routine.  However, it is addictive and if consumed in excess can cause death.  The same could be said with energy drinks, which have high doses of caffeine.  What kind of attitude would a Stoic take towards this substance?  Consume it, with the aim of reaching your peak in your training, or abstain from this practice?

How do I stop expecting things from people/the world?,"I’m very much new to stoicism, I’ve started reading the important texts but I haven’t gotten very deep yet.

Also I’m aware that some people here are bothered by relationship drama stuff, but here I’m just using it as the most convenient and relevant example.

My partner of 5 years left me for someone else. I haven’t been the perfect partner for her, but I supported her through many trials, made sacrifices for the relationship, etc. Obviously given how she left me for someone else and wasn’t very kind or caring towards me through the break-up process. Regardless of how much I understand how it’s irrational to expect her to treat me more “fairly” and be more grateful for the things I did and sacrificed for her throughout our relationship, deep down I can’t help but do expect it from her and be upset that she did not. Of course this is just one example, as since getting more into stoicism I noticed how much I expect from people and the world and how much energy and words I waste being upset at things/people not turning out how I would want them to. I tell myself and the rational “part” of my brain understands that it’s foolish to wish for a fig in winter. But deeper inside my soul I still cry out for the fig. I’m not sure how stoics are able to rewire themselves to stop wishing for it. Are there exercises for this specifically?

Any help would be appreciated, thank you.",Stoicism,1702718739.0,t3_18jnmtf,0.91,9

Marcus Aurelius teaches to not complain; I kinda disagree.,"The quote goes ""Don't be overhead complaining... not even to yourself"" -Marcus Aurelius, 8.9.  

Complaining is all about emotional expression. when an emotion is dominating your mind it becomes easy to become hopeless, and feel like you cannot fix the problem. When you vent out this emotion (complaining is an easy way to do that), it allows your brain to operate clearly and it removes that burden from your mind. So id wager it's more beneficial to complain in moderation than to not most of the time. Also, from my experience it's a great ice breaker, an easy way to relate to other people, and often doesn't come off as annoying.

How Would a Stoic Deal With a Conservative Religious Family?,"Hi all, I'm a 21 Y.O. living in the UK.  


Roughly 3 years ago, I accepted to myself that I am no longer a Muslim, but rather an agnostic. I kept this hidden from my family, even when they knew that I had a lot of doubts and questions concerning Islam. They demand that I pray all 5 of my daily prayers with them, that I attend religious classes and that I cut ties with any non-religious friends that I may have.  


Fast-forward to today. I have a decent paying job, I have a tenancy agreement for an apartment that I can move into within the next month, and there's a lot of tension that's hard to avoid between my family and I. I believe that moving out will help in raising my self-esteem and my ability to be honest with my parents. They're worried that I'll condemn myself to hell if I don't work on increasing my knowledge when it comes to Islam, and that me considering moving out is a sign that I'm looking to part ways with my family. I've tried to ease their worries by telling them that I'd visit every weekend or so and that my main reason for moving out is to commute into work easier, but all I'm met with are tears, scoldings and guilt-tripping. 

Their actions are understandable. I've told them that I still share their faith, even if I have tons of doubts. They believe that the doubts will only go away once I've submitted myself to god and worked on gaining knowledge in Islam. But the truth is, I have no intention of exploring Islam. I don't want to live the double-life wherein I pretend to be someone I'm not around my family. I understand that telling my family that I'm no longer Muslim could lead to shunning and disownment , but I recognize that this is something I'll have to do. 

I'm feeling a lot of pressure from my siblings, which i find incredibly troubling to deal with. I'm not sure how I can deal with the accusations that I'm causing my parents a lot of suffering, and that It's within my best interests to work on fulfilling their criteria (spending more time with family, going to prayers more often, etc) before moving out. What I haven't told them is that the stress of having to put up a facade around them has lead to me isolating myself from the family. My siblings hold me responsible for my parent's sadness, and that I should forget about the tenancy agreement for the apartment and never bring it up with my parents again.

I'm unsure of what to do next. Part of me believes that I should notify my parents that I've signed the tenancy agreement, move out and then work on telling my family that I'm agnostic. Part of me sees that me bringing it up would only cause pain and more tension, so therefore I shouldn't tell them and I should work on moving out without them noticing.  


What would your stoic tips be for dealing with a situation like this? Would it be acceptable for me to lie about not signing the tenancy agreement to avoid conflict? 

*(TL;DR: Left Islam. Now living a double-life around family. Unsure if I should tell my family that I've decided to move out)*

My logic for ending it,"I have really screwed up life for me and my partner.  I got her pregnant and now just lost my job because of my incompetence and I’ll doubt I’ll get another job in the same field.  I’m also severely depressed.  She is 4 months pregnant.  I think the only way to help her and this child is to take myself out of the picture.  I have some savings and I could leave it all to her and the kid to use.  It could last them a few years.

On Anger,"We all get angry, and stoics would argue that it's how we control that emotion is the important part. But I read this quote and it hit me as a connection I had never made before: ""Anger is an emotional response to an unfulfilled expectation."" I realized how true that was - that when I felt anger it was because something was not happening the way I felt it should.

However this then begged the question: ""So do we then not have any expectations, if we don't want to feel anger?"" Not very realistic, and nihilistic really, which I don't think is any real way to live, but! If you have 0 expectations for anyone or anything then you no longer deal with anger.

So then is it better to temper expectations AND control the emotion of anger?

But if the goal is to \*feel\* less anger; then simply controlling it, isn't really the answer either. I apologize for my rambling - I'm just trying to write down what has been rolling around in my head for the last little bit.

Having trouble reading Epictetus,"Hi,

I've read The Meditations (and loved it) so I wanted to see what Epictetus had to say as well. I got to about chapter 18 (or I18?) in book 1 and honestly I'm just confused at this point. 

I understand the Discourses are, well, discourses and not really a book written by Epictetus himself, but still I find his arguments being rather confusing and messy. Not very clear. 

For example: Chapter, 17, is titled ""concerning the necessity of logic"" (I got the penguin classics edition). Epictetus starts by presenting a problem/paradox - reason can only be analyzed either by itself or by something superior, however ""there is nothing superior to reason"" and reason cannot analyze itself because it creates an endless loop. Then he goes on to address a claim (hypothetical or from someone in the audience? i'm not sure) saying that regardless, emotions are more important than logic, only to show that it isn't the case and that no debate could be held with rules set by emotions.

So, he says, we use logic to define the terms in which we analyze things and discuss among ourselves (but how is that related to the paradox at the begging?). Then he goes on to argue against another claim against logic and then he ends up with talking about understanding nature, some victim of something unclear and then God and a philosopher's power of interpretation.

Of course it's much more complicated but I tried to keep it short XD

So as you can see, this is what I got from this chapter. Honestly I don't understand what he was trying to say and it's the same in most of the other chapters. He seems a bit all-over-the-place for me.

I wanted to know if other readers faced the same problem or is it just me? Is he getting clearer in following chapters? Maybe you could give me tips on how to read Epictetus, maybe I'm missing something?

Stoicism as an ever evolving philosophy,"In my mind, stoicism must evolve and change with the times to remain relevant. Marcus Aurelius, one of the most quoted and beloved stoic thinkers would most likely not fit the mold of how we think of stoics today. Despite being a man that pursued virtue as the highest importance he owned slaves. Would owning a slave today fit our judgment of what it means to be Just, one of the touchstones of stoic philosophy? I certainly hope not! People are a product of their time and their experiences.

Stoic advice for the probable loss of a pet?,"I've been reading about stoicism for about a year now and its had a huge impact on my mental health, however recently my ability to put it to use has been tested to say the least. 

This may seem trivial compared to other peoples problems, but I have a young cat (soon to be five y/o) who I may lose in the near future. He has a condition he has to be medicated for and this medication has a long list of probable side effects, the biggest one being another illness where I have decided that I would rather put him down than make him go through that treatment.

This is not a 100% certanity, but it is indeed a very probable risk and I cannot stop worrying, waiting and bracing myself for the heartache of having to decide to let him go. I have had more time than many others have gotten and I try to be thankful for this and to appreciate each day instead of thinking about the next, but this is constantly on my mind and I feel so sad and anxious about it.

How stoics deals with racism?,"I come from oppressed community in India, we are untouchables or Dalits, we're still treated like trash in my country. I want to do good things for the people not just for mine but for everyone. But the criticism and everything stops me and makes me anxious.

Although I haven't experienced discrimination directly. But I read it online about growing violence against our community. I have experienced it indirectly a lot. I tried to be best for my whole life and I succeeded in that too, I topped my school and college. People say that I am mediocre Dalit and that whatever I get is because of reservations (which is a special law for giving equal opportunity for oppressed communities, by allowing equal representation of people in education and other areas, like affirmative action). Think of Jews living in ghettos during ww2 Germany (I don't mean to offend anyone nor I am associating with worst tragedy in history, it's just the growing violence scares me and I can resonate with that event). Because of this and reading about violence, I hardly talk to anyone because I am scared to be out in public. I stopped going out for dates and asking out many years ago, cuz I am afraid that it will end badly and no one wants to get married and associated with a ""Dalit"". I am too scared of achieving my goals because everything in India is based on casteism, I may not find a house on rent because my caste. It's just bad here.

I used to lie in school about my caste.

Even though it happened it hasn't turned me into a bitter person. I respect every individual and empathize with others. I control my anger nor do I argue with someone who calls me names or makes fun of my community and call us scums. It's just that I am scared to do anything. Because if I achieve something in life I will be known as ""Dalit boy who... achieved something"" not a ""College boy who... achieved something"" or ""Engineering student who... achieved something""

If I have to do something I have to stay in limits because that may exploit my caste and people will bash my family for this reason.

Seeing things just as they are,"Hello everybody. 
Lately I've been advancing in my studies of Stoicism and I've come to a realization, more of the development of a skill actually. Lately I have been able to see things the way they are. What do I mean by this?

Someone says an insult. Is it good? Bad? It was just an insult, or more radically, just words that were cataloged negatively by us.

Someone outplayed you? They just did a certain action. Now it is up to you to cataloge it in a way.
 
Do you feel frustration? It was just a feeling that makes you stay alert and feel weird things, not necessarily bad. 

After meditating on this new skill that I have been developing, I was very confused how should I use it in a way that is constructive, for the Virtue, for the community and for my path. Now I realize that insults are starting to lose meaning for me, therefore they start to mean less and less, it's just words, and now I feel some kind of power, like ""I can do whatever I want with that insult"". Destructive behaviors, the same. I have been gradually overcoming that confusion through Stoic ethics, at least the few I've studied about it. I decide to use this for what I judge to be good, the justice, for the community, for my learning and development path. It is interesting. Have any of you experienced this before?

Antipater,"I see a lot of people seeking advice so I thought I would switch things up with some food for thought. Stoicism seems to be perceived as an all or nothing philosophy that encourages us to not feel and discourages us when we fall short. This doesn’t have to be the case. Antipater, the 6th leader of the stoic school formed by Zeno, took the philosophy in another direction than his predecessors by loosening some of the absolutist rules that had been laid before him. Early stoics held that all sins were wrong and equal. Antipater rejected this notion recognizing that stealing a loaf of bread is not the same as murdering the baker for the bread. In Lives of the Stoics, by Stephen Hanselman and Ryan Holiday, they compare the modern stoic to an archer. “We train and practice. We draw back the arrow and aim it to the best of our abilities. But we know full well that despite our training and our aim, many factors outside our control will influence where the arrow hits the target-or if it falls short entirely. We take action. But much happens after that-much of it is not remotely up to us. Which is why we know that our true worth does not reside in whether or not we get a bullseye.”  I thought that was a fitting analogy. Something to think on, something I wanted to share.",Stoicism,1702600428.0,t3_18inafj,0.63,5

Should I be always trying to think if I did the most virtue thing that I could?,"I was thinking about that: Should I be, after all actions, thinking about them and questioning myself if it was the best action i could take or should I simply focus on trying to take the best action and later on on the day, maybe evening, I stop and think about that while journaling or meditating, and focusing the judgment of my action on this period of the day? That came to my mind because a lot of times I end up being caught on my own thoughts in the mid of the day trying to judge some action of mine and this leads to more untoughtful actions.

Being ok with saying goodbye,"My parents are seperated but they’re both alcoholics. My dad is worse, he lost his great career like 8 years ago, lost a few jobs after that, been to detox over 5 times in the past 5 years but he keeps going back to drinking. 

I moved from one place back to my hometown to help him and hopefully get him clean, at this point I’m over it. He’s getting kicked out of his place soon and I’m heading back across the country to finally focus on my own life. I always felt like I have to go out of my way to parent my parents but I’ve delayed my own career and life for them. 

When I move I don’t plan to come back, unless to visit. Leaving means, like everyday, he (or anybody in the world) may pass. I feel like I’ve tried what I can do but he needs to fix himself as we all do. My parents were great when I was growing up then fell down these dark holes when I entered adulthood. If they were terrible parents I could leave easier and never look back.

"If emotions seem to be a natural result of the body, why are we trying to control them so much?","There's a concept in stoicism that we should control that which we can, and accept those things which we cannot.  But can we really control the fact we feel emotions?  I've never met anyone who doesn't experience them, and personally they feel very instant and inevitable.  It seems like to me, I have an inevitable emotion, and then a controllable, separate, external reaction to it.

To me, once I'm already feeling an emotion, it makes it much worse to try and suppress it.  So I kind of just give myself permission to feel whatever naturally comes.  Letting myself be okay with not being okay is deeply liberating and has really been centering to me emotionally, but it seems this isn't the majority consensus on the stoic treatment of emotions, and me admitting to others I'm feeling certain emotions isn't stoic at all.  But when I do this, I feel much more calm and controlled, and the emotions I do have are smaller on the outside.

So I wanted to ask if there's an appropriately stoic way to see this.  I've been reading Epictetus and so far nothing in the enchiridion goes against what I'm saying.  But it seems this is not the common interpretation of the content, and that most have a concept of a stoic being a sort of iceman/woman

My mind goes nuts over a choice that I didn't have,"I want to embrace stoicism, but my mind keeps pointing me back to my ""old"" ways. 

This is the weirdest most recent example: 
I recently started a new job. Part of that was getting a company car. Normally you'd order one from the 3 choices the company has for you, these are mainly the cheapest versions of cars. With the push to ev's however this means I can only choose electric cars. We already have one ev at home and like an ice car as backup, so my only option is getting one from the company pool. 

I had two choices: a few months old ford focus or a 3 years old Opel Astra. I obviously went for the Ford, added bonus is that when i do have to pick an EV i can pick a more matured one. 

Now I have a colleague who was fortunate and could choose one of the last Ice cars. He went for the new Opel Astra. Turns out that basic Astra is way more luxurious than my Ford albeit a bit more expensive. 

My mind now constantly goes into ""what if"" mode. Because of course, my mind believes the new Opel is the better choice. I believe this goes back to my constant persuit of perfection. If i have choices, no matter what they are about, u always try to go for the best and very best one. 

Tl;dr:
My mind is contemplating over a choice I didn't even have. Stoicism tells me that all I have control over is my own judgement, yet my mind can't stop overthinking this. What to do? 

And yes, I know this is a first world problem. I'm happy with the car and very fortunate, but I also want to make clear that I do pay for it.",Stoicism,1702547760.0,t3_18i59ss,0.7,5
"""There is nothing fearful in nature for the rational man""","I've come across this quote in a lecture about Marcus Aurelius ( Michael Sugrue). Quotes like this and others

""He who fears death will never do anything worth of a man who is alive"" - Seneca.

underscore  the paralyzing effect of fear. I often find myself hesitating to do stuff held back by the uncertainty and anxiety surrounding the unknown, so by fear. Most of these fears are irrational. Quotes like this remind that life is meant to be lived and always avoiding things u fear kills u in a metaphorical sense. And if worse comes to worst injury, death or other losses are all just part of nature and therefore not anything to be afraid of.

A stoic perspective on the irreplaceable,"My Dad passed away suddenly this year. First and foremost he was an amazing father with a deep sense of duty and community. He was a well respected Jungian psychologist both in his practice and as a professor. He was a role model in the relationship he shared with my mom and a man that practiced what he preached. He has been the most influential person in my life.

I’m posting this in hope that someone else may find value in my reflections on how stoicism influenced my thoughts around his passing. 

————

When we accept that we have been deprived of something we once had, our next logical instinct is to choose one of the following courses of action: find it, replace it, or do without it.

When something irreplaceable is taken, we cannot find it again because it exists nowhere else. We cannot replace it, as that is the definition of irreplaceable. Then, we are seemingly left with only one option: to do without. What may seem as the lesser of three outcomes is the most beautiful. 

When we accept the nature of what was given back as irreplaceable we can only choose to do without. Once that choice is made we can be at peace with what was given back. We no longer struggle to find what we had again or recreate it. Accepting that we will never have what we had ever again is not a lamentation, it is a testament to how beautiful and special it was. 

We must see ourselves as artists and what is gone as our work of art. We may enjoy creating the work, admire its shape as it takes form, and even the struggle to make it beautiful. The complete and refined beauty of our work can only be seen after we are finished with it. Our appreciation for what we created is deepened when we know every step that formed it.

We shouldn’t look back at what we had and wish we still had it. We now have the privilege to look back on it as completed. We get to admire how beautiful our journey with it was from start to finish. Our focus is on how grateful we are that fate allowed us to have something so precious at all, regardless of duration. 

It’s the rarest joy to give back something that cannot be replaced.

"A short review, and a question, regarding unearned wisdom in the modern era. Would love to hear your thoughts.","UNEARNED WISDOM IN THE MODERN ERA

Growing up and living in the modern era provides a unique experience, compared to our ancestors’, in respect to the accessibility of information. In a world where we are more interconnected than ever before, we are blessed to have instant and untethered access to knowledge and information in mere seconds, through use of the internet.

Lessons that once took a near lifetime to learn can be easily accessed by keyboard. Endless archives of wisdom, built upon through the ages, as a result of hard work and discipline, hand us the opportunity to learn and grow on a silver platter.

Herein the problem lies, many of us are constantly looking outwards for answers, or worse yet, outsourcing a sense of purpose and growth, subcontracting the hard work and toil required to gain such wisdom, and condensing said effort into mere seconds, leaving us overstimulated, desensitised, and none-the-wiser.

Knowledge, without practical application, is almost useless. That is, unless your goal is to *sound* like someone who has their life together. But actions speak louder than words, and eventually these pseudo-sages will demonstrate their lack of self control.

So, then the question remains, how do you pick the low-hanging fruit of the modern day world, and turn it into actual, practical wisdom?

Wisdom can be defined as *‘the quality of having experience, knowledge and good judgement’.*

In order to reach good judgement, we must first possess the knowledge, which can be unlocked through the experience.

Here is a step-by-step process for effectively gaining accurate wisdom through experience:

**Step One**

A certain event will happen, which has a significant outcome, either expected or not. The more intensely positive, or negative, the experience is, the more valuable information there may be to learn, and the higher levels of emotion that may be produced as a by-product.

**Step Two**

Reflection on the experience, if possible including the ability to compare it to others, the vision to explore other possible outcomes, creating knowledge. Reflection must come from an emotionally stable perspective, otherwise it can distort the lesson which remains to be learned.

For example, a start-up business which fails, losing a lot of money, will be a highly emotional event, but inside will be a treasure trove of knowledge and experience, which could undoubtedly help in the future.

Concerning pearls of wisdom, it should be known, that in order to claim the precious gemstone from the tightly clasped oyster, your fingers will get sore and bloodied in the process.

If the event is reviewed from an emotionally driven perspective, the person involved may say: “I knew my colleagues were right, I am not cut out to be a businessman, I should have just stayed in my previous job.”

But this does not give much, if any, useful feedback. It just provides an emotional reasoning as to why the event unfolded this way, rather than a logical situational report which can better guide us in the future.

And this kind of emotional response is not only negatively-based, for example if the same new business was instantly a huge success, perhaps the emotionally driven reflection would be: “I am so great at opening businesses. I must have the golden touch!” – creating a false sense of genius in oneself, leading to overreaching and under-preparing later on.

In order to be successful and accurate in your reflection of events, you must be emotionally removed. This can take time, to detach yourself from the immediacy of the situation, but necessary in order to have an impartial perspective.

**Step Three**

The ability to judge new situations, and modify choices or behaviour based on the knowledge gained from previous experience, thus defining wisdom.

In order to be able to draw on such knowledge, like in the previous step, you must begin with an emotionally stable frame-of-mind. With a higher risk or reward relying on the outcome of the event in question, the situation will become more emotionally charged, making emotional detachment more difficult, creating a reaction, rather than an action.

With this step-by-step of earning wisdom through experience, the question stands. Not all those who are experienced are wise, but is it possible to become wise without experience? How do you absorb the wisdom of lessons which you haven’t lived yourself?",Stoicism,1702468375.0,t3_18hf56u,0.57,1

Breakup Guilt,"Hello,

Six months ago my boyfriend left me. I was very emotional in the relationship, driven by my insecurities. This led him to cheat and then abandon me and cut contact completely. These last months, all I’ve been doing is playing a loop in my head hoping I would’ve done things differently and he’d still be here. I feel like I was abusive and it is haunting me. I learned so much and I’ll never be like that again, but I learned it after losing him. I’m filled with regret and constantly telling myself it was all my fault.

Can anyone offer me some advice?

Thank you.",Stoicism,1702448585.0,t3_18hagsf,0.45,0
I’ve hurt my friend.,"So, basically, I was asking a classmate for advice and stated, ""Though I don't think you can help because you're always complaining about X..., I wanna hear what you got.""
Stupid me. I realized how unconscious I was the instant I said my statement. 

After class, I apologized to him, and he instantly began expressing his emotions. I could see he had delayed his reaction since the teacher had entered the classroom.

It was arrogant of me. I love my friend, we both are the closest to one another and remembering what happened makes me sad.

Ancient stoics and suicide,"So I read letter 12 from seneca and it felt like he was talking about suicide and I researched about it seems multiple stoics from Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius and seneca , cato all talks about suicide 

So what actually stopped them from carrying it out? 

Considering marcus had a huge nation to rule? 
Epictetus was a slave with severe punishment? 
Seneca being a general when nero was young it was said seneca was handling political affairs? 

So all these are too huge of a roles and must have lot of obstacles

What stopped them from suicide?(not saying later event with seneca) 

And why shouldn't one consider it? ""As stoics are not bounded or afraid by obstacles yet if there is no way suicide is a way"" So why to endure hardship of life then?

"Social media toxicity, R/vegan, and what should I do.","So I am recently new to Reddit, again. I was on reddit back in  2012 to 2014, but stopped until this year. I like how Reddit is mostly more positive, especially compared to the toxicity of Facebook. 
I have found great communities from books, dogs, satellite radio fans, to philosophy.
But something recently left a bad taste in my mouth. I am vegetarian and try mostly for a vegan diet due to my morality with animals. Not preaching this is just my personal beliefs, but I feel this is important information for the story.
So anyways I also joined R/vegan.
I posted a few times on the subreddit and recently I posted an article entitled ""Veganism is in crisis, and the fanatics can only blame themselves"" and asked what the people what they thought of the criticism. Just because I was curious. I did not write the article.
But I would say about 40% to 45% started to attack me personally or my online persona I guess.
I like to think I have tuff skin and shit posters and trolls don't bother me, but this time it kind of did.
I was just asking what people thoughts were and to start a discussion. I didn't give my opinion of the article and I have been posting on the board for awhile. 
But almost half of them seemed mad at me, I tried to defend myself, but they didn't seem to care. After a few responses I realized I was just wasting my time and deleted my post and blocked a few people. 
I had my wife look at the post and she says it did not look offensive or anything like that, but I do admit she could be biased.
I was really starting to like Reddit with the discussions. But R/vegan makes me question if I should give up social media in general. I don't know. 
I like the discussions, but I am getting to old to deal with shit posters all the time. I am not sure if this was a one time fluke, a vegan thing (I am not unrealistic, I know how they can be sometimes), a reddit thing, or just people...

How much mental energy or thought process does practicing Stoicism take up?,"BTW: I wasn't sure if I should be putting this in the ""New to Stoicism"" or in ""Seeking Stoic Advice"" - I've only been interested in Stoicism as a means for dealing with my own circumstances for the past year or so.

For some context: I struggle with the actual practicing of Stoicism, mostly due to having ADHD (mostly the Inattentive type).  Despite trying to work on it, I can often find the impulsive nature of my mind engages way too quickly.  If I'm in a 'hyperfocused' state regarding Stoicism, I can manage that a little better - but the effort it seems to take mentally is exhausting.

So:

I don't think I've seen this discussed - but how much time and effort is spent mentally going over the practice of being Stoic?  I am aware in CBT there are often things like half-hour daily exercises, but these are really more transformative things that are designed to work over longer periods.  To me, Stoicism is more a 'way of life' kind of philosophy and thinking - reacting to and interpreting situations and circumstances constantly.

That constant examination and practice seems exhausting to me.  I'm the kind of person who can become mentally exhausted after doing a client meeting, or having a slightly busier day, or just one of those days where my brain decides to inner monologue about anything and everything constantly.  Add to that all the little rules I have to follow otherwise I'll lose things, forget things and generally mess my day up horribly.  I often have to force myself to mono-task and try to keep focus even doing a simple thing like making a cup of tea or a sandwich.

This is all compounded by my seeing this quote of Epictetus: ""Don't explain your philosophy.  Embody it."" when I've been searching for some kind of guidance.  To me, to embody something is to take it on completely, utterly - it becomes ***everything***.

I guess alternatively - what is a good balance of applying Stoic principles in your mind over just letting things flow naturally to see how well the practices are taking hold? 

(In my life, and mind, if I'm not actively thinking about a process, then that process can very much not exist at all.  So coming into a situation where I *could* practice a Stoic principle, I'll forget that I can and instead do something else, and on reflection, something worse.)

I hope this makes sense, it's really hard for me to put down into words exactly what I'm trying to get across (and I'm sure I've probably missed some obvious point I should have made lol).",Stoicism,1702425079.0,t3_18h1dcc,0.7,6

How do you practice not trying to get stressed out about things out of your control? Is that missing the point?,"I have a bumpy relationship with my mother. She frequently burns bridges with people and is generally negative and depressing to be around. She burned a bridge with my fiance last year, and generally has a bad relationship with my sister. This xmas we will all be spending it in separate locations (which is fine with me given the situation) but my mom is being super negative about it because she believes the 24th is ""her"" time to have us at her house. Long story short, shes tough to be around and pushes people away but still wants us to spend time with her.

I called her today to invite her to our house for xmas, since my sister would be away and I know my mom has no one else to spend xmas with (other than her husband and his family). She says she will be spending xmas with them and goes on a low key rant about how we won't be with her and how we don't want to go over to her house anymore, etc. I even tell her that we will plan to all be at her house next year, and she replies with ""yeah if im even alive next year"". Like, that is some straight up emotional abuse right there lol.

I dreaded calling her. I had anxiety thinking about the conversation. This is not right. I am not making any rash decisions because of this, in part thanks to stoicism. I understand this is out of my control and that I cannot change how she feels/acts/talks. The thing I don't like is still being stressed out about it. The dread. The anxiety.

The concept of virtue is circular,"Stoics advocate for following virtue, but what how might one define what is virtuous? A stoic would respond: ""that which results in your contentment/ what is in your nature.""   


The skeptic would rightly reply, ""what makes you content?""   


The Stoic would reply: ""That which uses the right reason""  


And on and on the circular reasoning goes. Without defining what contentment is or what the right reason is, this is a never ending circle and doesn't mean anything.   


Another counterargument: that which is just, wise, moderate and courageous is what makes you content.   


The skeptic would reply ""Why are those things virtues and not something else?"" And there is no answer.   


Finally, a Stoic might say something like: ""That which is good for you is the right use of reason""  


The skeptic would reply: ""But you just said that the only thing good for me is the right use of reason. If the only thing that is good is reason, then why is what is good for you the right use of reason? In other words, doing what is good is the right use of judgement, but you haven't actually defined what is good. Without defining what is good, then what makes it a good judgement?""

I’m struggling to understand the stoic texts,"Per this sub I started reading the Dialogues of Epictetus. I just finished chapter one of book one and am very confused.

What are all the faculties? He then gives the example of grammatic art and music as faculties that can’t contemplate themselves. And the “rational faculty” as the only one that can.

I am reading through Meditations for the first time and early on he mentions that one thing he learned from his adopted father was not to be too self indulgent and he admired that he had, “no concern for food, or the cut and color of his clothes, or having attractive slaves.”

My understanding is that stoicism teaches us how to better handle adversity and how to carry yourself in a way that others can respect. I don’t understand why caring about how you present yourself would negatively impact the Stoic.

Stoicism for giving birth,"
I'm going to be giving birth in a few weeks. What advice does Stoic philosophy have for me? Has anyone on here faced this experience and found Stoic perspectives helpful?

I plan to use pain medication in combination with other coping techniques - I find it most helpful personally to think of childbirth as lying along the spectrum of human experience that we can bring the resources of humanity (modern medicine!) to bear against, rather than a primal/natural event that my body will handle in a way separate from other parts of my life. (Dying is also part of the human experience, and people with a choice in the matter rarely form a goal of ""getting through it without unnatural interventions."") But I also understand that people feel many ways about this topic, and have a great admiration for people who pursue an unmedicated delivery - please don't make this post into a war about which of these approaches is ""more Stoic.""

Even though I expect to get an epidural, the education and medical advice I've gotten are consistent in recommending to delay epidurals until fairly late in the game (or at least it seems late to me) to avoid slowing labor. Epidurals can also fail or turn out to be unavailable for a variety of reasons. So I know I'm in for ??? hours of steadily increasing discomfort and pain, in an altered mental and hormonal state I haven't experienced before.  I also have never had my pain tolerance tested to an extreme degree, and know that pain tolerance and the experience of what labor feels like varies hugely. 

I vacilate between using voluntary discomfort as opportunities to practice not-suffering, and trying not to borrow worry/suffering from the future by going too nuts with it. I hold a lot of ice cubes and long yoga poses, and have access to good resources for specific mental management techniques for handling contractions.

Stoic perspectives have been very helpful to me during pregnancy, both for pregnancy symptoms (treatable and untreatable) and for thinking about upcoming labor.  There is a lot I can't control both about things that are inevitable (pain) and things that are unknowable (what complications arise, if I have back labor or require other medical interventions, if my epidural fails) - and it's very freeing to realize this means that me ruminating about it won't change anything. 

I don't have a significant formal background in stoic philosophy, so I'd be grateful for both your own impressions as well as specific topics, concept names, or readings that might be relevant. I am interested in any male or female perspectives on this question, so long as they don't amount to ""women just have some kind of special sauce for going through childbirth and they forget it afterward!""

Does stoic philosophy provide a justification for the holocaust?,"Good day all, I have this question that I have not been able to google and am keen to hear your opinions. That is, how would a stoic look at the holocaust? Epictetus says ""Things that are not within our own power, not without our Will, can by no means be either good or evil"". So if you were someone within the concentration camp, would you say that the holocaust was neither good nor evil and embrace it? 

He also says ""until you know their reasons, how do you know they’ve acted wrongly"". And the same applies here, if you do not know why a nazi did what he did, how do we say it was wrong? Just because he had orders to kill someone, does not mean there were not anterior motives, motives we are not aware of. 

Please let me know what you think. This community is well more versed in stoic philosophy than I.

Is this stoicism or something else? Vanity?,"Life is suffering. To engage in life's pleasures is to cause more greater suffering later in life. To the contrary, to allow yourself to suffer and deal with the suffering of life in the present, softens the suffering later in life.

Example. People go on vacation and blow thousands of dollars instead of working or investing that money. They buy temporary happiness, but end up slaving for money for more of their life. To the contrary, someone who does not partake in these types of temporary happiness, save money and invest and can become financially free and reduce their suffering later in life by embracing the hard work and discipline it takes to focus on what is important; in this case that is financial freedom.

Does anyone else struggle with feelings of sanctimony and an inflated ego with stoicism?,"Stoicism has helped my life massively, and because  of that I feel like it’s starting to inflate my ego. Anytime I find myself stroking my own ego, I try to bring myself back to reality.

I find arrogant/know it all people to be so incredibly cringe and obtuse, but I can’t help but start to feel that way about myself. Stoicism has changed my life in such a dramatic way, that I can’t help but feel like I know a secret to life that everyone else is ignorant to…and my ego insists on telling me I must be such a special snowflake for possessing the knowledge few others have. I find myself impulsively preaching to others about stoicism and I feel gross after the fact(I will gladly talk about it to those who like to talk philosophy, but others don’t care).


The rational part of me knows I’m not special, or better than anyone else…and I’d really like to develop a sense of natural humility to bring myself back to ground level. At times when I am humble, my ego busts in the door of my mind like the Koolaid man saying ""Wow look you are so admirable and special for being humble!!!"".

Was wondering if anyone else has struggled with their own inflated egos since living the stoic life.",Stoicism,1702310400.0,t3_18fxsv4,0.44,0
Small Stoic Win Today,"At a roundabout today, I wanted to exit and a guy comes in a pick up and is hovering dangerously close. I was about to enter (had my indicator on for a while), but he kept nudging closer and eventually it was so dangerous that I aborted and kept on the outside lane, letting him pass. I then exited safely.

Yes, I wanted to honk the horn and tell him a few insults, but I felt that I wouldn't gain anything apart from satisfying my ego. Also I would waste time.

So I just accepted what happened and went on my way.. only to get stuck behind the same guy who was stuck behind a learner driver driving very slowly :D

Stoicism - Reading the news or not?,"I've been involved with stoicism for about a year now. Reading books, listening to podcasts, watching videos etc. I feel like I have successfully applied rules and values to my life. I am definitely less angry, my short temper is gone, I'm able to smile more, I accept things for who or what they are, I generally feel better etc.

Recently, I had had a discussion with a friend of mine. He isn't as involved in stoicism, but he knows what it is and it's core values.

He asked me about an event that happened in the world, and I told him I wasn't aware of it, because I don't read the news. He asked why, and I told him that the news make me angry, thus I avoid it. Although, I still read news I find interesting that doesn't upset me, like technology and some entertainment news.

He told me that he can read the news and not get angry, and stay neutral regardless of what he's reading. That's definitely not me. The news themselves, and how the media stirs the pot and presents the news, it's a breeding ground for anger. So I avoid it, and in return I'm happier, with the blowback of not staying as informed about the world (which can be a blessing and a curse).

My friend told me that a TRUE stoic, would be able to read any news and stay neutral, and me avoiding the news isn't what a stoic person should do. A stoic person should block out external things while staying informed. He argued that I should train myself to read the news, whatever it is, and stay neutral.

This intrigued me. It felt like a superpower. But me training myself by reading negative news, and forcing myself to stay neutral, sounds awful. I mean, how long would that take?

But first let's get the definition down here. Local news headline: 8-year-old girl sexually assaulted by 3 men. Alright… Do I smash things around me? No. But I carry this news with me in the back of my head, and it's there, making me angrier than I should have been if I didn't read it. It can affect my entire day.

I don't see how a person could read that and stay neutral? In fact, that out right sounds like a psychopath.

What do you think?

EDIT: So many incredible comments. I wasn't expecting to get so dwelled down into stoic theory. This was great. 

Based on a lot of your comments as well as stoic theory, I'm guessing my friend is correct. However, flooding myself with negatiity just to stay informed about world events; isn't something I see as something good. 

Also important to mention is the fact that one news article doesn't upset me, or make me angry, despite the original post making it look like that. I'm talking about watching and reading general media news on a daily basis, and over months or years building a negative mindset. I can read a bad piece of news and brush it off. Should have made that more clear from the start.

I've been heavily informed, and I have been heavily uninformed (current state), and based on my mood and life in general, I prefer to be uninformed. Not MISINFORMED, but UNINFORMED. Reading up in current local news is a good thing. Reading up what happens on the other side of the world does no longer interest me. 

Thank you all for the great discussion!",Stoicism,1702298437.0,t3_18ftnmv,0.8,14
What would the stoics have thought about eating animals in modern day?,"After reading meditations, it's clear that Marcus Aurelius was focused on living within his own nature as a human being, and valued the humans ability to reason above everything.

On one hand, eating meat is human nature, we are clearly omnivores and have eaten meat as a species for as long as we've been around. 
However in modern day, eating meat isn't a requirement to live a healthy life, and the mass production of meat is widely thought to be inefficient and cruel, so using reason and the information we have available, eating meat wouldn't be the virtuous choice.

I've just been thinking about this lately, and thought there was a bit of a clash between our nature and our ability to reason in this area. There's probably more stuff like this as the modern world is so different to what was going on back when Marcus was knocking about.",Stoicism,1702292647.0,t3_18fs32u,0.55,9
Stoicism doesn’t account for the unvirtuous motivations of beneficial behavior,"Many criticisms of stoicism are based upon faulty logic or misunderstandings, but one criticism that has always stuck with me is stoicism seems to underestimate is the heavy influence of unvirtuous motivations to drive positive behaviour.

Stoicism emphasizes the importance of a proper perspective, and valuing virtue above all else. Typically it is seen as unvirtuous to allow your emotions to control you, to allow yourself to stress unnecessarily, or to pursue things like sex, status or ego. 

However, modern psychology indicates these are humanities strongest motivators.  Thus, the closer to a sage you become, the more you eliminate these motivators, and the less productive of a citizen you will become, which ends up defeating a large part of being stoic in the first place. 

You can argue: “To stoics the only thing that matters is you are virtuous.” Would it be virtuous to decline a method which allow you can help fellow man more? Is it not selfish to reject the ability to care more because it harms you more?",Stoicism,1702278563.0,t3_18fos0s,0.36,0
Question about one’s own nature,"Hello,

I was contemplating about the fact that people can have their own ""natures"". For instance, I find that my nature is to provide for a family by having a job and loving/providing for them. Because of that, I studied and got a job to make that happen. 

I find my nature to be virtuous because I’m also serving society and whatnot, but then I thought I probably am biased in my line of thinking. 

I thought of a scenario where a person thinks that not working and not serving society is what nature demands of them due to any hypothetical reason (maybe they think society has failed them and that the right thing to do is to act against it). In that case, doing the opposite of what I thought was virtuous would become the virtuous thing to do for this person.

Is my thought on the right track? Or are there established guidelines for one’s nature to be virtuous? I thought of this after reminding myself of how Diogenes was praised by some stoic philosophers in some aspects (like in the famous banquet analogy).",Stoicism,1702266825.0,t3_18flmnz,0.99,7
What are some modern stoic texts you can recommend?,"When I was in 7th grade I read “The seven habits of highly effective people.” I didn’t know it at the time, but that was my first exposure to many of the stoic principles. A couple years later I read “Man’s search for meaning” and that book deeply moved me and taught me so much about the core of stoicism. In 11th grade I read “The Tao of Pooh” and used that book as a my personal spiritual guidebook until I discovered stoicism. When I was introduced to stoicism by the book “a guide to the good life” I felt like I had found a way of living that brought together the fundamental principles that had inspired and spoken to me throughout my life. I still consider myself very new to stoicism as it has only been a year and half since I started seriously studying it. Even so, one of my favorite things to do is to look for parallels in the works of the ancient stoics and that of other books I read, especially fiction. 

What are some modern (as in post enlightenment) texts that you find to be deeply stoic texts? Not stoic commentaries, but actual stand alone projects that teach or demonstrate the principles found within stoicism?",Stoicism,1702252449.0,t3_18fh1r1,0.92,32

"Self sufficiency over virtue, initially","I've been revisiting a piece in the Discourses http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0236%3Atext%3Ddisc%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D9,  and I know that ""self sufficiency is the greatest of all wealth"" is Epicurean(I think), and wealth is an indifferent in Stoicism?, but..

""..But a man may say, Whence shall I get bread to eat when I have nothing?""...""Wretch, if you have it, you will have it; if you have it not, you will depart from life...""

Somewhere in that section Epictetus calls some animals irrational and cowardly and then regards them at the same time for being self sufficient and living according to nature. I've heard that the success rate of a hunt for lions in our African wilderness is about 25% and many of them die from starvation. But when they succeed, they roar without reply and ravage without resistance.  I've also heard that tigers are pretty unremorseful. 

""...But we think about ourselves, as if we were only stomachs, and intestines, and shameful parts; we fear, we desire; we flatter those who are able to help us in these matters, and we fear them also...""

""..And shall it be necessary for one among us who is a philosopher to travel into foreign parts, and trust to and rely on others, and not to take care of himself, and shall he be inferior to irrational animals...""

It's coming off alittle like ""do it yourself, do what you have to do to survive..or atleast do what your nature requires in that given context because even actions which appear to be—and indeed are—immoral or unjust advance the overall design, which taken as a whole is harmonious and
good. Because they, too, are governed by the logos.""",Stoicism,1702240268.0,t3_18fcm4o,0.86,5

One major change and some minor changes to the subreddit,"Howdy, we have decided on the small handful of changes described below.

\- **The New Agora**  
In order to better ensure that users seeking Stoic advice receive well-informed, specifically Stoic responses, we have decided to make a major change in the subreddit. Posts with the ""Seeking Stoic Advice"" flair will now be considered as seeking specifically and recognizably Stoic advice. Users who are seeking and offering personal opinions inspired by Stoicism, sharing experiences that may be influenced by Stoicism, or requesting and attempting to administer ""[first aid](https://modernstoicism.com/two-types-of-stoic-therapy-by-john-sellars/)"" will be welcome to do so in the New Agora, a daily pinned thread for these and other types of exchanges (including, for example, casual questions users don't want create posts for and extremely limited self-promotion). The New Agora is not an anything-goes thread; instead, it is for things that may be more tangentially, rather than directly, Stoic. Activity that is way off-base remains unwelcome.  
If your ""Seeking Stoic Advice"" post is removed because you are seeking personal opinions or asking what-would-you-do questions, you may instead post in the New Agora. 

\- **User flairs**  
In the interest of improving communication, we have decided to implement user flairs. In order to receive a user flair, message the moderators with your request. Pending our consensus, informed by our review of your activity, our background knowledge, and/or other factors, we will assign the flair and it will appear beside your username when you are active here. You may apply for flairs in accordance with the most suitable descriptors of your experience or interest. For example, flairs may include ""qualified/trustworthy user,"" ""academic/scholar,"" or ""προκόπτων."" The moderators may also decide to grant flairs to users on their own, without applications in mod messages, pending the user's agreement.

\- **Post flairs**  
As mentioned, the ""Seeking Stoic Advice"" flair is now strictly for seeking well-informed advice strictly drawing from and clearly aligned with Stoic philosophy.The ""Stoic Theory/Study"" flair will now only be assigned by moderators. If you would like to use this flair on your post, use the ""Pending Theory/Study"" flair. This will flag our attention, and we will review your post to determine whether to assign the ""Stoic Theory/Study"" flair. This is intended to prevent the misuse of the flair that is primarily meant for longform, well-informed, and careful posts, rather than pop-philosophy-type content, short personal observations, and newcomer questions.

Things may change, but we are going to move forward and monitor how well things work. If you have any questions, concerns, or other feedback, feel free to let us know.

"Seneca, Nero, and Christianity","This may be a little off the beaten track of this subreddit, but I'm curious about the... complex relationship between the three. I see this as relevant to this sub as it's related to how stoic ideas have influenced other schools of thought.

Nero was well known for his persecution of Christians, with some pointing at him being viewed as the literal Antichrist.
Seneca was highly influential to many Christians scholars to the point someone most likely forged correspondence (an early example of fanfiction) between him and Paul the Apostle.
We all know how Seneca is seen as a moderating influence on Nero.

EVERYTHING that happens is preordained,"I feel anxious. I have to give a presentation tomorrow and I feel anxious. But that's not what worries me. What worries me is the very fact that I am anxious. I have read meditations hundreds of times, I shouldn't feel this way. I should be armed with the thought that nothing in the universe can happen that is bad, because what the universe creates is guided by the laws of logic and cannot be anything but good.

The problem here is with the ""should"". You simultaneously say that the universe cannot give way to something that is bad but at the same time say that what is happening right now is wrong. The universe is wrong, in this case. Everything that the universe has so far created, the big bang, the birth of humanity, the rise of democracy, have been good and without mistake - until today. You being anxious is the universe's first mistake.

Of course this makes no sense. By ""everything that happens is good"" it follows that your anxiety has to be good. If tomorrow you should feel so anxious that you throw up, that is good. A central problem with this line of thinking has to do with expectation. ""I feel like I have done everything right so I shouldn't be feeling this way."" The hardest part, I think, is truly letting go of this expectation. We practice philosophy or spiritualism or religion because we want to be happy but often it is this goal that gets in the way of that happiness. You will still keep practicing, but remember that it is not up to you how things will go or how you will feel. Feeling bad can be a symptom of a problem that you should try to fix but it is not the feeling itself that you should try to fix or even bother with at all.

Edit: This post isn't about the damned presentation. I dont have anxiety about a presentation. I dont even have a presentation.

On descriptions and prescriptions,"**Introduction**

I’m sure everyone already intuitively knows the difference between prescriptions and descriptions, and can easily explain the difference when asked to. Yet quite often I see people on here struggle to apply this distinction in their Stoic practice.

In this post I will attempt to show this distinction in the context of practicing Stoicism and how one can practice more effectively by keeping it in mind.

**The difference**

The definitions of the words as per the Cambridge dictionary:

Prescription:

>the act of telling someone else what they must have or do.

Description:

>something that tells you what something or someone is like.

In my own understanding, a description is a list of characteristics that is associated with someone or something whereas a prescription is a list of instructions you can follow. We can easily *describe* how it is like for a master musician to play on an instrument, but to *prescribe* the training to attain such skills is a completely different thing.

In the context of training, a description tells you the goal that you wish to attain, and a prescription tells you the process towards  attaining that goal. In the causality chain of events, a description is the consequence and a prescription is an antecedent cause.

What this means is it makes sense to use prescriptions as your practice but not descriptions, and this is really where I see people struggle with.

Consider this simple example. If you sprain an ankle, the description of a “recovered ankle” is “you can run”. Do you then “run” with the sprained ankle so that you match the description of a “recovered ankle”? Of course not, we all have enough common sense to know this is ridiculous. What you do is ""following the doctor’s treatment plan”, or the “prescription”, until “you can run”, at which point you know you have “recovered” because what you can do matches the description. Being able to run is caused by having recovered, which in turn is caused by following the treatment plan.

But “running to recover” is exactly what people are doing when they say something along the lines of “I’m practicing Stoicism by not being disturbed by externals”, or “I’m following the Stoic principle of the cardinal virtues”. Not being disturbed by externals and the virtues are *descriptions* of a practiced Stoic, they are not *prescriptions* for your practice.

Epictetus himself talked about this in the following excerpt:

>But if he has striven merely to attain the state which he finds in his books and works only at that, and has made that the goal of his travels, I bid him go home at once and not neglect his concerns there, since the goal to which he has travelled is nothing; but not so that other goal—to study how a man may rid his life of sorrows and lamentations, and of such cries as ""Woe is me!"" and ""Wretch that I am!"" and of misfortune and failure, and to learn the meaning of death, exile, prison, hemlock; that he may be able to say in prison, ""Dear Crito, if so it pleases the gods, so be it,"" rather than, ""Alas, poor me, an old man, it is for this that I have kept my grey hairs!""

\- The Discourses of Epictetus I.4

I believe this confusion is primarily caused by being introduced to the Meditations as their first Stoic reading material, which brings me to my next point.

**How it applies to the original texts**

As I mentioned just now, I’d bet my money on the Meditations being the primary cause of this confusion. That’s because the Meditations is mostly *descriptive,* there are very few passages in there I can think of that are actually *prescriptive.*

We need to remember, that Marcus had had decades of Stoic training when he wrote it - he was already one of the most well-versed Stoics in human history; and the Meditations was not written to teach others to be like him – it was his private journal. A master guitarist doesn’t need to write down in his journal where to place his fingers on the guitar, he will probably write something like “a 1-minute solo would fit nicely in this segment of this song”.

The Discourses of Epictetus is by far the most *prescriptive* book out of all the remaining original Stoic texts we have. Epictetus is also quite explicit whenever he states his instructions if you read it carefully. Even Marcus himself implied the importance of this book in his Stoic education on the very first page of the Meditations:

>7. From Rusticus: to get an impression of need for reform and treatment of character; not to run off into zeal for rhetoric, writing on speculative themes, discoursing on edifying texts, exhibiting in fanciful colours the ascetic or the philanthropist. To avoid oratory, poetry, and preciosity; not to parade at home in ceremonial costume or to do things of that kind; to write letters in the simple style, like his own from Sinuessa to my mother. To be easily recalled to myself and easily reconciled with those who provoke and offend, as soon as they are willing to meet me. To read books accurately and not be satisfied with superficial thinking about things or agree hurriedly with those who talk round a subject. **To have made the acquaintance of the** ***Discourses*** **of Epictetus, of which he allowed me to share a copy of his own.**

\- The Meditations, book I

There is another anecdotal evidence of this book being a primary education material to the ancient Stoics:

>With these words then the Stoic rid himself of the rich Asiatic. But later, when we were approaching Brundisium and sea and sky were calm, I asked him what the reason for his fear was, which he had refused to reveal to the man who had improperly addressed him. And he quietly and courteously replied: “Since you are desirous of knowing, hear what our forefathers, the founders of the Stoic sect, thought about that brief but inevitable and natural fear, or rather,” said he, “read it, for if you read it, you will be the more ready to believe it and you will remember it better.” **Thereupon before my eyes he drew from his little bag the fifth book of the** ***Discourses*** **of the philosopher Epictetus, which, as arranged by Arrian, undoubtedly agree with the writings of Zeno and Chrysippus.**

\- Aulus Gellius’ The Attic Nights

It should be abundantly clear at this point that the Discourses of Epictetus was amongst the most important Stoic learning materials at the time, and the people back then also had access to the works  of other prominent Stoic figures such as Zeno and Chrysippus. We are fortunate enough to still have access to this book in modern times (albeit half of it is lost), there is simply no reason we shouldn’t follow what the ancients did by using it as our main educational text.

Seneca’s letters and essays are also a decent source of instructional texts. The problem is his love of verbal barrage (he was a famous playwright at the time) means his writings are often very long-winded and in my opinion excessively sophisticated for the purpose of education.

I find his writings more poetic than they are educational, and I often find myself lost in a sort of “trance” when reading his texts, especially his essays. I still struggle to keep track of Seneca’s points when reading his essays to this day.

To me reading Seneca is something I do more for “reading pleasure” for a lack of better words than for learning. Of course that’s just me, if you have a different experience with reading Seneca then by all means do it as part of your learning.

**How we apply it in our Stoic practice**

A marathon runner and a sprinter both share the same goal of being the best at their sport, and thus to train their body to be at its physical peak in the most suitable way for their sport. But the marathon runner is primarily concerned with endurance whereas the sprinter speed. As such their training regimes have to be different.

It is also the case for our Stoic practice. Each of us has a different purpose, a different role to play in the cosmopolis; each of us has a different upbringing, different strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, how we train ourselves in the way of the Stoics must by necessity be different. Again I will quote Epictetus on this same point here:

>I am inclined to pleasure; I will betake myself to the opposite side of the rolling ship, and that beyond measure, so as to train myself. I am inclined to avoid hard work; I will strain and exercise my sense-impressions to this end, so that my aversion from everything of this kind shall cease. For who is the man in training? He is the man who practises not employing his desire, and practises employing his aversion only upon the things that are within the sphere of his moral purpose, yes, and practises particularly in the things that are difficult to master. **And so different men will have to practise particularly to meet different things**.

\- The Discourses of Epictetus III.12

**Conclusion**

In summary, if you wish to make progress in your Stoic training, it is important that you set yourself a description as a goal and devise a prescriptive plan to train yourself towards attaining that goal.

Don’t just start with a far-fetched goal like “I want to be like Marcus Aurelius!”. That’s like watching [a video of Van Halen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULEBSxP725w) and immediately saying “I want to play the guitar like him”, or reading about theoretical Physics for the first time and saying ""I want to win a Nobel prize in Physics!""

Start with something small and managable, something like “I want to stop being a slave to material wealth” if this is one of your weaknesses, then proceed to train yourself to get accustomed to a life with minimal material possessions.

It is also crucial that you are completely honest with yourself about your shortcomings, and be fully committed to follow the plan you devise, in the same vein you have to be completely honest with your doctor about your symptoms and follow her treatment plan if you want to recover most effectively from your illness.

I am affected by what is currently happening in Gaza.,"I feel like nothing makes any sense anymore. How can people sleep comfortably knowing that their fellow human beings are experiencing genocide and children and innocent people are being killed? I feel guilty for having the privilege and resources to achieve my goals, for being able to buy meals, for having a roof over my head. I feel guilty about living. I am so sad for the people suffering and it's out of my control.

**\*\*\*READ THIS\*\*\***

Just because I specifically mentioned Gaza doesn't mean I am not compassionate toward other races and countries too. What is wrong with some of you? I pity both the innocent people of Israel and Palestine. I am also saddened by what has happened in both Ukraine and Russia. I HAVE EMPATHY FOR ALL HUMAN KINDS AND RACES. Why are you all assuming the other way? I DESPISE ALL FORMS OF EVIL. I am not siding with any side; I am against the people who are in charge behind all of this cruelty and those who support these actions.

Just because something worse happened in other countries doesn't mean we shouldn't stand up for other countries too. I don't know wtf happened to compassion. Why can't we all just be fvcking kind.

A Brief Gratitude for Stoicism,"I am from a developing country. If people from the developed world can be... well, untrustworthy, politically polarized, immature, horrible and so on, think developed world - economy and institutions and live with that for the rest of your life. I write this on every post in general so I think this has become essentially a part of my internet identity (and not my oh-so-glamorous IRL identity, unless I see discrimination here) 

So when I'm very grateful for Stoicism and the dichotomy of control. I've read and re-read original stoic texts countless times, with pencils and highlighting and all that good stuff. I would not claim I am an expert but if I've almost a decade of experience with 7 Habits of Effective People, I think I already have had a good introduction to Stoicism. Even the ""later"" stoics (big 3) abandoned stoic physics & stoic logic and just concerned themselves with stoic ethics (Discipline of Action) for the most part.

Stoicism as a school did not survive. But oh my god if we did not have the basic ability to focus on what is up to us (or ""control"") and did not have the ancient authors basically contributing to modern psychotherapy and science... I personally don't know how I'd deal with all the pressure and all my personal demons.

So thanks. I'm practically a first generation lawyer and hopefully will work as a District & Sessions judge before retirement. I think I'll never be called ""Justice <name>"" but that's perfectly fine. So, yeah, thank god for the good people behind stoicism and this sub. Even in this sub itself, things get pretty non-stoic and meta... but I think that's to be expected considering we're all humans and imperfect, like Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius and Cicero. 

So thank god for all the Stoic podcasts, authors, translators, and simply fellow students of this philosophy for sharing very good information with me. The first and foremost principle in Stoicism is the principle of Justice (a virtue) and personally I'd have gone crazy with my unorthodox lifestyle and unconventional life story if it weren't for Stoicism and related philosophies.

Life is suffering,"It is my understanding that the Stoics, similar to the Buddhists, advocate accepting that there is a certain amount of suffering in life.  I believe the Buddhists even say that life **IS** suffering.  Instead of waiting and being put off kilter by life's obstacles, the Stoics advocate premeditatio malorum, a kind of meditation on the negativity that might come your way in a given day.

&#x200B;

I don't use that morning meditation every day.  I tend to remember it when things in my life are trending downward; that's when I'm usually grasping at whatever tools I have to make my life better.  I do find it useful.

&#x200B;

More importantly, for me, is the mere acceptance or acknowledgment that my life circumstances are exactly as they must be, warts and all.  I have some influence, but I cannot control them.   Life cannot be without suffering, so I need to accept it as it is. 

&#x200B;

Similarly too, both the Stoics and Buddhist believe that reality itself is neutral, in terms of its significance, but that it's our judgments about the reality that can cause us to suffer.  I am continually having to remind myself of this truth when I go down the rabbit hole of negativity.

&#x200B;

Being more accepting of life's struggles means less suffering  because I'm not constantly craving what isn't.

I'm a novice student of Stoicism and Buddhism, so I would appreciate any comments that clarify or even correct what I'm trying to say.

The reason is that you’re 18-25. That period of life is exactly when you question everything, as you come out of childhood and start to work out how to be an adult. This is, in short, a very normal way to feel and a very normal process to go through.

I felt like it isn't possible even after they quoted the vices




""Look  back and recall when you were ever sure of your purpose; how few  days turned out as you’d intended; when you were ever at your own  disposal; when your face showed its own expression; when your mind  was free from disturbance; what accomplishment you can claim in  such a long life; how many have plundered your existence without  your being aware of what you were losing; how much time has been  lost to groundless anguish, foolish pleasure, greedy desire, the charms  of society; how little is left to you from your own store of time.

Now it’s basically, “I just broke up with my gf” or “how do I handle getting rejected by my crush?”

Nothing wrong with these questions, they have a place on an Internet forum for sure. But it’s just interesting how much the sub has changed away from actual Stoic focus since I last visited

I have no idea how to handle my breakup.,"We broke up with my partner 2 months ago after 5 years of being together, and my life has been a living hell since then. I lost my job, had to move back in with my parents, I have no friends, everyone in my family is completely unavailable emotionally so I can’t turn to anyone for emotional support and the therapist I’ve been seeing isn’t much help either. (she’s a great person and she’s helped me with other things but I just don’t feel like it helps much with this) Meanwhile she started seeing someone else less than a week after we broke up, and she seems very happy without me in her life. I keep having intrusive thoughts imagining of her enjoying life with her current partner, doing things we used to do together, having sex, etc.

I rediscovered stoicism recently and tried to apply some stoic principles to my situation. I understand that my feelings of jealousy and betrayal come from a misunderstanding of reality. I don’t own or control this person, she is free to do whatever she wants and I should not base my happiness/life on her presence in my life. But I just can’t change how I feel. I also can’t treat this like a learning opportunity, or to become a better person, because I don’t want that. I don’t look forward to anything in life, I just want to escape, I just want it to stop. 

Reason I’m making this post is becaue I have nowhere else to turn and I’m hoping people here may have some advice for me.",Stoicism,1701940113.0,t3_18crodt,0.63,7
Money/savings and frugality.,"Hi, new to stoicism. I'm learning and it's helping me through a rough time.
Anyway.
I'm not a rich man, but I do save well. I'm very frugal generally and have no want for material things. I prefer to travel.

But right now, I need to upgrade my house, it needs repainted, roof is leaky, it's dated.
Fixing it up is going to eat well into my savings and leave me pretty broke, it makes me feel uncomfortable, that I'm spending it all.

So, what is like to know is how a modern stoic would approach the issue.
Would they just spend it and be done?
Or perhaps just leave the house looking as it is? With exception of roof that needs done.",Stoicism,1701939153.0,t3_18crgxx,0.73,5
Should I forgive no matter what?,"Hello everyone, i’m relatively new to stoicism although I have been looking into stoic views for some time now. I am having trouble trying to decide the best course of action for my own mental and for my sports team regarding forgiveness of a teamate. A player on this sports team that I will call Jake brings down the entire team. Not just in a bad attitude towards the game way but in an instigator with his own teammates way. Jake and I were previously pretty close friends even spending some time together outside of our sport. Until Jake started being such a douche that I called him out for it. If you can’t tell yet, Jake isn’t the type of guy to appreciate being called out in front of his peers. We butted heads for many months but never let it affect us on the field. Recently it had gotten much worse as jake said cruel things to my face, gotten physical with me and my belongings/equipment, and tried to convince teamates I didn’t belong on the team. Now I am a pretty level headed guy, I didn’t let this affect me as I felt sorry for him because he is obviously lacking in some department to have to go after someone like this. What I refused to let happen was my image with others be tampered and for Jake to affect the chemistry of the team where it affects us in game play. During this period I looked at stoicism for guidance and I think I did the right thing. Not once did I raise my voice at Jake, lay my hands on jake, or even talk badly about jake to others. I reasoned that Jake is feeling a certain way and needs to take it out on others. 

Now I will skip some time and get to the part where i need advice. Jake came up to me personally and grabbed my hand shaking it and said “i’m sorry for being such a bad teammate, im working on it” I didn’t say “It’s okay” as being a bad teammate is not okay but i thanked him for his apology. My question is, in stoic principle should I be accepting Jake back into my life as a friend?",Stoicism,1701924045.0,t3_18cnmvp,0.67,4
How (24m) to get over oneitis/crush (22f) that’s completely out of my league?,"So, I’ve \[24M\] had this intense crush on this woman \[22F\] for about 3 years now. I don’t know her personally, but we have some mutual friends and I’ve seen her at certain events here and there like house parties and such.

She’s so beautiful and pretty and I’ve been infatuated with her ever since I saw her. The problem is, is that she’s completely out of my league. She’s a well-known dancer in our community and has thousands of followers on her Instagram and TikTok. She’s super popular with many friends and a great social life, comes from a nice supportive family and rich background.

Meanwhile, there’s me, a 24-year-old loser virgin that’s still in university and living with his parents. I only have 3 friends and a lackluster social life. I have no relationship experience whatsoever due to my struggles with my mental health and abusive home situation that has held me back tremendously. I’m poor and broke and I have a lot of acne scars on my face that makes me really ugly. Not to mention I’m short as well.

Basically, I have no chance with her and I really want to accept that instead of constantly pining for her and stalking her Instagram. How do I get over this unrequited crush?

My criticism of Stoicism,"My criticism has to do with the emphasis that the ancient stoic sages gave to various virtues. Early stoicism was greatly influenced by Socratic piety and its virtue ethics of justice, temperance, courage, and wisdom. Aristotelian ethics also greatly influenced the stoics. Aristotle proposed the following nine virtues: wisdom, prudence, justice, fortitude, courage, liberality, magnificence, magnanimity, and temperance. 

Absent in these virtues and the stoic writings is the virtue of agape. This is a selfless, unconditional love that transcends romantic or familial love. This love is central to Christian theology. The core texts on this love are the sermon on the mount, attributed to Jesus, and the writing of the apostle Paul. 

A parallel to agape or “Christian love” can be found in eastern wisdom traditions as well. In Buddhism, especially the Theravada tradition, they emphasize Metta or the cultivation of boundless, unconditional love and goodwill toward all living beings.

Now the stoics did emphasize benevolence and kindness towards others, but the conception of agape is never a central part of the stoic ethic. I consider myself a novice practicing stoic, and have found that as I continue to learn and grow, my practice of virtue has been improved as I have worked to prioritize the development of agape.",Stoicism,1701914706.0,t3_18ckotn,0.7,7

"""Each man is as wretched as he has convinced himself he is.""","I've just started reading The Practicing Stoic by Ward Farnsworth.  The full quote of Seneca, in the book, is (p. 39 of the Kindle version) ""'Everything depends on opinion.  Ambition, luxury, greed, all look back to opinion.  it is according to opinion that we suffer.  Each man is as wretched as he has convinced himself he is.  Seneca, Epistles 78. 13.'""  When I first read this Stoic sentiment a couple years ago it was like an epiphany.  What do you mean that my/other's judgments about life and about me are not Truth.  They are just impermanent opinions holding no inherent value or weight.  That I somehow had the power to choose a different interpretation of the so-called facts was a revelation.

Prior to that, and other readings I was doing, I was so unconscious that I was often-times ensnared by my thinking, believing it was my reality (even when objective facts contradicted my thoughts); instead of being aware of the thinker, with the power to change my thoughts, or to not think at all, i.e., meditate or be mindful.

Now I wish I could say that I no longer get ensnared by my thoughts, which in turn can get me down, but at least now I'm more quickly able to intercede and question the runaway thoughts.  Thank goodness for the philosophers to help us lead a more meaningful life.",Stoicism,1701898132.0,t3_18cernq,0.97,37
Stoicism can be a replacement for therapy,"Around my house I can fix things like leaky faucets and dead vacuums, but if a problem brings me close to electrical main lines I call an electrician. I'm happy to do it, but I'd never call him over to change a light bulb---it's faster, cheaper, better for me to do it myself. Some people are more handy than me and can build a house, others can't flip a breaker.

So it is with stoicism---and most moral philosophies---and mental health. Problems of the mind are the stuff of life; we all try to fix destructive behavior, figure out life goals, cope with grief, reconcile a traumatic event, and more. Sometimes the problem is small, sometimes it's big. A big problem faced by a young man whose seen little of the world and has no philosophy calls for talking to someone. A small problem faced by a woman steeped in a good philosophy is nothing for her to handle on her own. 

I've had my share of hardship, and stoic ideas often kept my mind right. Its not hard for me to think of a world where I hadn't pored over this philosophy and so found myself needing help.

Stoicism and art?,"Just finished Meditiations for the first time, and I could only find one brief passage about the relationship between Marcus and art. In one passage, can’t remember which one, MA mentioned music, and how if one were to break down a piece into each one of its notes, they could not affect him on their own. From this combined with Marcus telling himself to stop reading books, I infer that he does not believe that art is “good.” While Marcus did ‘cite’ several plays and literary works, this was the only passage I could find in direct relation to it so if someone can find more I would appreciate it.
Here is my core dilemma: I understand that one of the base precepts of stoicism is to not indulge in pleasures. To only seek clarity of the mind and to do the right thing for humanity, as your nature demands of you.  If this is the case, however, how does one justify the pursuit of beauty and art, or in our modern era entertainment such as movies and TV?",Stoicism,1701897873.0,t3_18ceo04,0.67,1

Is resilience necessary?,"In a conversation here today, the idea of resilience was discussed and it was put to me that resilience is an important thing in Stoicism. I agreed at the time, but on reflection I wonder whether I was wrong. 

The word resilient has always suggested something springy to me, a surface which can be struck and bounce back, like a sapling or a good mattress. In humans, resilience is the ability to weather difficulty and recover from adversity. 

However, the Sage does not experience anything she considers adversity. Winds blow but they do not push her back. Correctly judging all circumstances, she has no need to be resilient because she experiences no suffering. 

Of course none of us are a Sage, but I wonder if resilience is the wrong thing for a student of Stoicism to strive towards. If we are affected enough to need resilience, presumably there is a flaw in our reasoning which needs to be addressed.

Seneca - is there 20 books comprising letters to lucilius,"Hi 

So I'm reading letters of seneca and I have been fascinated by the legend and I thought of reading further more about him, 
I asked chat gpt how many books are there from seneca

And this was the output ! So is there actually each letters from penguin Classics are written in a bigger format as in 20 books? Or am I missing any information? 

Certainly! Seneca's ""Letters to Lucilius"" (Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium) are commonly organized into 20 books. Each ""book"" contains a set of letters, and in total, there are 124 letters. 

Here's a simplified breakdown of the organization:

Books 1-9: These books contain the majority of the letters, with each book consisting of a varying number of letters addressing different philosophical topics and life advice.Books 10-12: These books include letters on various subjects, continuing the themes of earlier books.

Books 13-16: These books are sometimes considered separately as ""On Groundless Fears,"" as they primarily focus on dealing with fears and anxieties.

Books 17-20: These books contain the final set of letters, exploring various Stoic principles and life lessons.",Stoicism,1701881816.0,t3_18c8e29,0.67,1

Stoicism helps with depression,"
I will never make the claim that Stoicism is a tried and true ""cure"" to depression and/or suicidal ideation. However, I know that the lessons I personally have learned through philosophy as a whole, and Stoicism in particular, have helped me grow a lot in the last few months.

I have my low days still but I have learned how to face those thoughts and feelings from a far more practical view by changing my judgement. Every day I make the choice to allow those thoughts to run rampant or challenge them by seeing them ""for what they are"" as Marcus Aurelius put it. It's not necessarily that Stoicism cured me, it just gave me the tools to confront something I believed was bigger than myself for a long time.

Choose not to be harmed—and you won’t feel harmed. Don’t feel harmed—and you haven’t been.,"I like this quote. I come back to it often. I wanted to know if I am applying it correctly after certain situations. 

For example. Every so often I will get into a negative confrontation which leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I tend to obsessive about things in gerneral. Be overly sensitive. Deem everything as a slight at times. I don't want to drone on but someone posted a post something like stoicism is not therapy or substitute for it. And it's not.

Basically I went to a store I do deliveries for they know me. I asked the employee for an additional plastic bag to keep something warm. And he would just not want to do it. Said we can't?

5. That during my Mental Health assessment the assessor would think I'm mental and report me
6. The Bus Home from work leaves early (As usual)

The issues I had trying to apply stoic principles,"This year I started my stoic journey and I've been enjoying it so far. I feel better overall, but the thing I like the most about stoicism is that I have guidance or some sort of ""framework"" on how to behave on any given situation, which facilitates making tough decisions.

One issue I struggled with for some time is knowing what would be ""the stoic way"" to handle certain scenarios I faced in my life. And this was an issue for two reasons:

1. I would have to search for a specific teaching/quote/insight on stoic books that would relate to the situation I'm going through. This is not easy since most stoic books (at least the most popular ones) aren't structured in an organized way. They're mostly just a bunch of teachings with no particular order or association to a specific subject.
2. Once I found some quote or teaching, it was hard to clearly understand the underlying message. I'm kind of new to philosophy, so most times the language used was difficult for me to understand.

So I ended up building an app that would help me with that. I'm not intending to do self-promotion so I wont share any particular details, but I imagine if its helping me now, it can potentially help others.

So I would like to know what people practicing Stoicism think about the concept and what I could do to make it useful to others, so I can share it through the appropriate channels.

It works as follow:

1. You enter some situation you're going through your life. Could be anything, from minor things that happen on your day-to-day to more meaningful situations that affect your overall wellbeing.
2. The app scan through a set of stoic books looking for quotes or teachings that relate to your scenario.
3. Using AI, the app display's the following:
   1. The quote extracted from the books, exactly as it was taken from the source.
   2. The quote explained in plain english. No complex or ancient language, the quote is explained as a friend would explain it to you.
   3. An explanation of how a stoic would handle the situation you're going through. Everything based on the quote mentioned in point no. 1.

# Example

**My scenario:**

*I'm working on expanding my social circle and building meaningful friendships. It's not easy for me to connect with new people and maintain those relationships since I'm very shy*

**The quote taken from books:**

*Judge no speech or action unworthy of you which is consistent with nature. Be not dissuaded by any consequent criticism or censure from others; but, if the speech or action be honourable, judge yourself worthy to say or do it. Those who criticize you have their own conscience and their own motives. These you are not to regard, but follow a straight course, guided by your own nature and the nature of the Universe, both of which point the same way.*

**The quote explained:**

Do not let the opinions or criticisms of others discourage you from pursuing actions that are in line with your own nature and the nature of the Universe. If your intentions are honorable, consider yourself worthy of engaging in those actions or expressing those thoughts. The judgments and motives of others should not influence your decisions, as they have their own perspectives and motivations. Instead, stay true to yourself and follow the path that aligns with your nature and the greater order of the Universe.

**The quote in the context of my scenario:**

In your scenario of expanding your social circle and building meaningful friendships, it is important to remember that you should not let the shyness or potential criticism from others deter you from connecting with new people. The quote emphasizes that you should not judge your own actions or words as unworthy simply because they may be met with criticism or disapproval. Instead, if your intentions are genuine and honorable, you should consider yourself worthy of making the effort to connect with others and build meaningful relationships. The opinions and judgments of others should not hinder your pursuit of social connections, as they have their own perspectives and motivations. Stay true to your own nature and the natural inclination for human connection, and do not let external factors discourage you from taking action.

How a stoic handle a thief?,"Here in philippines we have an delivery app that still accepts cash on delivery.

Stoicism is not a replacement for therapy.,"As the title says.

Stoicism is not a replacement for medical intervention. It can replace mental healthy therapy as much as it can replace physical therapy.

It can be an brilliant *companion* to medical intervention as you navigate recovery from any given problem, but it is not a replacement.

Remember, a stoic seeks to understand the world around us. To prioritise knowledge and wisdom above all else. 

There is a wealth of quality, validated research on mental health treatments.

The moment we reject the best established science in favour of *our own interpretation of a philosophy* is the moment we stop being rational, and start treating stoicism as a faith.

This is not just for the very large amount of people coming here seeking stoicism as a replacement for therapy, but directed at the far too many people encouraging using stoicism as a replacement for therapy.

The stoics once believed gravity was that objects are compelled to return to their natural resting point as an innate property of the object itself - A rock belongs on the floor so it is compelled to return there! A good stoic does not go ""No, Newton is wrong... it's not mass attracts mass"", so don't do it for medical science.",Stoicism,1701776416.0,t3_18ba5bk,0.95,513

50. Do your best to convince them. But act on your own, if justice mures i. If met with force, then ice back on acceprance and percability. Use the setback to practice other virtues.
Remember that our efforts are subject to circumstances; you reren't aiming to do the impossible.
-Aiming to do what, then?
To try. And you succeeded. What you set out to do is accom-plished.

51. Ambition means tying your well-being to what other people say or do.
Self-indulgence means tying it to the things that happen to you.
Sanity means tying it to your own actions.

52. You don't have to turn this into something. It doesn't have to upset you. Things can't shape our decisions by themselves.

53. Practice really hearing what people say. Do your best to get inside their minds.

54. What injures the hive injures the bee.

"Genuinely curious, why should I live if no one can love me","I don’t have a single friend. They all abandoned me for various reasons or they betrayed me. I always was treated like an option or just a background character. Never treated like a *friend*. I’ve never had a boyfriend or a girlfriend before because I am physically unattractive. I’m 24 and female. My relationship with my immediate family has been diminishing since I’ve been completely alone for years. 

I’ve never felt proper love. I’ve been alone, ignored, treated like shit by nearly everyone around me, stranger or not. I can’t make friends, but either way, I don’t really want to because I can’t trust or tolerate anyone anymore after being alone for so long. No one understands that my life is over, there is no hope or “right people” for me. It’s either gas myself (I already have a suicide plan) or live the rest of my life alone, depressed and struggling.

I’ve met so many people and befriended them. Only for a temporary time. And I’m still completely alone. My personality is bitter and angry, nothing can change that. My life is truly over and no. Like I said. It’s not going to change. I’ve been like this since I left high school.

It’s all coming to an end…,"I’m a 20 year old, soon to be 21 (maybe)male  and I feel that my life has come to an end. 

For as long as I can remember, I’ve always known I would die young. Whether that be by nature, an accident or my own hands, I knew it was going to happen. I wasn’t a very lucky child. I had my first “sexual” experience at 5, with my two other male cousins. It was the turning point in my life. From then on it has been nothing but a downhill slope from there. I like to be around children and keep them happy and to make sure that nothing harms them. That they can stay their innocent and happy selves, wish someone would’ve had done that with me. Turns out from the three of us, I was the only one to develop feelings for guys even though it was never my idea nor did I like it. I’ve always felt dirty ever since then. From then on I consumed every food that caught my eyes because for some reason, that was what kept me from thinking about how “guilty” I felt.  I got older, fatter, yet always knew how to entertain a crowd. From 7-18 it was nothing but yo-yo diets, feeling insecure like any other teenager and simple unrequited crushes. I just kind of gave up then. Did I mention I am in the closet of an extremely homophobic, highly Christian-conservative household? Well I am. And even when I try to be careful I always make mistakes, that costs my family a lot (sometimes a lot of money too) I’m really sorry for that. I have a dream. Not that big of a dream but I had one. That one day, in my mid twenties I would move away to a foreign country, with a language I can not speak, preferably japan, and move to a quiet small beach town and just work at a cafe, free from anything, everyone. Somewhere where I can start all over again. Be clean. But that dream got crushed the moment I realized that I can move away from my situation,but I can never move away from my mind. This wasn’t a cry for help. Nothing can help me anymore. I love my family more than anything but I wish I could get murdered just so that they won’t face the pain of not truly knowing what storm laid inside my heart which made me wanted to kill myself. Maybe this story lands somewhere with someone who’s struggling with the same things maybe my story that didn’t have such a happy ending could mean the world to someone’s who could.

Core precepts/values and virtues - clarification please,"Bear with me here as I may be using the terms incorrectly.

Epictetus advised us to have core precepts to guide us in our daily lives.

Let's say we choose things such as: Being mindful and intentional. Staying in our power (not letting others sway us); being disciplined etc

Is the assumption correct that the virtues Temperance, Wisdom, Courage, Justice aren't core values as such but are what underpin our core values? Therefore the virtues are the foundations that help us with our core values?

Suppressing emotions,"Hey there,
Am 17 and I am relatively new to stoicism I had lot of trouble while traveling the journey of life,
The problem is that I feel like,I am emotionally weak at times I can't control my anger.whenever I feel angry.I try to control myself but there are times when I have meltdowns whenever I supress my angry for way too long(happens rarely tho).there was this kid from  my class whose bigger than me usually makes fun of me(dudes a bully) most of the time around my classmates,one day we got into an argument and I never were good at arguments,
So I started throwing hands with him and I somehow managed to knock the dude out with a single scratch but even tho I felt sense of happiness after that,later on post realisation hit me like a truck after realising the collatral damage I have created(I accidentally hurt my friends who were trying to seperate us).even tho he was the one who started all of this mess,i apologised to everyone present there.whenever I let my anger control myself I have no memories of the event also I could have accidentally severly injured the guy if I choked him any longer

So I don't want anger to control myself there were many instances similar to this.i always try my best not to cause any trouble and I try my best to avoid being angry at people.but unfortunately I get into fights way often considering how emotionally unstable I am and my mom asked what would happen if I accidentally kill someone if I let my anger control me(as there were similar events just like this)and the question still revolves in my head.

How can one be virtuous if they have a bad moral compass,"Hi all, 

I have been practicing Stoicism for a couple years now but have a question regarding the philosophy which I can’t figure out (probably due to my inexperience/knowledge) The philosophy is more broadly a practical one rather than theoretical one, and encourages people to learn through experience rather than pure study, ‘waste no time arguing what a good man should be. Be one’ 

How does this work if you have an objectively bad moral compass but don’t realise it, I.e. think you are doing the right thing, but are actually causing more harm to people than good, but in your eyes you are practicing stoicism. 

Doesn’t this idea mean we should actually debate what is right and wrong to broaden our understanding of virtue?",Stoicism,1701682535.0,t3_18agpnx,0.72,7
Stoicism Vs. Unconditional Forgiveness,"There’s a man named Cliffe Knechtle, a pastor. I came across a video of his which speaks on “forgiveness” and if it has limits. I wanted to make an attempt to respond to how I *think* a practicing stoic would. I would love the insight of others, and the assistance with realigning wherever I may fall short. 

Interviewer: “When does God say “No more, I can’t forgive you for this.”?

Cliff: “I used to work in a prison at Lawrence Massachusetts. Every monday night I would go there, and I first would go into the cell of a man in protective custody who kidnapped little boys, sexually abused him, and murdered him. And after being with him I would go into the basketball gym to play basketball with the other inmates and they would come up to me and say, “Cliffe how can you even talk to such a piece of dirt, don’t you know what he did?” And I say, “Yes I do know what he did, pretty horrendous, pretty grotesque, pretty evil, but he still is a human being created in the image of God, and god offers him forgiveness as horrible as that is. Now there’s a part of me that doesn’t like that, cause I’ve never kidnapped little boys, sexually molested him and murdered him, so I think I’m better. No unfortunately I’m not better, Because in my own sophisticated erudite way I have rebelled against God. I am in desperate need of God’s Grace, his forgiveness, and for me to look down on a guy like that and and say, “Oh, you’re just so inferior, you’re just a piece of dirt” No, he’s a human being created in the image of God, that image has been horribly defaced, horribly, but he still is a human being created in the image of God and God offers him forgiveness.”

- The man in question kidnapped, molested and murdered little boys. This in itself is considered an indifference/external. So, it’s how we use what has happened that is ‘good’ or ‘bad’. ‘Good’ would be to lock this person up or prevent them from doing what they’ve done again in any way possible. ‘Bad’ would be to *not* prevent this person from doing what they’ve done again, in whatever way possible. 

- If we were in a position to choose whether to speak to the criminal, or to…*not* speak to them, the choice is dependent on whether or not doing so would be an act of virtue, with virtue being assigned to what is dependent on our will. If this is the case, then the decision on whether we speak to him or not makes no difference, but how we act within each choice *does* make the difference. If we decided to speak to him, what would be the virtuous way to do so? 

“*You say, “Philosophers talk paradoxes” But are there no paradoxes in the other arts? and what is more paradoxical than to puncture a man’s eye in order that he may see? If anyone said this to a man ignorant of the surgical art, would he not ridicule the speaker? Where is the wonder then if in philosophy also many things which are true appear paradoxical to the inexperienced?*” Epictetus, Discourse 1.25 “On the Same”. 

Based on this quote, I’ve concluded that if I listened to my impression then yes, I would choose not to speak to him because doing so would be bad. However, if my purpose in speaking with the criminal was to learn about why he did it and to prevent it from occurring again, then it would be the right way to act. If I chose to speak to him only to remind him of how shitty of a person is and throw insults at him, this would be *bad* because I am harming my own character by doing this. —— The inexperienced in this case would be the prisoners that question why Cliff even speaks to the man. (?)

-  “*Now there’s a part of me that doesn’t like that, cause I’ve never kidnapped little boys, sexually molested him and murdered him, so I think i’m better. No unfortunately I’m not better, because in my own sophisticated erudite way I have rebelled against God*”. It seems that within Christianity, Rebelling against God = acting without virtue. At least, if our decision to think “I’m better than this guy” leads us to act without virtue, then it is bad. So, am I better than this child, Lester? The truth is: It doesn’t matter. 

- Finally, forgiveness. Would I/Should I forgive? Well, it’s not even my place to forgive. This would be desiring what belongs to others which is a no no. If it WERE my place to forgive (ex. I’m the child that was murdered), whether I forgive or not is…no?

How to overcome severe emotional and physical suffering alongside chronic pain,"I (19M) have been through multiple rough patches in my life. To summarize, I struggled with bullying and loneliness as a child. My home country is going through a civil war, and my father has lost all his life savings and our family's wealth and committed suicide after I tried to stop him (but clearly didn't do enough). So, at the mere age of 16, my family fell apart, and we became semi-broke. Add that to the grief of my losing my father and the trauma from the event. This was during COVID-19, so the physical isolation did not really help.

But, throughout all of this, I still managed to succeed in school and gained admission to a top university in the US with a full scholarship. Being the oldest son, I was always the one expected to perform, and I always had a goal of giving back to my mother. During my time at university, I also managed to get a great GPA and pursued multiple internships throughout my summers and during the semesters. I had a carefully crafted plan to reach my goals, and I was determined to succeed despite everything.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Fast forward to the beginning of my most important semester yet, the one where I have to apply for my junior internships and the one where I have to take the hardest yet most important courseload. I started developing pain in my testicles; being the diligent person I am, I saw a specialist the next day of that happening. I got prescribed antibiotics, yet after completing a course of 3 weeks, the pain never went away. But I was determined not to let this pain stop me from pursuing my goals. A month later, after being in constant pain and going to 3 different doctors, I started having pain in my right testicle; this pain was excruciating. I immediately went to the ER, where they conducted imaging and lab tests and concluded nothing was wrong, so I was sent on my way. But the pain never really subsided. After countless ER and specialist visits, I was found to have a blood clot in my right-sided scrotum, which is apparently so rare only 25 cases have been previously documented. I took my meds, but the constant pain never really went away. It seems the condition is ""resolved,"" i.e., they can't find the clots anymore. But here I am left with a constant pain that often turns excruciating over the course of 4 months with no doctor seeming to help and hope of relief in the future.

&#x200B;

I couldn't apply for internships, and my academics suffered greatly to the point where I started failing classes; I am now experiencing severe depression and chronic pain. My body is always tired and fatigued. I can't help but think of my friends and colleagues who are all leading everyday nice lives, and some of whom are succeeding in the way I dreamt and worked so hard to achieve.

I now live alone and practically isolated, away from family, severely depressed, bedridden, and in chronic pain. My life fell apart, and I have lost my dreams and goals.

How would a stoic approach this predicament? How can I train my mindset to continue pushing through these problems?

Been experiencing anger issues lately.,"I moved here in Romania recently and today has marked 2 months since my arrival, I started a ""new life"" as some may say, with a better job and out of the ghetto, I came here to take care of my grandma because she raised me and I want to honor my grandfather who died this year, a true orthodox family man. 

But I made a lot of sacrifices to come here, I was used to having dozens of friends, now I have like two, my girlfriend of one year and a half broke up with me because I decided to go and take care of my family and a long distance was ""too much"" for her despite me being willing to make a 1100km trip just to see her every month. 

And apparently this, plus the job I work which is indeed pretty easy but is a hard to master skill, have made me notice I've been becoming way angrier than I was. 

I have my father's explosive anger and my mother's vengefulness, which may indeed be assets at times but the explosive part is making me want to punch the shit out of anything that doesn't work within 2 seconds. 

I already go to the gym..i think i will start boxing since im interested in it and punching is literally my immediate reflex to anything nowadays for some reason. 

But I'd want also a more in depth opinion of the Stoics of how I could handle this. 

I've also been told at work that I look very angry, and obviously i do when i don't hit the targets needed immediately even tho I've been told I'm very good for my first month I am still quite competitive.

Struggling with sexual desire and buying sex,"Although sex is a normal thing, as a single virgin 28M am struggling with it. Ideal solution would be to have a stable relationship with someone, and i can do it if i pursue. But i come from a conservative background where my parents won't accept it. I have been seeing a few woman online chat/call upon their recommendation, but i live in abroad (in a more liberal society), so the communication gap with the other people matters a lot. I have been away from my family over 5 years. I do need physical affection and love and hug in this single life (friends are not enough). I don't see myself getting married soon, and i have been seriously considering buying instead of wasting my 20s youth time just like that. Can’t deny that this sex drive may have affected my work. Ethically i am against porn and trafficking. But i am not sure what would be of me if i buy sex. In the end, i don't think i will find any open-minded woman who will accept my ""past sex-buying"" experience. 

&#x200B;

I think male sex drive is uniquely high. We can disregard it focusing on productive works, but that never vanishes the urge. The urge is like a pitfall, you will fall to it naturally if you roam near it, if the atmosphere provokes yourself. Then how do i confront this hidden energy? Whether i accept myself or obtain strategies to be blind to the sex drive- that's what i wonder.",Stoicism,1701645800.0,t3_18a6gcx,0.45,0
Accept or Adverse,"Too often do I hear and read from so called professionals, gurus, mentors, authors, priests, etc 
That Stoicism is too passive of a practice and relies to heavy on determinism and apathy therefore having no effect on the conscience mind that is constantly trying to progress. For reference, Iv read E, S, and MA more times than I can count and continue to read them daily alongside my Bible. This is my path as a Prokopton.  What really grinds my gears is for the high level articles and pundits to give the observation that we are to accept all that happens to us. Blasphemy! I see it here in this Reddit group more than I can count and I hope this post will serve as my response in future discourses. 


“The true man is revealed in difficult times. So when trouble comes, think of yourself as a wrestler whom God, like a trainer, has paired with a tough young buck. For what purpose? To turn you into Olympic-class material.” Epictetus

“What would have become of Hercules, do you think, if there had been no lion, hydra, stag or boar – and no savage criminals to rid the world of? What would he have done in the absence of such challenges? Obviously he would have just rolled over in bed and gone back to sleep. So by snoring his life away in luxury and comfort he never would have developed into the mighty Hercules.” Epictetus

What I’m saying is, giving the response of “it’s not in my control” isn’t an all encompassing response to difficulty. The message that so many miss. Mainly the dichotomy of control isn’t just about recognizing what is external or internal so you can disregard uncontrollable events, it’s about recognizing what you can/need to take action on.

No freedom in life.," 

I dont want to bore y'all with details, so in short, I am 19F. My mother doesn't give me much freedom to go outside home alone unless its college/work. This lack of autonomy has resulted in a pretty boring life, and zero life outside academics. It gets quite mundane, but my thoughts entertain me. However, a time frequently comes where I have reject my friends' invitations to outings/meetups/malls/college programs, etc and that's when I realize that I have no liberty in my life, causing emotional pain and pity like no other. Its been years now, I believe I should be used to it.

There's isn't much I can do about it either, I have tried reasoning things out multiple time and it doesn't end well. I can only move out at 24-25 (Our culture doesn't allow moving out either but I have a plan figured out). Logically it is easy to convince myself that I can't do much about it but it doesn't ease the emotional pain, specially when I have relive this while explaining to situations to friends, or think of the memories I could have made.

The only thing I end up doing is distracting myself from pain by social media or video games. I see no other way out.

How can stoicism help me? How can I reframe my pity party? Its really hard to think outside my bubble of thoughts currently.",Stoicism,1701614486.0,t3_189uuz8,0.82,25
"Logos, the mind, and change","**TLDR**:

If you're dissatisfied with your circumstances and you want to change your dissatisfaction, you have to change either your reasoning process to change your judgements about your circumstances, the circumstances themselves, or a combination of both. The rest of the title is only ~~for the nerds~~ a click-bait.

**Full post**:

I’ve noticed a common pattern in advice posts where the posters ask how to be content about a situation in life they’re obviously dissatisfied with, yet they insist on changing neither their desire nor their situation. Typically they mention doing Stoic “practices” such as “acceptance of fate”, “negative visualisation”, “dichotomy of control”, etc.

In this post I will try to explain why none of these “practices” by themselves have any causal effects on contentment by relating to the concept of Logos and the Stoic theory of the mind.

***Logos***

Logos is defined as “the rational principle governing the universe” ([source](https://iep.utm.edu/stoicism/#SH2b)). The word “rational” here means explainable, consistent, causal, and deterministic. In other words the opposite of true random chance. Note that the ancients didn’t come up with the abstract concept “rational” and looked for things existing in the universe that they could apply this concept on. It’s the other way around – they observed that things existing in the universe follow a causal pattern and they described the phenomenon as “rational”.

This “rational” characteristic of the universe is what allows us to thrive using our “rational” mind. We are the only animal species that’s capable of comprehending this “rationality” permeating throughout the universe and using it to our advantage.

It might be difficult to wrap your head around this concept because it’s the only observable universe    we have access to. To understand what an “irrational” universe would be like, consider these thought experiments:

* What if gravity switches between pulling and pushing completely randomly?
* What if fire switches between generating and absorbing heat completely randomly?
* What if the Earth changes its shape between sphere, cubicle, pyramid, flat, cylinder, etc completely randomly?

When you consider these possibilities you will see how impossible it is for us humans the way we are now to live in such a universe.

Personally I prefer to understand Logos as a combination of mathematical rules (as opposed to linguistic rules) and natural laws (as opposed to man-made laws).

***The*** ***mind***

The ancient Stoics believed that the mind was purely physical ([source](https://iep.utm.edu/stoicmind/#SH2a)). Scholars haven't reached an agreement on whether this means strictly what we now call “[materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism)” or something else entirely. Regardless of what this belief should be called, they agree the Stoics believed the mind is a thing that is made up of physical materials and thus follows the physical laws of the universe.

What this means is the mind isn’t only capable of comprehending the “rationality” of the universe, it operates based on the same “rational” principle itself. The short version of the Stoic theory of mind in relation to this principle is as follow:

* We perceive external stimuli in the form of perceptions.
* We combine these perceptions with our existing beliefs (which by themselves are formed through the same “rational” principle) to form judgements (or also called impressions).
* Our emotions are a result of these judgements. Some think emotions are how the mind perceive the judgements (or how the judgements “feel”), some think they are caused by the judgements, some others think they are side-effects (or by-products) of judgements. In any case there is an inseparable link between our judgements and emotions.

There is much more to the Stoic theory of the mind but for the purpose of this post this short description will suffice. The important lesson we want to take from this is that our judgements and emotions are caused by the application of our reasoning process when combining our perceptions of reality with our existing beliefs.

***Change***

With the knowledge of how the mind works in Stoicism, the question that follows is how do we change our emotions? Given that emotions are caused by 2 factors (or variables): our beliefs and the facts about reality (our circumstances), it logically follows that our emotions will change if and only if there are changes in those factors.

As a software engineer, when I learned about the Stoic theory of mind I immediately related it to how I have always approached my software. The software is programmed in a certain way (my beliefs), this programming reflects my understanding of the business requirements, the programming operates on fundamental mathematics and logic (Logos). Given a set of input (circumstances) the software always produces the same set of output (emotions). If the output doesn’t match my expectation (a bug in software engineering terms), then I will proceed to think about whether I should change my input or my programming, or both (sometimes I also change business requirements, but that also falls under changing my ""beliefs"").

If you can’t relate to my software analogy, try to think of it like a mathematical function f(x) = y, where:

* f denotes a transformation function which contains formulas (beliefs), which adhere to mathematical laws (logos) such as commutative, associative, distributive, and so on.
* x is a variable (circumstances).
* y is the result of transforming x with the function f (emotions).

This means if you want a different result, let’s call y’, you have to change either the input to x’, or the function to f’, or again both.

If it’s still hard to relate, let’s try another analogy. Suppose you want to get inside a room behind a closed door. You turn the knob clockwise. You pull it inwards and it doesn’t open. At this point you can try one of the followings if you still want to get inside the room:

* Turn the knob anti-clockwise.
* Push the door outwards.
* Assert if it’s possible that the door is locked from the inside, if so:
   * Is there a keyhole, and if so where is the key?
   * Is there an alternative way to get inside the room without going through that door (is there a side entrance, a window with which you can climb into the room, and so on)?
* ~~Kick it open.~~

In summary, the point I’m trying to make with this post is that if you feel a certain way about something and you want to change how you feel, then you have to change something that directly contributes to how you feel about it, be it your beliefs or the thing itself. If you change neither and insist on seeing a change in how you feel, you will certainly fail because you will be trying to fight against the laws of the universe. It will be like repeatedly hitting the switch of a broken light bulb hoping that eventually it will light up.",Stoicism,1701595664.0,t3_189q0lt,0.89,28
How to reconcile this?,"Stoicism says you can only control your internals like your own thoughts, actions & reactions.

But are we truly in control of our thoughts & actions? Our actions at any given moment are influenced by so many factors like our general upbringing, our traumas, desires, aversions, our surrounding environment, our biological disposition  & many more and most of these factors are beyond our control. 

Same goes for our thoughts.

Then how am I really in control of my thoughts and actions?

Even me stumbling upon ideas of stoicism wasn't in my control. One day Youtube decided to recommend me a video of stoicism and that point I was in a mood to watch a self help video.

So at best Stoicism can be an emotion management tool which requires many perceptual adjustments to really internalize it in one's life.

Embarking on 'Our Journey of Self-Improvement and Collaboration,"I find myself at a juncture in life where cultivating virtues has become imperative. I've taken strides in developing habits, yet maintaining consistency and identifying my shortcomings prove challenging.

I'm afraid of losing my income. How do I redirect my thoughts?,"I know that it's outside of my control, regardless of how hard I work and perform, I could still lose my income.

My problem is that I feel that this fear is preventing me from applying to other companies because I start imagining scenarios where I wouldn't fit in and get fired from that new company.

(2) I could probably earn more
(3) I feel like I will never be promoted at this company, as my application was rejected twice already in the past two years.

Is stoicism working for you?,"Don't know when you guys realized that stoicism is really helping you, but for me it clicked when I realized a few years ago that I was no longer overly afraid to die. 

&#x200B;

I used to struggle with the idea that I was sick with something, any tiny symptom that I had I would think I had some sort of bad cancer. Practicing negative visualization in the beginning helped me big time with that, only 10 minutes every morning, but making it a routine. It helped me understand that during the day when any negative thought came I didn't need to think about, I could simply talk myself into waiting for tomorrow's session. I realized I was becoming a much less anxious person, to the point now that I have to, for example, to do the opposite and force myself to go to the doctor to have some regular checkups, otherwise I won't even bother.

&#x200B;

It's still not perfect though, I still struggle at work, for example, to keep it cool when I'm confronted with something, when my boss does something I don't like... I still let this kind of stuff get to me. Even though it is a little better, I still see this as a big area of improvement. I can't for example receive an email that triggers some reaction on me, put it on my to do list, and carry on with the next task. I keep thinking about it until I reply it, and sometimes my answer is not the greatest as I'm still emotional when I reply to it.

&#x200B;

Obviously I know I will never be a sage, there are some areas where you excel, others that you find more difficult, but after 5 years practicing stoicism, I can say that it really helps me big time, and it completely changed my life for the best. It gave me tools to deal with frustrations and difficulties, and I'm grateful even for the simple fact that it made me think about how I behave, ways I could improve myself to make my life and my loved ones better.

"""In the void is Virtue, and no evil""_Miyamoto Musashi","I've long felt that there were alot of similarities between Miyamoto Musashi's Infinite Success and Marcus Aurelius' Meditations. Maybe it's because of ""take up the attitude of the sun"" and ""to watch the courses of the stars as if you revolved with them"". Lines that standout for me in both books and to me appear to be talking about the exact same thing in the exact same way. Musashi while talking about the void in that book says ""..it is where there is nothing...it is not contained in man's knowledge."" I guess i feel like the body of knowledge of Stoicism is incomplete (I wouldn't know, I haven't read every Stoic text ever written)because of the absence of sages among us everyday. But someone wrote a comment on  here sometime that made me think Stoic Sages are all around us, but we would never know they are here because they are doing their job well.(Like the Oracle when she tells Neo, that there are programs running all over the place, programs to control the sun, the wind, and that the one's doing what they were meant to do, we would never know they are were here). To get to the void Musashi writes that ""..polish the two fold spirit heart and mind"", for which Stoicism as I've come to know it is the best substance for that. And to ""..sharpen the twofold gaze perception and sight"", which to me means understanding the origin of my mother tongue(Luganda). Origin as in which visual element in nature is associated with which sound in my mother tongue, and why.",Stoicism,1701539637.0,t3_18993g0,0.89,15
Detachment vs effort,"I'm making my way though Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus and reading a lot about the detachment from things we can't control. To me it sounds really similar to themes in Christianity and Buddhism and I really appreciate it and think this is a great way to live through adversity.

My quandary and the issue I have in applying it to my life has to do with the disconnect between detachment and creative effort. Despite being content with anything, stoics, I assume, still strive for things other than contentment? There is an imperative to ""live in accordance with nature/reason/God."" There is (even though the texts don't talk about it frequently) positive things we ought to do? Say I'm a husband and father (I am). Isn't it in keeping with stoicism that I provide for my family? Let's say I'm struggling to do that. I think the common stoic advice is to focus on the effort that I apply in this regard and accept that ultimately success is outside of my control. The idea is that I control my actions and not my situation.

The problem with that is it's only true in philosophy world. You absolutely DO have control over your success even if that control is partial and success can't be guaranteed. We are intelligent creatures and opportunities for creative solutions to our problems abound. The world is full of stories of people who thought their way out of difficult situations. Ok, but the stoics do say you can make the attempt so what's the issue? 

The issue is that trying to try isn't trying. One can only fully engage in difficult creative problem solving if they believe that the solution is within their control and they are attached to the outcome. No Olympic winner was just trying to try his best. They were trying to win. The investment in the outcome is necessary for the effort. I know from personal experience how much less likely I am to solve a technical problem I encounter if I think it might not have a solution. This is the opposite of the stoic advice which emphasizes acceptance of fate.

Does Stoicism Accept Suicide?,"Julius Caesar ended him. George Washington wanted to be like him.

Cato The Younger, the most Stoic of the Stoics, decided to die instead of living under a dictator.

But was his death against Stoicism's main idea?

Cato, when he realized Julius Caesar was going to win the war and become the sole ruler of Rome, went to his room.

There, with the noises of fighting men and death clouding his ears, he sat down to read some Plato.

Soon after, the time had come.

Cato took his sword and stabbed himself in the stomach deep enough to feel it, but not deep enough to kill him.

When his son and some of his soldiers entered the room, they found Cato hurt and bloody but not dead.

So they did what any good son and ally would do: they tried to save him.

But then, Cato did the unthinkable.

He was so committed to his cause, or so blinded and confused (I'll get to that in a second), that he disemboweled himself.

In plain English, Cato used his hands to take out his own guts and ensure certain death.

Not only is this a horrific way to die, but it also raises big questions.

Sure, I'm with Cato: this needs balls. To stand against a dictator and show your opposition with works, not words.

But why doesn't anyone comment on the fact that Cato went against Stoicism's most important idea: The Dichotomy of Control?

The fact that Julius Caesar was going (he didn't) to become Rome's ruler was out of Cato's or anyone's control.

Shouldn't Cato, as a Stoic, have accepted this course of events and done the best with what was given to him?

Of course, this brings new questions:

1. What if Caesar killed him? From historical references, Cato and Caesar did no hate each other. But I get that Cato would prefer to die out of his own hands.
2. The Stoics, and Cato as well, viewed life and death as indifferent. So they were fine with one ending one's life, only if the situation demanded it (sacrifice for the common good) or if their life was unbearable.

Ended this workweek on a bad note - need advice on how to approach,"I have a quite demanding job which requires a certain degree of attention to detail and to be able to perform under pressure. I, unfortunetaly, have a less than desirable memory and periodically problems with my concentration; this leads sometimes to sloppy mistakes. I do however my best to avoid this and correct any mistakes I make. 

I have had a good workweek so far, having flow. However, this friday was quite hectic as I had many important reports and documents to write and submit.

It's just embarrassing, because they were annoyed by this mistake and pointed it out in a tartly phrased email. 

I have tried to look it at like this: we all make mistakes, it's all about how we handle them and try to avoid them in future. Is this the correct approach? I'm questioning my entire value as an employee and feel as if I'm just not cut out for a position like this. ",Stoicism,1701450961.0,t3_188h4gx,0.86,5

Confused about stoic view of love.,"I understand the logic behind how stoics say we should treat and view our relationships with our loved ones, as they are obviously not ours to possess and they can be taken away by circumstances, death or by their own choice. However, I still have a bit of a bone to pick with this attitude, as to my eyes it makes light of and minimizes the value of personal connections. If I am not attached to my brother or my child and they die, and I am not shaken or disturbed by their loss due to my lack of attachment, then did I truly love them? To me it seems like the pain of losing a loved one (whether to death, distance, a breakup, etc.) is not a bug or a problem of being too attached or possessive, but rather a simple proof of your love and value they had in your life. 

In short, if you aren't devastated at the loss of your child, did you really love them as a parent should love their child? If you lose something you value and it doesn't hurt, did you really value the thing you lost?",Stoicism,1701446105.0,t3_188f88g,0.93,13

Advice On Moving Out and Possibly Coming Out to Religious Family,"Hi there, I'm a 21 Y.O. male from the UK, and would like some advice when it comes to moving out from my family home and living independently.

I'm in a bit of a tough situation, as my parents and family are aware of my apathetic attitude towards Islam. They know that they'll have to continually force me to wake up for morning prayer, they know that most of my friends are non-Muslim and they know that me moving out could only mean that I'm looking to distance myself from them and the religion.

I know many others who've managed to gain independence once they've moved out for university, but since I've been working from home ever since I left high-school at 18, I've never been able to use the excuse that I'm looking to move out for work related reasons. They'll only accept me moving out once I've found a wife.

This is why I feel forced to come out to them and tell them that I'm no longer a Muslim, for the sake of my own sanity. I'm not sure what the best approach is when it comes to telling them I'm moving out, or that I'm no longer a practicing Muslim. I've accepted that my family would most likely disown me, but I find it hard not to feel responsible for the pain that I'm causing them.   


What is my duty to them as a son? And how should I navigate this situation?

Im not clear on how to articulate my thoughts on this subject: I check this sub from time to time and what i find are in a lot of cases are questions that should be a simple answer: seek professional help. 

Correct me if im wrong but stoicism is a way to think about the world and your place in it. What it is not is a  sound system for dealing with the complex emotions of depression, thoughts of suicide or any other extreme mental health issues. 

My belief has always been that the people who struggle with stoic behaviors and or beliefs are not fit for stoicism. Again correct me if im wrong.

Meditations 5.5 for me is the definition of stoicism in a nutshell.,"“Thou sayest, Men cannot admire the sharpness of thy wits—Be it so: but there are many other things of which thou canst not say, I am not formed for them by nature. Show those qualities then which are altogether in thy power, sincerity, gravity, endurance of labour, aversion to pleasure, contentment with thy portion and with few things, benevolence, frankness, no love of superfluity, freedom from trifling, magnanimity. Dost thou not see how many qualities thou art immediately able to exhibit, in which there is no excuse of natural incapacity and unfitness, and yet thou still remainest voluntarily below the mark? or art thou compelled through being defectively furnished by nature to murmur, and to be stingy, and to flatter, and to find fault with thy poor body, and to try to please men, and to make great display, and to be so restless in thy mind? No by the gods: but thou mightest have been delivered from these things long ago. Only if in truth thou canst be charged with being rather slow and dull of comprehension, thou must exert thyself about this also, not neglecting it nor yet taking pleasure in thy dulness.”


It says that if we don’t have s desirable trait by nature alone that it’s in our power to gain it by dedication 

I want to be a kind and smart man, I’m kind by nature but not very smart (it’s obvious that a lot of factors come into play that Marcus Aurelius couldn’t have understood back then, such as in my case where I’m a neurodivergent person but that doesn’t mean that I can’t strive to learn more with a combination of meditation, therapy and discipline of study) 

The quote emphasises subjects of dedication, control of pleasure, acceptance of one’s luck (or the idea of fortuna), benevolence, etc 

It teaches us to not blame external factors and that the talent can be surpassed if the dedication overcomes the talent, as someone who have always compared myself with my peers and always thought that (i’m slow and there’s nothing that I can do to change it) this quote hit me like a brick to the head",Stoicism,1705261004.0,t3_196o3kq,0.88,12

I saw a post here a short while ago about how Marcus Aurelius fed people to animals, and what that says about the credibility of his Meditations.

Also, I try to praise loudly and criticize quietly, but I Still critize, blame people when I don't get what i want from them, especially if they've been reliable in the past. It's the inconsistency of people that gets to me alittle, because even though I am not perfect in my interactions with people, I prioritize being consistent(although it's out of my hands how people perceive my consistency.) So whenever i catch myself mentally blaming someone, I lean into it, but I ""level"" myself by adding to that mentally placating the person, or adding to that the mental equivalent of being physiologically distracted. Non of these is exactly in Stoicism(because non of those involves being super logical), but they are in a form of therapy I've found useful.

What is the view of depression in stoicism,"I was introduced to stoicism by this greek doctor that I worked with two years ago and suffice to say some of the principles had helped me through some dark times in my life. 

I am curious to see the perspective of a stoic in terms of depression. I constantly get a sudden attack of extreme sadness with or without trigger which manifests in physical tiredness (too tired to move even a little) 

I think the scary thing about depression is how real you think what lies/uncertainty/assumption/conclusion your mind tells you. 

Like many others struggling the same, I get tired too, tried many things but to no avail. 

I have accepted that there is no guarantee that I will get better and vice versa. 

Do I just accept that my life is surrounded by mostly sadness?  And how do I achieve that?",Stoicism,1705157618.0,t3_195poga,0.58,2
I dont know how to stop chasing and still make friends... i want to stop being desperate and needy stop people pleasing and stop chasing.,"This thought is back again... i see some guy texting and smiling and making her happy and i think ""i cant do that"" i cant talk for hours and its always me chasing and starting conversations then i think that no girl likes me, then the thought of no one loves me or cares about me. And no one is into me, its like that thought disgusts them... i dont even want a Gf, just be friends with girls because i have none. 

I dont do this anymore but i used to text a girl and try to prove to my self that im not unlikeable or loveable and always would backfire.

And i dont even know what to talk about, be interested in her? I become interested but they arent interested, because i always text first, I dont know how to have conversations for a long time... or talk about everything, i suck at talking

They mostly reply with one words, i know i shouldn't base my self worth on girls, and should base it on inner happiness. And im trying to focus less on girls and focus on self growth and stop chasing girls.. and try to build meaningful connections instead of chasing.",Stoicism,1705160897.0,t3_195qvb8,0.56,1
[DISCUSSION] Investigating Anger is the answer,"Good morning Stoa, a few days ago I came here after I had an *incident*. I got angry and lost my temper.

It was very uncool of me, and that lead to a lot of introspection, analysis, reflections, writing, and research.  

Not only I have come to the realization that I was wrong, but that I have been wrong all my life.

I had the wrong belief systems and worldviews, which rendered my analysis of the situations faulty.

Regardless that I was wronged, I had no business at getting angry, let alone losing my temper. That is never the answer to anything. I had faulty belief systems.

I have reframed my thinking and my belief systems, thanks in partly to Stoicism.

Today I am a better man, I still have work to do to better myself, and I know that the episode was a tilting point in my life.

I thank this sub for providing me with great comments and continuing to provide a source of sanity.

Keep up the good work.",Stoicism,1705080756.0,t3_1950oih,0.89,35

Feeling the weight of time: Struggling to find my path in mid20s,"




I didn't work the entire 2023 year and I don't even have any health insurance. The only thing I did was trying to complete classes for college. But I even missed two semesters because of personal problems and stuff. I'm also feeling lost in life despite being in mid-20s. I just can't seem to find my path in life like career wise. I feel like I'm too old for college especially going in university because it seems like time consuming and finically expensive. I'm currently in community college and they do offer various certification programs and even two year degree programs but I'm not not sure what to get into as Im worrying like stuff about Ai expanding then bunch of layoffs happened. I want to get in a career that will help in long run and be substantial. I'm just stuck in this rut for about a year and even this new year hasn't been to a great start. I just can't afford myself sitting at home doing nothing. I'm just allowing my mind and thoughts control me. I'm tired of this anxiety and fear. Not having understand of life makes me feel weak and overwhelmed. I'm lacking confidence I guess and I'm just trying to find my way out. I previously so far only have fast food and retail experience but because I'm not driving, I'm kinda in a tight spot like transportation is issue in my area so I even applied to remote jobs but obviously I have hard time finding too sighs. So I'm just in completely messed up spot in life right now. Don't understand what to pick and choose or what to do first or something. I even worry like the world is changing so fast and it's important to learn essential life skills like doing your taxes, understanding how the economy works and the direction it's going.

How Do I transcend My Own Suffering?,"I recently started reading a psychiatry book, titled The Haunted Self, which is primarily focus on trauma diagnosis and recovery. I learned that trauma can shatter your very essence in a proportional amount to the severity and frequency of the trauma. Don't get me wrong I understand that suffering is a fact of life, and therefore, cannot be avoided. Additionally, suffering can teach us valuable lessons and propel us forward if harnessed and put to good use. Nevertheless, I still can't wrap my head around the fact that there are no lessons to learn from, for instance, having a family full of psychopaths, murderers, rapists and pedophiles. From the stoic point of view, how am I supposed to transcend pain when it was inflicted for sadistic pleasure repeatedly for a decade of my so-called childhood? How can I transcend the pain of never knowing what mother love is? How can I transcend the pain of losing everyone I care about?

I like the notion in Stoicism that moral virtue should be at the top of everyone's priorities. In fact, I lost everything and nearly lost my life because virtue matters the most to me, and if I get a re-do I won't change a thing. I guess my problem is that I don't understand how to resolve 'pointless pain' that offers no lessons, but still haunts me to this day.

"""What should be done?"" My thoughts on this","Since I was little I've always been very inspired by history, and I've always wanted to 'make a difference', I guess is a good way of putting it. In short, I wanted to no longer be an NPC in the world, and today I see that things are a little more complicated, I think today I understand that this is something that we all try to do, and that perhaps this is what makes us part of the whole , we all want to be different and that's something that makes us equal, I think. Anyway, I always had this desire to find something that would make me do something for the world, not caring about fame or anything like that, but just to know that I contributed a little to the future of humanity, something like Newton's contributions to Physics, a subject that I have always loved. A little because of this, I decided to start a physics course at university, with the childhood dream that it would be easy to achieve something of this magnitude, but then I was faced with the fact that maybe I didn't like physics that much to dedicate myself to it. an entire life. I mean, the more time passes, the more I realize that I'm not an academic. I love physics, but I also love many other things that take up my time and that I consider just as important. It's as if the side of me that wants to do something for the world conflicts with the side of me that just seeks my happiness. On the one hand, I fear spending my whole life searching in vain, and in the end realizing that I wasted my chances of enjoying everything I could. And on the other side, I fear reaching the end of my life, taking advantage of every opportunity to be happy, but having to carry the burden of feeling like I haven't achieved anything, of not having left anything useful behind, as if my existence as a human asked me to do something. Currently the answer I have to this dilemma is that, no one who really changed the world had the objective of 'changing the world', they had an insatiable passion for something, and leaving a legacy of that was just a consequence of that passion. It's like an eternal doubt, I want to fulfill a duty and not be selfish, at the same time that I can't say there is something, a passion, that makes me focus on it that much, because I love many things.

&#x200B;

Forgive me for this huge text hehe. I know I'm still young and immature, so forgive me too if I wrote something clearly absurd (Also if this has nothing to do with stoicism, I'm still new), but that's how I feel. These existential questions have always plagued me, but I like to think, I like to think about them and any work that delves into this type of thing. A work that I can use to draw a parallel about how I feel is the work of fiction and fantasy Fate Stay Night, more specifically the character Emiya Shirou. In short, and spoilers ahead, the game has 3 routes in which Shirou makes different decisions. In one of them, he decides to become a hero of justice, even though he knows all the bitterness that this path would bring, and the story really deals with that, it is a complete break with that hero stereotype, but Shirou still chooses to be, which I think it's very pretty. In another route, however, he decides to be the hero of just one person, Sakura, the girl he loves. In one route he decides to embrace his childish ideals in the name of a greater good, and in another he decides to embrace his own happiness. In both cases he decides to embrace this passion, and I feel exactly in the middle of it, remembering that it is just a parallel. Trying to be a 'normal' person or trying to be something more. I see possible regrets in both of them. I know there's no right answer, but I think I wanted to vent a little about this, and I wanted to know if you guys had any thoughts on this. It's something that scares me a little hehe, but I like to think about it",Stoicism,1705115413.0,t3_195dz3r,0.43,0
Basic knowledge of philosophy,"Morning/Evening all depending on where you are in the world. 

I’m new to stoicism and so far am very much enjoying trying to apply its teaching to my life. However I have no real understanding of philosophy in general and feel as though some of the OG stoic material is lost of me because of this. 

Do I need to first explore philosophical concepts such as ‘metaphysics', ‘nature’ and all that before I can truly understand the words of Epictetus and Marcus?

How should you actually read Meditations?,"So long story short...I've been an admirer and reader of the Stoics, particularly Marcus Aurelius, for years. What I'm trying to do is to practice the virtues sufficiently that they become habit and second-nature to me - something that probably will take years if not decades to accomplish. It's a really difficult task and I've messed up (pretty badly) on multiple occasions.

And so I often ask myself the question ""How did \[insert Stoic\] do it?"" At least for Marcus Aurelius it seems part of the answer was keeping himself accountable with his personal journal - what we read as Meditations today. And Meditations is a beautiful book, just...I've found it really hard to read. The problem might be the version, I'm using the Hicks version, but it's always seemed like a collection impossibly difficult maxims that I could appreciate in a moment of serenity but not in a moment of crisis.

Is the problem the version I'm using? Am I studying Meditations wrong? Is it just my fault for being slow-witted? Any advice would be much appreciated.

Struggling to connect with others - feel like I am repeating the same thing over and over again.,"Life seems to be a constant struggle. I feel like I am running around in circles, infinitely so. 

I have struggled with depression for a long time (and I also have Aspergers). My depression is kind of situational. If I have friends, work and things to do, it doesn’t emerge. But when I don’t, life doesn’t feel worth living. I take mediciation for it (and therapy) which has helped immensely, but I can’t help but think that I seem to be stuck in this cycle that I cannot seem to break out of. 

My depression led to me dropping out of high school. Despite this, I worked my ass off at home and made it to one of the best colleges in the country.

While I find it easy to make 1:1 connections with others,  I never seem to connect with groups or make a solid circle of friends. The 1:1 friendships I have are often really intense but for one reason or another they die out. And for really inexplicable reasons. Sometimes they will go back home, then when college starts they suddenly don’t want to talk much or hang out anymore. I don’t get it.

I graduated college with great academics but not much to show for it in the way of friendships. For career reasons, I decided to do a masters program at again one of the best colleges. But I seem to be struggling with the same problem. I can have great conversations with a lot of people. But I don’t have a group. And sometimes I’ll arrange things with people, but people have yet to invite me to anything, except for birthday parties. I want to be hanging out with people, going out, having a good time. Yet I seem to be alone on Friday night, again, while everyone else is doing exactly that. 

I can’t seem to break this cycle I seem to be stuck in. I think my Aspergers may be a part of why I can’t connect in the same way that others do, but I can’t seem to figure out what I’m doing wrong, even with therapy. I don’t know how much more of this I can take.",Stoicism,1705092228.0,t3_19559zv,0.5,0

Help,"I got into stoicism last year after reading a book called: the little book of stoicism.

I’m 24 years old, neurodivergent, queer (and last year found out that I’m trans, something that my bigoted parents are surely going to love), I have been battling depression for more than 10 years, have binge eating disorder, social anxiety and generally feel like an outsider and that I’m wasting my life 

I live in Brazil and everything here is so loud and confusing and every day I need to deal with a bunch of Ignorant people 

I’m just tired, I’m almost a quarter of a century old and I’ve wasted my life up to this point,  I have no personal achievements, no driving license (I failed the exam), no romantic relationship (although I don’t really care about that just think that it would be nice), no discipline and don’t know how to have it 

Im going to finish college this year and I didn’t even picked what I wanted to graduate, my mom chose that I was gonna be a dentist behind my back without consulting me, and I really don’t want to be a dentist 

I’ve had my ups and downs during those years but they were mostly bad, I’ve cried for no reason during most of my days, have contemplated suicide in a lot of occasions and I’m generally just screaming in my mind “I WANT TO DIE WHAT AM I DOING HERE ?!?!” while looking calm on the outside

I’ve been practicing stoicism lately and I do like the ideas and lessons but I’m still fairly new to it and feel like it’s a bit utopian to me",Stoicism,1704986581.0,t3_19446pw,0.4,0

"How Stoicism Helped Me Throughout the Years, Despite Key Misunderstandings","*I hope this little tale can serve as inspiration for those of you interested in Stoicism only as a shield and less so as a toolbox. A*s it turned out for me, it provided and even more powerful operating system.

&#x200B;

I first stumbled upon Stoicism in 2012 as a graduate. I read ""Letters from a Stoic"" as I imagine newly converted Christians read the Bible; quite literally and with great joy and fulfillment.

At the time, I was a young man who had listened to everything from Dan Pena, Joe Dispenza, and to some extent Tony Robbins, even though he always seemed too ""guru-ish"" for me to really believe in. Stoicism provided me with the operating system I needed at the time.

However, I mistook being stoic for not letting emotions get to me. This served me very well for years. I overcame one challenge after another, climbed the corporate ladder quickly, and moved all over Europe in search of additional personal and professional growth. By many metrics, I was a young successful man with everything ahead of me.

One day, I realized my current job and life situation were no longer challenging. Despite making good money, living in a safe and affluent city, and earning a decent amount while traveling often, I was bored. I needed action. So, I took the leap, leaving that job for another and moving once again to a different city in Europe.

It was shortly after making the decision to move again that I realized much of my boredom and lack of growth where I was actually had very little to do with my surroundings, and everything to do with myself. By, in a Stoic manner, turning off most of my emotions, both the highs and lows of my intense life felt bland.

Shortly after, I returned to Stoicism and this forum. I realized that Stoicism is really about accepting feelings and then ""applying"" Stoicism, instead of using it as a mental filter to mute feelings and numb sensations. At one point, I was afraid that this new approach would make me lose one of my strongest abilities in life: to endure hardship.

But, as it turns out, this new way of interpreting Stoicism, for me, provided an even more powerful operating system to tackle everyday life. I learned how to accept feelings, embrace them, and power through. The acceptance step became crucial, as it helped me feel pain, enabling fruitful reflection and therefore progress.

I hope this little tale can serve as inspiration for those of you interested in Stoicism only as a shield and less so as a toolbox. If possible, try to repeat my misstake :)",Stoicism,1704895967.0,t3_19396dw,0.87,11

Help with list of Stoic quotes,"One of the things I lament about so-called ""Stoic quotes"" online is that they rarely, if ever, include the source. As I find myself presently in the midst of a project that requires me to gather roughly 50 brief Stoic quotes, the process of falsifying them as having actually come from who they say they come from is proving quite tedious. 

Many of them are poorly paraphrased so it could take me an hour or two to find out where they came from and, by the time I do, they might not even carry the same meaning as the malformed quote did. 

If you have the time and inclination, dropping one or two of your favorite quotes (with sources) in this thread would be helpful... if not to me specifically, as I might not find your quote specifically applicable to what I'm working on, to anyone looking for a trustworthy repository of Stoic quotes with sources!

The Jean Valjean problem. Does stoicism indeed say he should not steal bread?,"Wanted to raise this question after listening to a discussion on a podcast. I am having some issues with it, so I'm coining the phrase the Jean Valjean problem  


In Les Miserables, Jean Valjean steals bread and is cast into prison for it. He eventually escapes and becomes a better person. 


The problem for stoicism as I understand it is the theft part. I may not understand stoicism correctly here,  but I believe that since stoics state virtue is the highest goal, and that our own life is less important than this, stealing a loaf of bread to survive (assuming for the sake of argument it is a life and death situation,  no escaping the thought experiment by claiming another option like borrowing money to buy bread) is considered less virtuous than not stealing and succumbing to death. 


I am not sure if this is a correct interpretation,  but I cannot agree with it for 2 eeasons:


1) Life isn't worthless. The value of continuing life at the expense of stolen bread is worth it. The value of a life is more than a loaf of bread so even though theft is not virtuous, it is excusable in this situation. 


2) life is worthwhile specifically because permitting a life to continue,  even at the expense of virtue, means that the person can grow and become virtuous over time. They cannot do that if they are dead.

Seeking comfort after dog’s loss,"My childhood dog, best friend and only company has passed away after fighting tumours for last 4 months. I am 22. Yesterday was supposed to be a regular veterinary visit and schedule to remove one tumour. He was 12, turned it just 1 month ago and was a golden retriever. He had multiple tumours which were operated and taken out, but one kept coming for the third time. It was his 4th operation in 4 months. Last days he was not eating and drinking that much as his tumour was in his mouth and was bleeding and hurting him. He went to the car so happy, full of life. I knew that it would take him but not that quick. Vet took him to immediate operation as his tumour started bleeding heavily, and we were told to pick him up in few hours. Upon arriving, the vet said he removed it and that he is slowly waking up but still bleeding so he advises to leave him overnight. At 9PM we got a call that he passed away after failed reanimation. My world broke.

We didn’t properly said goodbye. I can’t believe that the last picture of him is from yesterday shortly before leaving. My family is broken too. What hurts me is that he died without us, after promising him that we will pick him up as usual. Last night was tough, barely slept at all. I am on and off from stoicism in last year, but I know core concepts and it helped me a little. We are to bury him tomorrow as we have to pick him up today.

how do I attain happiness in my routine and life?," I've recently reflected on what had brought me joy in the past, the current moment and also could in the future. This is a copy of my thoughts, and I'd love to hear other people's thoghts on it :)

so, how do I attain happiness in my daily routine and life? 

Everyone want to be happy, and there are different ways for people to achieve that, each person has their own way that they persue. Taking my mates for example, at least what I see on the outside, they occasionally go out to parties, get high and drink, eat junk food and those are usually their highlights of the day. 

But that's not what I truely enjoy doing. Literally today, had my first pizza in probably three years, and it was seriously pretty bad. The taste was actually aweful. I felt nauseous afterwards, and regardless if I had a group involvement in my class I would prefer to pick a different, more nutricous meal for lunchtime. Thinking back to when I had a streak of a couple of days of being active, excercising and eating enough nutricous food, I literally get a sense of freedom, acomplishment and expecially peace.  

This was one of the things that brings me back to my question: How do I find happiness and purpose? Since it doesn't seem like a reasonable option to have a completely concrete step-by-step plan to be happy, since things change and you need to adapt, but I am aware many perspectives, healthy and unhealthy, picking the option for delayed or instant gradification, and in the long run it's always better to opt for the delayed, healthy option. Just recently I've watched a video, it's blantly obvious but the things that you are doing now are not effecting you right now, but rather the things you did years, months, days prior do. And in reverse your future depends on what you literally do at the current moment.  

So how do I attain happiness in my routine and in life?  

I need to find a balance between work and life.  

Currently I need to get education going and persue the path of excellence in academics. Afterwards I will be able to have a job that is high paying, so I can do whatever I want, not be constrained by a lack of rescources. Of course not to forget that for long term happiness it's highly important to pick a job that you actually enjoy doing, possibly using the method of ikagai, and also considering your established type of intelligence that you were born with (reference from a podcast that robert freene was on and mentioned that matter in his book mastery, the types are: linguistic, logical-mathematical, inter/-arpersonal, naturalistic, musical, kinesthetic and spacial intelligence; source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/harvard-psychologist-types-of-intelligence-where-do-you-score-highest-in.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/harvard-psychologist-types-of-intelligence-where-do-you-score-highest-in.html) ) Additionally, reflecting on the chliche suggestion that you should be enjoying your teen years while you can (go out and party, get drunk, high, not care about what you fuel your body with, when you sleep, etc.) I personally don't consider that view of ""enjoying your young teens"" as true enjoyment.  

In the moment in which I reach the top of a mountain after a high hike, having delicous dinner after a long day, waking up for a tasty breakfast, the morning sky, the sunset, the sun rise, the colors that the sky can take during different hours of the day, the way clouds move though out atmosphere, the acomplishment when you start comprehending an interesting topic, having deeptalk with a friend, the butterflies that you suddenly get when seeing a certain someonehaving music literally run through your veins when inducing it or just listening; the flow when reading an incaptivating book, the adrenaline kick when doing some crazy activity, sights of cities, landmarks, nature, different cultures, architecture, languages, customs, fashion or just calm walks acompanied by your close ones or just just yourself; there are endless opportunities that are here to be discovered, literally endless.  

Drifting back to reality, above I've listed multiple examples of things, that some far have brought sincere joy to my life and contributed to my life's purpose. Ejoying existing while growing for the betterment of myself and humanity. Obviously those moments cannot, at the time that I'm writing this down, happen on a daily basis. Right now I am given the opportunity, all ressources necessary, to educate myself, get a job and open the door for many more occassions which will bring me joy. 

It's absolutely obligatory for me not to let into brainfog, to start neglecting my health and being able to enjoy the simplicity and beauty of raw nature due to my dopanime receptors (and just my physical and mental condition) be fried to the brim of exctintion. Not let myself forget the hidden dangers of instant gradification and get in a hellish loop that day by day would bring me closer to depression, anxiety, shame and even death.  

So how do I balance my work and free time in a sustainable, meaningful way? 

It is of significance to consider that laying out an unrealistic schedule of a self-improvement type of guru is not going to be beneficial because of multiple reasons. The motive of it isn't really wrong, but the execution is usually not backed by scientific proof, and a sense of purpose. Why do so many people fail their new years resulution? Quiet frankly, they are not thinking about both long and short term dradification. There needs to be a balanced amount of both, else (at least that's what it's been like for me) it's not maintainable. It's so simple to skip going to the gym and  just have that last junky snack, because it's so much easier to do so. Instead just show up to the gym, don't obligate yourself to do a full on three hour workout, seriously just show up and do the bare minimun. Only thrity minutes is totally enough. If you've done, and keep picking this option consistenly, then you can do whatever would please you afterwards. Usually when you've already brought yourself to start, show up for that half an hour, is what it needs to get the stone rolling for a more productive way of living. You will get endorphines by doing the sport, a happy hormone, and the meal after excersising always tastes better if youre slightly worn out.  

And if you consistenly repeat an effective, maintainable routine, you will eventually reach a point where you can do whatever, whenever, with the people you love. That doesn't mean you can't do those things in the process of getting there, it is of most significace that you incooperate enough healthy happiness boosting activities into your routine in order to be able to sustain the discipline. Because in words it's easier written than done, actually do the due paper, decline unhealthy habits, but it can be done. You need to reward youself with ""natural"" induced gradification (note: look these methods up, backed up science based evidence), self reflection, self awareness and a sense of purpose.  

It's impossible to summarrise how to have a sense of purpose briefly, but the main point is that every person has their own, evolving purpose/reason to live for. Since the world is evoling and so many things are out of my control, I rather focus on the things that are in my power, like picking to go on a peaceful walk, enjoy a couple minutes of chilling with my loving cat, etc, that give me some direction of purpose.

"What are your views on ""48 Laws of Power"" by Robert Greene?","Lately, I started reading the title and after reading a couple of chapters, I found the ideas contrasting to the fundamentals of a stoic approach to life ( Temperance, Courage, Justice and Wisdom). 
Being Stoic in its true essence is not completely being emotionless, rather controlling the extreme emotional turmoils while replacing the negative sides with compassion and understanding .

Should i care about what other people think of me?,"I'm getting into stoicism but im really lost, im currently reading multiple books one of them being the discourses by epictetus. and i know that other people opinions are externals i can not control their opinions.

So i think i shouldn't care about their opinions, but i saw a post asking the same question i am now asking, and people said you should care.

Come to think of it someone who doesnt care what other people think of him wont be nice tl sit around, someone who only care about himself and his opinion is stupid, cause criticism are ehat build us and make us better when to know you should maybe improve your health sometimes you're of the opinion that your is great, but maybe someone says your health is bad and you're fat should i just ignore him cause he is external then?

I know my explanation is bad but english is my second language and stoicism seem something so deep and im but young and foolish guy I'm 18.

I am going through incredible pressure from my surroundings and the feeling of being stabbed in the back.," 

About a year ago, I started a project with a few friends at that time. We were just a branch of a larger project that someone initiated in the capital city. The completion of that project was supposed to bring benefits to all of us. Hoping for a positive outcome, I handed over complete control to my friend at that time. We went through a tough period together, working hard and under a lot of stress. I lost 5kg due to anxiety, and it also cost me a lot of money. The project was completed a few months ago. The people in charge in the capital city are now working and reaping the benefits. I waited for them to call me and offer something, a job or a way to earn money, because we went through all of that together. However, they never contacted me. Now I find out that all this time, they were communicating with my friend who was the coordinator for my area, but he pushed me aside and is collecting benefits for his closest circle of people and family. I am practically excluded from the story even though I did everything that everyone else did, even more. My family and friends ask me every day when something will come out of it, when I can expect something. Some people even have expectations that I can help them, even though I can't help myself. It's very difficult to be deceived and betrayed, especially in a small town. I don't know what to do; I don't have contact with people from the capital city. Also, I wouldn't want to confront my 'friend' because maybe something will come from him. Please advise me because I can't sleep at night, and I can't bear to see my sad parents because I was deceived in some way.""

Finding gratitude can be so difficult,"Gratitude can be so hard to find for my personality type. I’m a perfectionist, idealist, and can be vain and superficial.

It can be really easy for me to focus on the negative. Get angry/pitiful at myself, life, fate. And easy to look around me and wonder why I have to deal with issues that all these others don’t (of course they’re likely dealing with their own problems).

I’ve been quite depressed before and still struggle with bouts of anxiety, sadness. Objectively speaking, I’ve been blessed in many ways. But I think it’s easy to take things for granted. I mean in life an infinite amount of things could go wrong at anytime. Everything is truly fragile, and thinking about that, helps me gain some gratitude for all that I have, and all that hasn’t gone wrong.",Stoicism,1704701874.0,t3_191gbrg,0.8,8

i am new here and i wanted to ask how can i cope with the thoughts in my head. When something i am looking forward to or something important takes place on the next day i cant't stop thinking about if i can sleep tonight or not. The problem is that something in my mind says you have to sleep know or else something physically will happen to you tomorrow like a heart attack or epilepsy. I had to struggle with anxiety for a long time also anxiety of dying so thats not new to me. I take sleep to seriously and cant fall asleep because i stress myself about sleeping.

Is there a contradiction between stoicism and modern psychology about control of emotions ?,"If I understand well, to simplify stoicism tells us to control emotions

"The Jedi code sounds like it was written by a stoic, and the Sith code a hedonist.","*There is no emotion, there is peace*.  

*There is no ignorance, there is knowledge.*  

*There is no passion, there is serenity.*  

*There is no chaos, there is harmony.*  

*There is no death, there is the Force.*  

The first line I’m not sure I completely agree with. There are things like rational joy, but in a broader sense I think stoics would at least agree in part. Emotions are contrived from our judgments, which are a construct. Inner peace though is a common stoic theme, and is the result of sound judgment, not false beliefs assented into emotion.

The second line reminds me of a theme in stoicism that the true stoic sage is never upset, because he only has knowledge. Socrates famously said “the only sin is ignorance”.  

The third line is another stoic tenant. Marcus Aurelius talks in the meditations often about avoiding passions as they can take away from your rationality and sound judgment. A good sound judgment and an understanding of nature, will result in a natural sense of serenity and joy.  

The fourth line is again, often brought up in stoicism. I interpret chaos here as “unnatural”. Everything is natural, therefore nothing can be unnatural or chaotic. Chaos is a perception. A vicious storm isn’t chaotic, it’s just a storm. A result of nature that brings harmony and balance.  

And finally the last line. I’m not precisely sure what metaphor is meant by *there is no death*, as there is of course death. Maybe they meant you ought not to fear death. Maybe they meant you never really die because you’re resorbed back into the force. And the force could be interpreted in stoic physics as *the logos* as the ancient philosophers say.  

With all that dissected here is the sith code by contrast. You can make your own interpretations, but I think it’s clear why this doctrine is adopted by “the baddies” in the Star Wars universe. It clearly leads to a troubled, never satisfied, self destructive, vice consuming soul.  

*Peace is a lie. There is only Passion.*  

*Through Passion, I gain Strength.*  

*Through Strength, I gain Power.*  

*Through Power, I gain Victory.*  

*Through Victory my chains are Broken.*  

*The Force shall free me.*  

I’ve seen people unironically get the sith code tattooed on themselves. It sounds hype on surface level but upon further inspection, it’s troubling.",Stoicism,1704651506.0,t3_190yh7d,0.74,19
For new Stoics...,"With the popularity of Stoicism, like from Ryan Holiday and Massimo Pigliucci. People new to Stoicism should learn that they are referred to as Modern Stoics, which is a secular part of Traditional Stoicism. They leave out the most important part of Traditional Stoicism, Providence, and living according to Nature. If you read Marcus, Seneca, and Epictetus, Nature is foundational and is the only way Stoicism truly works to reach eudaimonia or happiness. If you are serious about Stoicism, learn how the Stoics viewed everything from a cosmic standpoint. Without it's not true Tradition Stoicism as the ancients taught, it's a secular form.

Of course, I replied ""I agree 100%"", but it made me think of Stoicism and this sub.

What is the *""Stoic""* answer?

We know that the world runs mostly on emotionally-driven decisions, we see it every day; so is it *silly* to wish otherwise? Should we as Stoics be like Ninjas, not wishing that the world were different, but improvise, adapt, and overcome life's situations as they manifest themselves to us?

How to stop desiring women,"Im a single 31 yr old man, my whole life ive felt alone, sad, and sometimes depressed. My parents were verbally abusive to each other before they seperated after 25 yrs.

How to reconcile Aurelius's murder of Christians with his Stoicism,"So I was telling someone the other day how much I loved Marcus Aurelius, and how much his ""Meditations"" meant to me, and what a cool philosopher he was, et al, and she said ""I used to love him, too.

I'll be honest, I had no idea about this, so I googled it, and she was more or less exactly correct. Now, I understand that the times were the times, and Roman Emperors were not pacifists, and that Christians were seen as sort of a crazy fringe cult at the time.

I come from a muslim family and they don’t know and alot of my fear stems from them finding out and selfishly I stay at home as a dependent and save money and plan to move once I graduate university.

"On Virtue, Asceticism and the Request for Help","Hi everyone

I would like to ask you what exercises you need to do in order to grow in virtue. I read Marcus Aurelius several times, but I abandoned it in favor of the diatribes and the encheiridiona of Epictetus. I also read Cicero, whom I like very much because of his understanding of virtue.

1 Specific question: what do you think about asceticism as a preferential good that purifies all vices from man? Such as laziness, lack of self-discipline, and so on. Of course, this serves as a preliminary stage, for it is known that the man who tilles the soil, has uprooted the weeds, cut the earth, and sows or plants, that is, develops virtues. That's not to say that he hasn't done it before, but that getting rid of the superfluous helps. What do you think? (P.S. I'm a fan of Cynic asceticism)

2  Can virtue be exercised and will it always be present until we neglect it? I'm afraid that virtue is only an exercise of judgments in the mind that we hold onto, and that when they are lacking, it turns out that there is no virtue and never has been? After all, if it turns out that Stoic virtue is just a matter of the mind, I think I'd rather have Cicero's teaching on virtue than the Greek masters.

3  Do you have any internships that you can recommend to me? The reason I'm asking you this is that I'd rather deal with practices than just theoretical scripts on a lot of websites. I believe I can learn a lot from you, so if you would like to share some advice with me, I will be happy to hear it.

Please be patient and understanding, I'm not even sure if I gave the right flair (I'm sorry if I chose the wrong one). I try to learn new things and analyze what I already know, whether what I knew was really right.

Best regards!

Hi Stoics! Lend me your ear a moment please!,"Hey guys. I feel the desire to be very detailed here but I’ll try to keep it short and hopefully not break any rules while I’m at it.

I am 40 years old and I’m about 3 years outside of deconstructing from a lifelong Baptist brainwa… I mean, faith. I had always butted heads with fellow Christians, I always felt like it was all pretty fake and vain, and I was one of those delirious young Christians who thought I had a special connection with God, a certain special empathy for other human beings or something.

Anyways, when I was 35, my left foot started going numb and I figured it was just a pinched nerve in my back. Fast forward 3 years and now the numbness spread to my whole body, and even neurologists at Cleveland Clinic can’t figure it out, and say it has to be something genetic. (This is where I could really ramble, so I’ll stop myself here).

This was the straw that broke the Camel’s back, this is what finally pushed me through deconstruction and take that terrifying leap of ironic faith. I read a few books like Leaving the Fold, Age of Reason, etc. A lot of books on buddhism were also helpful in learning to meditate, but I felt like it was flirting too much with religion.

Then I read Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations, and that was it. Lights out, this dude spoke the language of my very soul. I’m happy to have found Stoicism! My biggest problem is that I am still so very hung up on my anger and resentment towards Yahweh, its so bad that it colors almost all of my thoughts. I still feel like a dictator is lording over everything. I still mentally lash out at him in my darkest times, even though I know I’m screaming at the void.

So, long story short, how do I kick this Jesus habit? Thanks for reading and sorry if I offended anyone. That snarky, passive aggressiveness towards Christianity is THE very thing I’m trying to address.

Edit: I know I could and should post this over in the ex-christian sub, and I’m definitely a lurker over there, but it can be a bit of an echo-chamber in there.",Stoicism,1704557978.0,t3_1903h7a,0.73,5

I am one of the r/niceguys. How do I undo this?,"OK, maybe not really like /r/niceguys, I am happily married, and when I was single I had no problems dating, although casually dating, FWB, ONS.

My ""problems"" manifest mostly at work, friendships and family members.

-----

I am not new to Stoicism, I have read the classics and Pigliucci/Irvine; and I know that Stoicism is not about suppressing one's emotions.

I am posting here because the mods allow *""Seeking Stoic Advice""* posts, and because the comments here are the best quality comments across the entire Reddit ecosystem.

I am an old(er) Redditor and I have come a long way in my life; up until not long ago I thought that my life was pretty great, then the other day I lost my temper, something that had not happened in a very long time, and that I thought it was gone from my personality; but there I was. And it was ugly. I was ugly. Details withheld because they don't matter. Losing one's temper is uncalled for. Period.

But my reflections on what happens has led me to keen observation of my MO(s) and behavior, and I have come to the realization that:

1. I don't perform well in confrontations
2. I don't perform well under stress (stress real or imagined)
3. I play ""nice"" by default, but then turn ugly in situations #1 and #2 above.
4. So really, I am not that ""nice"".

I have read ""No More Mr Nice Guy"", as well as ""Not Nice"" and ""The Disease to Please"".

Dear members of this Stoa, if you are still with me, besides my Stoic practice of reading and re-reading the classics and selective modern Stoic writers (I don't do Ryan H), daily journaling, daily journaling challenging my belief systems, what resources do you have for me to better myself?

I am also looking into my insurance benefits for going to therapy too. I have been in therapy in the past for depression and then declared depression-free (and I believe it).  I know I have some problems with anxiety and, of course, anger; but I do believe that anxiety and anger are related.

Grieving for the lost health,"I've had flu-like symptoms for six months. All kinds of physical effort, like walking or standing, feel horrible. This has led me to grieve for my health. I know every single human loses their health eventually. I had plans. I know everyone will have plans that will be cancelled permanently. What difference does it make if it happens now or in 40 years? If you have seen a day, you have seen them all. And I have experienced life already.
Some things have been harder than before for me lately, but what difference does hard or easy make? Why would an easy life be more valuable for me?
Truth is, I have no way of knowing how long all this will last for me. An even firmer truth is that this is all just the beginning. Losing health, among other things, is inevitable. Not just for me but for all. Why lament the natural state of life?

How to manage stress in gaming (and in general)?,"I'm a young man getting slowly into stoicism. It is like 4th day since i started reading about it more (I'm still in the middle of reading one of William B. Irvine's books, it's my first). I like playin a lot of dynamic, stressful games like e.g. ULTRAKILL. I think im playing rationally - trying some tactics, doing stuff to manage problems (prioritizing enemies, defending yourself etc.). Nontheless tend to feel a lot of stress. At first i was still raging, hitting my desk, but today i felt a bit of a progress - i was still very stressed, i sometimes felt angry, however i remained calm and ""took a deep breath"" and went ahead. It might be also be caused by the fact i'm at my grandma and i don't want to make noise.
This applies to even some activities. In fact, i feel stress rn writing this (dunno why exactly tho). After trying to imply Irvine's suggestions in my daily life i feel better - i usually felt like people want the worst for me and they treat me as someome worse. Nowadays i feel less affected, like i don't care. Only time i felt bad was when my friend called PlayStation 3 gay (yes, he has xbox lmao) as i have huge nostalgia for this console.
What i want to ask in summary - is there a way to calm myself down after a big dose of stress and is it bad for me, as a stoic, to feel stressed in gaming?",Stoicism,1704558937.0,t3_1903u81,0.55,1
Is this correct?,"So i have started studying stoicism and its been two months, and i have been journaling about a month of the thoughts am having daily and the judgements i pass onto things i try to examine those.

I won't go into much details and make this really long. Here's a brief context of the stuff that happened. Well i do corporate job and everyday we have requests which gets assigned to our team and whoever available senior will assign it to the resource who is available on that day. The problem is things get suddenly escalated to higher management and we need to complete those tasks ASAP.

What has happened one of the senior on my team assigned the request/task to me while i was on my week off. I got angry as to why she assigned the task but i did not confronted her because i was angry i just took the action just to remind her not to assign to someone who is in week off.

And i journaled the whole thing.

and it goes something like this.

Anger  
\------------------

An emotion which happens. When thare is Something unjust has happened.

Did that thing did unjust to me?

Well it was unjust. But let's not get into conclusion.

Let's think it this way.

Is assigning tasks is Something People Shouldn't do?Y  
es they should.

If they Should do then whom they should assign?  
The People who are available.

Now did she assign to Someone who was available on that day?  
NO .

I mean you do not serve food to a Person , who is not there to eat.

Then we know that you should assign the task to Someone who is available .

NOW

Is assigning task to Someone who is not available is an unjust act?

Its not an unjust act as she doesn't have knowledge as to who was available and who was not.

Hence anger should not have come there but we did not assent to that and did not made an impulsive act.

When is it okay to give unsolicited advice?,"Hello,

&#x200B;

I tried looking for a similar thread but found only posts talking about receiving unsolicited advice rather than giving it. So, I apologize if I'm retreading ground here.

&#x200B;

Basically though, I find my relationships with my friends suffer because I give off an aloof disposition (not on purpose). Many times my friends will bring up a problem they are having and I'm usually quiet. This is because I am worried about unsolicited advice or otherwise overstepping boundaries.

&#x200B;

I know it's quite okay to voice my opinion when explicitly asked, but find it harder to do so when my friends only imply they'd like advice. And often, I'm not even sure if that IS what they're implying.

&#x200B;

Because of this I think finding a deeper connection is sometimes difficult. Maybe I give off the vibe that I don't care, or perhaps it seems I am trying to change the subject outright.

&#x200B;

I also feel like I am denying my friends the decision as well. And I'm denying them a deeper insight into who I am that kind of prevents them from being comfortable around me. Maybe it seems like I'm hiding something or am coming off judgemental/stern.

&#x200B;

Well, what do you guys think? Am I caring too much what my friends think of me when I'm silent/reserved? Or do I just need to care more about authenticity? And when is proactively giving unsolicited advice acceptable?

&#x200B;

Would love to hear your thoughts on this. Thanks for your time and hope you're all well.

Afraid of how my family would react to my lack of beliefs,"Yeah that's basicallly it. In a nutshell, i was raised by a loving christian family and ended up becoming an atheist a year ago, without them knowing it. 
I love my family more than anything, and they help me a lot, my brother is like a father to me as he taught me a lot of the values i have today, in which some correlate to that of Stoicism.
But the problem is, i stopped believing in God. I am not seeking for religious advice or anything, because it just doesn't make sense to me in believing in a religion again, what i am struggling with is how to deal with it when it comes to my family. I know they would get sad and maybe even exclude me for it... I feel helpless because as far as i am concerned i am the only one in my family that doesn't believe in the religion and that makes me feel lonely and unmotivated.
Not only that, but oftentimes i feel like i am being too selfish, in the sense of ""They did everything to me and now you just leave everything"", specially towards my mom who struggled a lot to raise me.
Its been weeks i am dealing with this, and this questioning in my head is destroying me, i just can't work properly anymore with all of this.
I would like to know how me, as a someone who considers myself a stoic should deal with this, i even considered returning to the faith but i did that twice before and i relapsed back to atheism and i am afraid it could happen again

I started keeping a journal of the worst things that happen to me every day.,"About a week ago, I started keeping a little journal on my notes app of the worst things that happened to me each day.


It has helped me to change the way I view things and to realize just how insignificant most of the little daily “evils” I encounter are. 


This is my list from the last few days:


MONDAY: broke the yolk of the egg I was cooking.

TUESDAY: stepped on some dog poop barefoot.

WEDNESDAY: woke up at 3:30 because my son was crying, couldn’t go back to sleep.

THURSDAY: son went to bed about an hour later than usual. 


This has helped me to stop catastrophizing a ton. I was grumpy all week. And the worst thing that happened was I lost some sleep and some free time and also stepped in poo. If that’s the worst thing that happens this week, fortune’s smiling on me. 


Of course, if I were to get fired, or have a loved one die, it would definitely be worse than those things, but it would likely help me appreciate the good days all the more. 


Try giving it a shot, you’ll likely find that most troubles are not of dire consequence.

Edit to add: I know I should have a stoic journal where I write about how I respond to situations, work on virtues, etc. That being said, I don’t have a ton of time, and this is definitely a 30-second exercise rather than even five minutes",Stoicism,1704491909.0,t3_18ziu36,0.84,15

But show me a Stoic, if you can. Where or how? But you can show me an endless number who utter small arguments of the Stoics. For do the same persons repeat the Epicurean opinions any worse? And the Peripatetic, do they not handle them also with equal accuracy? who then is a Stoic?

Let any of you show me a human soul ready to think as God does, and not to blame either God or man, ready not to be disappointed about any thing, not to consider himself damaged by any thing, not to be angry, not to be envious, not to be jealous; and why should I not say it direct? desirous from a man to become a god, and in this poor mortal body thinking of his fellowship with Zeus. Show me the man. But you cannot. Why then do you delude yourselves and cheat others? and why do you put on a guise which does not belong to you, and walk about being thieves and pilferers of these names and things which do not belong to you?"" Discourses 2.19

Virtue is the only good. Not the reach for contentment.

We embrace/love/wish for whatever happens/has happened and do not worry so much about how other's define/label that. We are happy in whatever is going on because what does that have to do with our character?

We deal with life as it happens, and do not lose our way. This includes opinions, authors and ""sophists"" we do not agree with. As Epictetus and Seneca both share, we can objectively describe a thing for what it is, we observe that a course called ""The Wealthy Stoic"" sounds like a contradiction and a confusion, but it isn't Stoic to then assign that value to the person beyond that observation.

This is Stoicism. If this doesn't feel right, then maybe there is a false impression somewhere in there to work through, or maybe this isn't the philosophy your nature is set to follow?

In love with an addict,"I'm in love with an addict, and I recently our relationship. When I broke up with him, I told him that part of the reason I was ending things was that I loved him too much to watch him kill himself. I was experiencing a lot of emotional distress because of his addiction and the way he was letting it impact his life and our relationship. He's a truly beautiful man, with a heart like none I've ever met and more love to give that I ever knew was possible, but was destroying his health and making it impossible to maintain a romantic relationship. 

From a Stoic perspective, I'm curious how to navigate our post-breakup friendship or whether I should not have one with him.  

Would growing as a Stoic mean learning to accept his self-destructive tendencies, and choose to serve as a support and friend if he chooses to get sober? Would it mean lovingly holding him accountable when he asks for support, and pointing out his patterns when he wants advice? 

Or would growing as a Stoic mean accepting that a leopard cannot change its spots, accepting that remaining in his life may be harming us both more than anything, and walking away?

My plates arrived all broken,"I'm going to move out of my mother's house in July but have already started buying some things and keeping them stored. A week ago, I bought a set of 10 plates from a fancy store, I spent some amount of money on it but nothing out of my reality.

I'm thinking about just throwing the broken plates in the trash (carefully packed of course) and buy new ones soon from a different place.

Question concerning the Stoic view on abuse from family.,"
I have some issues with a stoic view on abusive family and I’m curious how you all interpret the passage. 

Very quick backstory: After years of therapy I’ve stopped speaking with my mother due to narcissism and abuse. 

Stoicism has been one of the most valuable things in my life and has helped me through so much. I have been very troubled upon a re-reading of Epictetus and would love your interpretation.

“Duties are universally measured by relations. Is a man a father? The precept is to take care of him, to yield to him in all things, to submit when he is reproachful, when he inflicts blows. But suppose that he is a bad father. Were you then by nature made akin to a good father? No; but to a father. Does a brother wrong you? Maintain then your own position toward him, and do not examine what he is doing, but what you must do that your will shall be conformable to nature. For another will not damage you, unless you choose: but you will be damaged then when you shall think that you are damaged. In this way then you will discover your duty from the relation of a neighbor, from that of a citizen, from that of a general, if you are accustomed to contemplate the relations.”

In the book A Field Guide to a Happy Life, Massimo Pigliucci’s rewrites Epictetus in more modern language. Here is another example of a stoic response to abuse from family.

“But,” you say, “my mother has been bad to me.” Perhaps, but she is your mother nevertheless, and you should concern yourself with how you behave toward her, not how she behaves toward you. “But my brother has done me some harm.” What do you mean, “harm”? Has he forced you to change your considered opinions or the values you endorse? No, he can’t do that. Then there is no real harm. He may have behaved unjustly toward you, but that is his business. Your business is to behave toward him by considering who he is: your brother.

So, after years of therapy, I have broken off my relationship with my mother. It was a very difficult decision but the correct choice. Reading these stoic passages that I have posted really upsets me. Does Epictetus really expect someone to allow pain and suffering inflicted upon them just because you are related to them? Standing up for ourselves and choosing not to be harmed is within our own power, so I had thought I made the stoic decision to choose not to be harmed anymore. Perhaps this passage from Epictetus is a relic of ancient times in which you could never sever ties with family regardless of the situation.

What do you think?",Stoicism,1704445748.0,t3_18z2mw3,0.67,3
Lost,"

So right now I(20m) am in my third year of college and honestly I have no idea what I’m doing as in I don’t know what to do with my life. The bachelor that I’m studying for now is biology not because I’m necessarily interested in it but because engineering is too hard for me considering I suck at math and political science is also uninteresting to me.
All throughout my life/high school people would ask me what I was going to study and I would always tell them “I didn’t know” thinking that eventually I would know and I could answer their question and my question but here I am and I still don’t know. I haven’t found anything that really interests me nothing to the extent I could see myself devoting time and effort into it. I play a lot of video games but I don’t like it enough for me to learn how to make a game and I watch a lot of movies and TV shows, but don’t like them enough to pursue a career in cinema for example and to top it all off I’m not good at anything(no talent,no secret hobbies,nothing). I’m trying not to sound ungrateful, but to put it simply nothing is ever enough It all feels empty to me. People have told me that it’s normal to be directionless in this stage in life and I understand that but at the same time is very frustrating seeing my friends in college just knowing what they’re going to do with themselves whether it be veterinarians, lawyers, programmers you name it and I wish I could be like them. Needless to say, this is all having a negative affect on me is bad enough to go through life’s struggles, but I would say its worse when you don’t have a “why” to your struggles. I don’t feel like I’m asking for too much when it comes to just knowing what I should do. I’m not asking for that perfect dream job. All I want is to know what I should be doing with my life, something that I can see myself doing for a long time and be good at it, and get meaning from it but I don’t have that and I need help. When somebody asks me, who am I, what are you doing and what am I going to do I want to actually give a real answer. So please advise and general thoughts about it would be greatly appreciated.",Stoicism,1704471679.0,t3_18zaq3a,0.6,1
A Stoic's Code of Conduct and how to achieve Emotional Maturity and/or remedy Emotional Immaturity.,"I've been practicing Stoicism for a couple of years now, and I do see some improvements. So I am not a newbie and I know better that Stoicism is not about repressing emotions.

Like many of us, my upbringing was not perfect (and I have stopped blaming my parents long ago), and I had a lot of ""issues"".  I have come a long way, I do live a ""normal"" life, dare to say ""happy""; some people would even use the term ""successful"" to describe my life and me.

But I am still working on myself, constantly improving.

Recently I am working on my latent internal anger, and I have come to the realization that I am still, probably, Emotionally Immature.

I have got some good comments on this sub recently on related matters, and I am journaling multiple times a day, reflecting on things, and challenging my own *intrusive thoughts* and also my *Belief System* (aka BS).

I have read multiple times Massimo Pigliucci's *How to be a Stoic*, and William Irvine's *A Guide to the Good Life*; they are book good in giving practical examples of Stoic life.

I am looking to make a simple ""Stoic's Code of Conduct"", a list so to speak that I can review multiple times a day, and in case of emergency, and therefore I am asking 2 questions:

1. Do you have such a list or can you point me to one?
2. Can you please review my incomplete list below, and suggest additions/edits?

TIA

My Stoic Code of Conduct:

* Speak positively.
* Don't be sarcastic (I used to do it too much).
* Never complain.
* Judge a situation or a behavior, not the person.  What someone does is not the reflection of who they are.
* Never say anything negative about anyone (linked to the item above), even if it's true (this is regarding work).
* Pursue the Stoic virtues (of course), always.
* Apply the dichotomy of control, always.
* Don't give into consumerism, lean toward minimalism.
* Journal daily: at night reflecting on the day that just ended; in the morning planning my day.
* Be mindful every moment.
* Pay special attention when interacting with people, be mindful.
* When the mind goes into a spiral down a rabbit hole; just stop.
* You can do it. Whether you think you can or you can't either way you're right.
* No gossips.
* No drama ever.",Stoicism,1704420924.0,t3_18yv8qn,0.85,12

Seneca on duties,"Seneca asserts, citing Democritus, that 'a relatively tranquil state of mind is only possible if we devote relatively little time to public or private affairs, or at least to those that are too great for our strength' in Book 3 Chapter 6 of 'On Anger'.

I was surprised by this. Having read the Meditations I had the impression that it was best to drive oneself strenuously into one's duties and enduring difficulties by accepting the present moment and modifying judgements. Seneca himself condemns laziness in his letters to Lucilius.

However both do not offer much information on Stoic logic (aside from what I can deduce from the Stoic principles themselves although I can't claim to have understood those fully at all yet).

From what I understand Stoic logic was in some ways quite revolutionary and very distinct from some other ideas of the time (Aristotle being a prime example) and while no considerable body of work was preserved, what has been recorded is close to propositional logic which of course is very much in use in the modern age.

How to confront lies as a wise stoic? ( using what is within control and outside your control),"My freind and i made plans to buy somethings for her party. We already agreed on the day we were to go.

I then call a freind she lives with, the freind gives her the phone and my freind admits that shes already bought the stuff and shes been busy all day and didnt have time to reply or even call back. 

I know shes lying. In one of the messages i sent her, asking when she wants to go to buy her stuff, she diverts and asks a different question. It seems she was avoiding telling me, and im left wondering why. It seems she would have never admited shew has bought the stuff if i didnt gi the extra mile by calling her freind.  I am wondering why she didnt tell me shes already bought the stuff already. I know shes lying and i refuse to give benefit of doubt.

shes very arguementative and may not admit the lie. Confronting her may ruin the freindship, especially with her birthday coming up, it may be awkward if i attend.

Do i play dumb and not confront or calmly express that i feel she is lying? then slowly just avoid believeing her or trusting her in future.

A Life Direction through Determinism and Stoicism,"Some background: (skip if too long)

I'm 16, and lately I've been really struggling to do anything because of not knowing where I'm headed. It all began a few months ago. I was honestly really doing quite well, to which I mean I started being more responsible, disciplined and was focused on self-improvement. I slept and woke up early, took my studies seriously, did daily chores, etc.

I also journaled to write down my thoughts, which mostly consisted of how to improve myself and live better. On one of these journal sessions, I realized that my actions is mostly just problem solving. So I looked into how to problem solve. I read some stuff, and came to the conclusion that it simply boils down to: knowing WHAT to do, HOW to do that, and WHY do that. You might know where this is headed, but yeah, the ""WHY"" part really had me thinking. Why am I doing all this shit again? Why do I eat, sleep, study, have fun, and all the kit-and-caboodle?

So, naturally, I looked for an answer. If the question is ""why am I doing anything?"", then what I'm looking for is reason (or maybe purpose or meaning? idk I'm unsure still). I read about existentialism, absurdism, stoicism, and a few others, only enough to kinda get the gist of it, and I also did some personal thinking. This was where my mind has been for the past few months, and this lack of reason or direction or whatever, has really had me demotivated and depressed.

However, I think I've reached some sort of answer that I'm content with and I'd like to hear your thoughts about it.

&#x200B;

It goes as follows:

Determinism states that all actions and events result from other actions, events, or situations. The way I personally like to word this out is: ""what is"" determines ""what is to be"". ""What is"" simply refers to the state of stuff right now, and ""what is to be"" refers to how the state of how the stuff right now will be.

""What is"" includes me. What am I? What is the state of the stuff that is me right now? Well I am human. And a part of being human, of course, includes survival. But, it also includes the longing for happiness. And I personally think that the stoic philosophy of building character, having virtue as the goal, answers this longing for happiness.

What I'm essentially saying is: Stuff exists, and how these stuff exist, or ""what is"", determines how these stuff will exist, or ""what is to be"". A part of ""what is"" is what I am, and I am a human that longs for happiness among other things. This determines ""what is to be"", which includes my decisions and actions. Hence, I look for what'll bring me happiness, which I believe is found through the stoic philosophy.

(just to add, I recognize that determinism is usually brought up when discussing free will and responsibility, but here, I focus more on the idea it presents about how our actions is explicable by what we are and what other stuff are.)",Stoicism,1704420821.0,t3_18yv7e9,0.5,0
How to not judge people...,"How can I stop judging people?

When I see their test results I just automatically judge them and think to myself that they probably dont do anything in their lifes but be on their phones all day and dont do anything to change or better themselves. 

I feel like just because I focus on self-improvement, I judge everyone else for not being the same as me, i have the same problems with other views in my life, like with atheism - i dont believe in any gods, and in my mind when i see someone fateful to god i just judge them about how theyre being stupid. I know its wrong to think this way, i never let these thoughts out on other people, but I acknowledge that my mind thinks this way, and i want to change it",Stoicism,1704364912.0,t3_18ya882,0.78,12

I have trouble understanding this passage in the passage before this one, he is talking about all the relations in the world and the Constitution of the human mind to receive impressions in and that this must be the work of a God. Then he ends the passage with the following

"Anger, results and confusion","Ever been lied to? It's annoying, isn't it.

I feel like I've been lied to about a lot of things in my life. Most of them along the lines of ""Just do this and you'll be fine"". Well I did ""this"" and I wasn't fine. These were often people who had duty of care over me and I had little choice but to believe them and ironically were also the people who taught me that not telling the truth was a bad thing.

So deep down, I'm angry. At them for giving me instructions that lead nowhere, at me for being too weak or naive to get the results or to follow the instructions well enough.

If it weren't for that anger I would never have learned to stand up for myself when under attack, it has protected me.

Issue with stoicism practices.,"I bought the handbook for new stoics, and have been working through it starting this year, I've already hit something of a road bump, the first exercise is to take an aspect of your day and seperate and examine what was and wasn't in my control, the issue I'm having is that I don't do much at all, I mostly stay inside, watching youtube or playing video games, I'm diabled and thus can't work.

So I don't really have an ascept of my day to examine, the book suggests things such as lunch with a friend or a work meeting, but I have nothing similar to those, the only thing I've been able to write about is my usage of social media, but if I use that as my example I'll be writting the same thing for each day of the week.

Has anyone else used this book and how did you handle this exercise, and what suggestions would you have for someone who doesn't really have any events in their day to examine?",Stoicism,1704323262.0,t3_18xx3ub,0.72,3

I need your opinion - Marcus Aurelius was a common man?,"So recently I stumbled upon this YouTube channel that barely has any views. In one of their videos, they were saying that Marcus Aurelius was just a common man and not a mighty emperor.

In the video, they said ""Marcus Aurelius was a common man who knew a lot of people, that is why he is still relevant to this day"" 

I´m not sure if it's a language barrier for me and I have maybe misunderstood what they are saying but I think it's important to note that Marcus Aurelius was a powerful emperor yet he never fully bathed in that power or used it in any negative way.

Temperance,"When practicing temperance in a situation where you are offended how should you respond to the person that offended you. In my situation this person is my father in law and my mother in 2 separate situations. Normally I am not bothered by others options and what they say to me because I do not care what a random person thinks of me. However in this situation I value both relationships  and respect both people. I am struggling with how I should feel.

Bushido and Stoicism,"I’ve seen here several people mention how stoicism has similarities to some eastern philosophies. Before I discovered stoicism for myself, I studied the samurai. I wanted to know why they were portrayed as calm people in media and culture. This is one of my favorite quotes and I believe it fits the stoic goal of calmness. Perhaps even fear of death. This comes from Inazo Nitobe (1862-1933). He was born into the samurai class, but was 6 when it was abolished. His book, “The Way of the Samurai” is one of two books that most influences samurai media. That and the Hagakure. 

“The Way of the Samurai” Chapter 4: Courage, the Spirit of Daring and Bearing

“The spiritual aspect of valor, is evidenced by composure - calm presence of mind. Tranquility is courage in repose. It is a statical manifestation of valor, as daring deeds are dynamical. A truly brave man is ever serene; he is never taken by surprise; nothing ruffles the equanimity of his spirit. In the heat of battle he remains cool; in the midst of catastrophes, he keeps level his mind. Earthquakes do not shake him, he laughs at storms. We admire him as truly great, who, in the menacing presence of danger, or death, retains his self possession; who, for instance, can compose a poem under impending peril, or hum a strain in the face of death. Such indulgence betraying no tremor in the writing, or in the voice, is taken as an infallible index of a large nature - what we call a capacious mind, which, far from being pressed or crowded, has always room for something more”

Is the first step to forgiving someone that you perceived wronged you to control your thoughts or your actions?,"There is someone who in the past hurt me. A family member. For a while I was angry but eventually I let go of the anger and decided to just stop interacting with her. I would be short and blunt with her and would not attend events that she would be at.

I realize now that she did not injure me in anyway. The things she said that were true I had no right to be upset about and the things that were false equally were unimportant. 

I am able to now interact with her and be pleasant as if I harbour no negative emotions. I act with her as I think I would if nothing had happened. 

However when interacting with her I feel a negative emotion. Sometimes the remains of anger and sometimes some sort of sadness towards how I was treated. 

I feel as though these are not passions since I am not allowing them to affect the way I act but they do seem to affect my thoughts. It’s something I’ve been struggling with for months. I’m not sure how to approach it further.

In order to be a good and just person should we correct lies we have told or bad actions we have done even if they will hurt the person?,"In an attempt to be a better person I am trying to right things I have done in the past and be an honest person in general. 

For example, in a joint business in the past I was under reporting revenue and over reporting expenses in order to pocket more of the profit. To right this wrong I have a cheque written for the difference to give to my partner. My question now arises in if I should tell him that I was stealing from him all this time. 

As I am someone he trusts immensely this would upset him and I am doing it to make myself feel better. 

I could alternatively lie and say ""I found some mistakes in the numbers, looks like you're owed this much more"". 

Is lying to make him feel better a stoic action?

I've analyzed this situation and I am not scared to tell him that I betrayed his trust. I am able to accept any fall out from it. I would obviously prefer to have him in my life as I consider him a friend but that is a decision I think he should make, not me. 

I feel as though I am starting to ramble now so I will stop shortly. 

I compared the situation to if I was told by a recent ex she was cheating on me the entire relationship. I would feel upset over that and think that it was unnecessary to tell me this additional information after we had broken up. 

The business is still running and I stopped playing with the numbers recently. 


This also made me wonder if we should go out of our way to correct any lies or misinformation we have given people or to just be honest going forward.

Shaving your beard,"Please excuse the paraphrasing, I do not have my copy with me.

Epictetus says that if one is to practice philosophy, their conviction should be such that they are willing to lose their head if another demands they behave in a manner contrary to their philosophy. This is conveyed early on in the discourses in a metaphor about shaving one's beard.

He also says that one should not try to pursue causes that are out of one's control, because not only will one disgrace themselves in doing this, they will have abandoned a pursuit in which they could have performed well. This is from enchiridion 37.

A topical example is a hypothetical US citizen that believes that US aid to Israel is cruel. This citizen decides to not pay their taxes, in accordance with their philosophy. But then they are jailed, preventing them from the good they could have done while not jailed, and Israel still receives the aid because there are hundreds of millions of tax paying citizens. 

Quote 2 implies it is a better idea to just follow the law and pay the taxes. Quote 1 implies that we should not care for the consequences.

Am I misunderstanding? Is there a discourses chapter that elaborates on enchiridion 37?

I made an inappropriate joke to someone and their reply was hurtful. How do I subvert my expectations of being apologized to?,"This is a fake scenario based off of a real problem I'm having.

I'm confused in how to feel and how to respond to they way someone reacted to a joke I made.

So let's say I, Jack, made a joke about vegans to my friend Mark, who is not a vegan but has told me previously that they don't like jokes at the expense of vegans.

After telling my joke, Mark said ""shut up, that's offensive"".

Now, upon reflection I realized that I made a mistake. There's no doubt in my mind that the initial mistake was mine. However I still feel hurt due to being told to shut up.

I have apologized for making the joke, and Mark hasn't apologized for his response. I feel like I expect him to apologize. Should I not?

This is something which isn't yet clear to me in the stoic teachings. I lack ""the wisdom to know the difference"". I know his apology is out of my control, but should (or could) I tell him that it was hurtful and that I would like if he doesn't do it again?

Contradictory quotes?,"Dear Posse.

Does ugliness rub off?  Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius seem to disagree, or can Marcus Aurelius’ words be interpreted into “ugliness will only rub off, if you let it”?

“Avoid fraternizing with non-philosophers [i.e., people who don’t try to improve themselves]. If you must, though, be careful not to sink to their level; because, you know, if a companion is dirty, his friends cannot help but get a little dirty too, no matter how clean they started out.”

Epictetus, Enchiridion 33.6

And 

“When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they can't tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are unnatural.”

The Praxis of Developing a Stoic Mindset - How can we actually start to think and behave Stoically? Here are my thoughts on concrete steps to take to begin moving towards the Stoic ideal.,"# Introduction

It's not secret that as this subreddit has grown, a large number of the topics are people seeking Stoic advice. A lot of these posts are however misguided in a way - they seem to be  looking for a particular kind of solution that you might find in an algebra problem. They want something that they can plug into the equation to solve for X, and thus find a neat and tidy answer to their problem - whether that's a broken heart, the effects of childhood trauma, or disappointment at their lack of self-perceived accomplishment in their lives. Stoicism is not a framework for solving for a particular value of X. It is rather a way of deconstructing the problem such that you realize looking for X is the wrong approach entirely. 

The suffering that people describe as stemming from various events (my romantic partner left me, I feel empty and defeated) is the categorical mistake that Stoicism seeks to address. It is a radical and revolutionary reframing of the human experience that begins with the detachment of human value judgment from the events and consequences that are happening every second of our lives. In simple terms, Stoicism would say that the breaking of your relationship is not the source of your suffering, but your impression of it is. If you broke off an abusive relationship and were now freed from violence and oppression, you would see the end of a relationship as liberation. It is your impression and interpretation of the event which creates the condition of pleasure/pain in your mind. And so Stoicism stretches that to almost every single thing that we experience, and demands that we detach from judging things to be good or bad so that we are not living our lives at the mercy of chance and fortune. Virtue is the sole good, and our virtue can never be affected by anything that happens to us, including physical pain, destitution or death. This is of course simplistic, but I wanted to set the stage with a broad overview before getting to the point of this post, which is:

# **How do I *actually* start thinking and acting Stoically?**

**The first step in developing a Stoic mindset is to develop the habit of having structured reflection about yourself and your life.** This means not only thinking about what you are doing and how you are living, but taking active steps such as journalling, and structured review of your thoughts/actions which you revisit later on. The process of putting thoughts into writing forces you to order them and clarify them. Pure mental thinking is ultra-high bandwidth with tons of noise and emotional baggage that cloud the ideas, whereas writing is a kind of structured thinking that forces you to crystallize your innumerable thoughts, and serves as a record for your future self. Its hard to remember what you were thinking about even a week ago, and it's imperative to have a handle on the evolution of your thinking and feeling. 

So if you are at a loss at where to start, start writing daily. Write about your life and your thoughts every single day. What is happening and what is your judgment of what is happening? What do you want? What do you feel is missing? Alongside this, pick a Stoic text and begin reading it. Don't worry about commentary, just read it for yourself first. Slowly, you will see themes from Stoic texts crop up in your life. Reflect on them - are they applicable? Do you agree with the author? Do you find the ideas persuasive or do you disagree with them? Explain yourself and your thinking. Later on, return to your writing and see if your mind is changing. You will be shocked at what you wrote 1 month ago, 6 months ago, etc. It will be a sign of your progress, and this is critical because Stoicism is a journey of self-mastery, and of self-responsibility. It is imperative you keep a written record. 

# **I'm already reading and journalling - what now?**

Our goal is of course to begin changing our minds, and that means achieving some kind of control over our reactions in real-time. In my view, the critical step is looking to carve a space between **action** and **reaction** in the course of our lives. At first, there is no space - we can only reflect on things hours or days afterwards. But as we continue the process of reflection and meditation, it finally happens - we get a brief flash of space between an event and our impression of it. An example from my own life might look like this:

> *Here is a typically angering situation for me. I can see it unfolding. This is a huge inconvenience to me. This person is completely disrespecting me and my time. I feel my blood pressure rising and my emotions lifting. I want to show my anger to this person, but I know I will regret it later. *

And I would still react angrily. I would say something disrespectful back, raise my voice, and lose control of myself. But still - I had time enough to have the above discourse in my mind. I could recognize it all happening, and I still couldn't control it, **but this is the first victory.** I could see the impression forming. And so then you reflect on the fact that you are starting to see the impression forming, you write about it in your journal. And then it happens again. And again. And you fail again. But then one time you catch yourself and actually manage to shift your reaction a tiny bit. You curb your anger. You take a few breaths and instil calmness into the situation. You are still angry but you're doing better this time. It takes less time for you to cool off after. And afterwards when you journal, you realize that this is the first time you've ever been able to stop yourself before fully engaging in the emotional reaction.

We see posts like these on here as well ""Stoic success stories"" - small but important anecdotes where people relay a situation where they caught themselves about to react badly, and asserted control. These victories stem from the earlier step of creating that tiny space.

As you continue to pile up these 'victories', you assert more and more control over your reactions. In your reflections, you begin to truly understand that when people are being rude or disrespectful to you, it is a reflection of their own hardships and ignorance, and nothing to do with you. You start to truly understand that getting angry is handing ownership of your mind to another, usually a complete stranger, who has already forgotten about you while you are still brewing with rage from your interaction with them. And so it becomes more and more natural to simply not react in these situations. 

# The key is to keep it in mind

The general theme here is that in order to begin to think Stoically, you need REMINDERS to do so. You need some kind of process that injects the Stoic principles back into the active thinking patterns and not just the passive ones that are occurring in times of acute pain. I think for most people, that has to begin with active, regular journalling and reading the Stoic texts. The more you think and write on them, the more they will be in your mind. And the more they are in your mind, the faster you will finally achieve that first 0.01 seconds of space between action and reaction, and then that space will continue to get bigger as you gain control over your emotions and cognition. As you gain control, you start to actually see the process almost from a third person perspective. This creates the conditions for further control, for more space, and the process continues and you can sink deeper into the true Stoic mindset.

As you go further, you are not simply getting better at calming down - you are starting to see the events for what they are, and they lose the ability to affect you in the first place. You actually begin to understand implicitly, not just logically, the foundational truth of the Stoic mindset. The logical understanding of Stoic ideas is not enough - 99.9% of you understand them already, but that doesn't magically change your mind. You need repetitions and practice so that your brain grasps it on an emotional level as well. Over time, you are seeing the problem differently - there is no X to solve.",Stoicism,1704132452.0,t3_18w2gxi,0.94,59
What things are determine what things do. Is this true? What does stoicism have say to this?,"Here's the gist:

* Wise 16 year old gains consciousness 
* Doesn't know why he does what he does.
* Wonders ""what am I doing?"" and ""why am I doing it?
* What SHOULD I do and why SHOULD I do that?
* Wants a clear life direction.
* Tries to figure it out for months.
* Can't figure it out. Isn't satisfied with any answer. Finds despair instead.
* Has trouble doing anything cause of not knowing why he does what he does, or for that matter, why does ANYTHING at all do what they do?
* Reaches some sort of conclusion, which he still doesn't find satisfying so then asks reddit cause doesn't know where else.

~~~

The conclusion:

- Things just exists.
- These things exist in certain ways.
- The ways that these things exist can change.

This is reality.


What things are determine what things do, and what things do determine what things are to be.

ie. What a thing is and what surrounds that thing (the universe/ the earth/ society) determines what it does, and what it does determines what it becomes and what surrounds it becomes. 


If this is true, then:

What to do?
What you do is determined by what you are and what other things are.

Why do that?
What is done is done because of what you are and what other things are.

~~~

So is it that simple? I wake up, I eat, I bathe, I study, I draw, I choose a goal, I love, I survive etc. all because of what I am and what surrounds me? Is it logical? Should I just accept this even though I dont feel satisfied with it? From my understanding it does, but does stoicism agree?",Stoicism,1704205335.0,t3_18wqjj2,0.5,0

Trouble with knowing which emotions are reasonable,"First: I mention some heavy thoughts, but I am in no active danger, so please don’t report this. I am in therapy, but I also want some logical input, because rationalising thoughts helps me. Thank you. 
 ———

To make it brief - I know that the right mindset can change *a lot*. That is what I struggle with the most, right after controlling my emotions (as in, not letting them control me). 


I am in therapy and have also started recently mood stabilisers, as my psych thinks the intensity of my emotions is not normal. But obviously I still need to work in therapy on actively calming myself and changing my mindset. I’m doing CBT which overlaps a lot with Stoicism. 


So:  I’ve struggled hard with guilt, shame, and as a result suicidal ideation for years. I often want to open up to my family about it, but I’ve been told even just breaking into tears over small disagreements is me being “manipulative”.  No words can convince my father otherwise, not even from my therapist. So just the idea of being vulnerable to my father (who has plenty reasons to be disappointed by and angry with me, as he is) and telling him “I don’t want to be alive anymore. And I feel guilty that I know I won’t ever attempt suicide because I believe it would be better for you. But I am too selfish even for that.” is terrifying. Not to be able to tell your own parent you wish to stop living, because you are used to negative responses to opening up, is so painful and invalidating. I don’t want pity from him, I want empathy and to feel loved. My suicidal ideation is real, and I need help. But it doesn’t go away from one therapy session, and I think beging honest about how you feel is important for well being. So not being able to be honest with my own father is… I am repeating myself. 


But is it “reasonable” or “okay” to feel sad that I can’t tell own father how I feel? Can I tell him anyway because it weighs so heavily on me, or should I keep it between myself and my therapist? Because isn’t the **reason** I’m sad that I care what he thinks? Is it “reasonable” in Stoicism that I want to trust and be loved by my parent, to want empathy from him? Or should I work on not caring what he thinks, because then, well, then I won’t let myself be controlled by my wish to get love from him? 


I am at a loss. To not care what my own father thinks of me seems so so cold and irresponsible. I am scared that if I don’t care what he thinks of me, I will might behave in ways that hurt him. 


But then, if he feels hurt, wouldn’t that be his responsibility and because of his mindset? 
But that sounds even colder. 


I don’t know what to think. I just want to be happy, and the man who said I need to ask for help more doesn’t understand that the best way for *him* to help me is to be empathetic.",Stoicism,1704150312.0,t3_18w9k4u,0.8,9

How to maintain relationship with parents while keeping my peace?,"Sorry, it might feel like a rant, but I don't know how to summarize what goes in my mind.

I ooz hate/anger in my head when I speak to my parents when they ask me to do things certain way. I usually listen for one or two times, and then in straight words, I tell them that I dont want to live that particular way  but if they want to, then it is their choice. My father  just switches the topic or hands over the phone to my mom. One time, when I recommended something then my mom said that she would listen from one ear and let it out from other. 

Part of me doesn't want to have any relationship with them, and the other part is like that they are growing old and live thousands of kilometers away.

2yrs ago, I stopped sharing my life with them over our daily calls unless it impacts them in some way. I really dont say much. I just listen to what they have to say about their life and leave it at it. This is out of respect what they have gone through to support me in whatever way, and I know they didnt have it easy.

However, I can't deny I question my choice to call them every single day because for them it doesn't matter as it's part of living life and I overthink. After all this, they try to associate with me, and I have noticed myself being instantly repellant to that association as I don't want to be like my parents. 

I don't mind being the bad person in their lives, but my heart doesn't allow me to cutoff ties or make them lonely or carry resentment as they age as it is not healthy.

People thinking I don't care,"Happy New Year all,

In practicing emotional control and not immediately reacting to a negative situation, has anyone else run into other people thinking you don't care?

Take for example, if a significant issue or mistake occured at work, I used to overreact to show coworkers and management how much I cared, but I eventually realized this caused me too much mental distress, and was not worth it in the grand scheme of life, it's just a job.

Since becoming a practicing stoic, I am getting the impression from others that my calm/indifferent reaction to situations makes them think I don't care, which is an issue concerning I am in management. 

Has anyone else run into this? My thought is my mental well being is more of a priority than what some boss might think of my level of engagement, and that an employer having an issue with your calmness probably isn't one to stay with.

\-*Darth Plagueis*, James Luceno

Yeah i know star wars is silly, but these quotes are the kind of thing that make me question some stoic principles.

Marcus Aurelius wrote to himself ""If it is endurable, then endure it. Stop complaining."" but isn't complaining a natural human response to stress? An stoic can even fool himself thinking that he can endure everything ""endurable"" only to snap like a brittle twig at some point.

Isn't having hope and goals two of the most powerful driving forces in humans? Yet stoicism says hope is the twin brother of fear. And even fear can keep living beings alive, same with anger and stubbornness.

On discussing other people,"An excerpt from Simplicius’ commentary on *Enchiridion* 33 follows this chunk:

The commentary: 

> But above all things, he gives us warning not to entertain our selves, and our Company with talking of other People; neither so as to call their Behaviour to Account, nor to be profuse in their Praises, nor free in making Comparisons between one Man and another, as That this Lady is handsomer than That, or this Man Braver, or Honester than That, or the like. Now there is nothing more evident, than that this Topick does in a more than ordinary manner divert the Soul from its self, and its own Business; for it makes Men busie, and curious, and impertinent, extreamly inquisitive, and troublesome where they have nothing to do. But why should this (you'll say) do so more than any other? And what can our talking of other Men have in it worse than the Subjects mentioned before?

> To this we may reply, That the Person to whom the Advice is here directed, being one who hath made some progress in Philosophy, as not so likely to entertain himself with those trivial Matters, as with something that relates to Mankind, and their Affairs and Actions. So that it was convenient to draw him off from those things especially, which his own Inclina∣nations would most dispose him to; and there∣fore he adds that Emphatical Caution, But above all things.

> Besides, though it be true, That the same Affections are stirred in us by both Discourses a∣like, (for we are insensibly drawn in to love and hate things and Men by talking of them) yet there is one peculiar Vice attends our Conver∣sation, when we pretend to give Characters of other people; which is, That it strangely swells one with Vanity and Pride, and Contempt of others. For whoever he be that pretends to sit in Judgment upon other Mens Conduct, does it out of some imagined Excellence in himself, which he fansies gives him a Right to arraign his Neighbours. And besides, any mistake in our Judgments of Men, is more inexcusable, and of infinitely worse Consequenee than if we pro∣nounce wrong in those other trifling Matters; and therefore we should be very sparing and tender in this Point.

Reflecting on Ryan,"I was blown away when someone on this subreddit pointed out to me that Ryan Holiday's debasement of this philosophy has reached the point of him creating a site called ""[The Wealthy Stoic](https://www.thewealthystoic.com/)"" to openly shill Stoicism as a get-rich-quick scheme.

For years I have been telling people his approach is a poorly disguised get-rich-quick scheme. What he's done has taken all of the cleverness out of that observation - now anyone with eyes can make that observation, which makes me feel a lot less original (and that could be a good thing).

It doesn't anger me when I look at the ""Wealthy Stoic""; the feeling is more like bemusement. Stoicism is exactly the opposite of what he's selling - it's just remarkable that he's chosen such a staunchly ascetic philosophy as his basis for selling people their own greed back to them. Perhaps wrapping one thing up in the other somehow makes the grift more effective.

As the new year rolls in and I start moving towards my fifth year of Stoic practice, it's somewhat interesting to reflect on the fact that feeling as though Ryan Holiday was trying to scam me is what initially sent me to Epictetus, and learning from Epictetus is what unlocked the benefits of the philosophy for me. I had just started recovering from my drug addiction, and I was reading The Daily Stoic and another one of his books (possibly ""The Obstacle is the Way"" but I cannot quite recall). As I read I got the distinct sense that I was reading trite garbage attached to a sales funnel by a person who didn't *really* care for their subject matter, and who was disturbingly enamored with extremely wealthy people who had diddly-squick to do with Stoic philosophy. Feeling certain there must be more value to the philosophy than what I was being given, I googled something like ""who is the most respected Stoic"" and was directed to Epictetus. I purchased my Penguin Classics copy of the Discourses (Kindle edition of course - I wanted to start immediately) and I never looked back.

I can recall an overwhelming sense of joy and relief when I realized that not only was the philosophy far from the trite, vague nonsense Holiday was portraying it as, but I was reading one of the most profound forms of thought I'd ever seen written down - a distillation of all the wisdom I'd acquired in beating my addiction, plus a cognitive mountain of completely verifiable and entirely unique claims about the mind that I'd never have been able to come up with on my own, and which I now use every single day when reasoning about how to live my life. 

I live an honest life. I feel happy - I feel like I never lack courage and that I do not need to lie to anyone. I have a wife I love and I'm content with what I have - truly content, as in if I had my current circumstance for the rest of my life I'd die happy. Better yet, if every single object I owned were lost in some freak accident tomorrow, I'm fairly sure I'd be no less content - I might need a week to get my bearings, I'm far from a Stoic sage after all, but I doubt I'd need much more than that. 

It's strange to feel that way, and to have felt such a profound benefit from the practice of this philosophy, only to then see the person I once thought of as its titan looking haggard and exhausted, shilling get-rich-quick schemes on a scammy-looking website. It drives home a point the Stoics make themselves - that the wealth and power of the Emperor counts for nothing. To Ryan Holiday, Stoic philosophy is nothing but a way to grift - like any criminal, he makes his money robbing the unaware and scamming the credulous. To me, the philosophy taught me how to be happy. When I help people to understand Stoicism I don't do it for money, and I get to feel honest at the end of it, something I suspect Ryan Holiday hasn't felt about himself in a very long time.

Happy 2024 everyone. Let's all try to surpass Ryan Holiday this year. ",Stoicism,1704068442.0,t3_18vkufu,0.92,83

My first point of concern is if I am doing something wrong or harming myself in any way by studying and applying stoicism?? That's my biggest concern right now. I am reading stoicism a lot and it has brought to me a lot of changes. I need to know if I am setting myself up for some bad outcome.

Here's some changes that I have observed after starting stoicism.

1. I have stopped getting post jut clarity. I know it sounds silly but it's a major concern for me. I used to have post nut clarity for when I used to feel low or needed to clear my mind. Now I can't. But I do get some resemblance of post nut clarity when I am reading stoicism. So I don't really know if that's a good thing or bad thing.


2. I have become way better in making friends. Earlier I used to have trouble getting respect from people now I am doing good not as much as I would like but far better than earlier. But I think I have lost my charming capabilities too. Earlier I could enjoy parties and be fun there too. Now I just dont see any point in parties. Everytime I see someone enjoying parties and getting out of control, I start judging them which is a wrong thing.


3. My other concern is that girls don't follow stoicism and it makes me prone to getting cheated on. Somehow I can't shake the feeling that getting complacent and indifferent leads to your partner getting a free hand and cheating on you.


4. I would really appreciate a mentor who has been actively practicing stoicism for a long time now.


Thanks guy in advance.",Stoicism,1704139098.0,t3_18w53bk,0.6,2
Holiday's Influence,"Just thought I'd mention this since I've been seeing some posts about ryan holiday. 

I've seen Stoics here mentioned that despite the twisted and misconstrued picture holiday paints about Stoicism, many people end up finding true Stoicism. Therefore, holiday may not be doing too much harm, but rather a benefit to people. 

I'd like to challenge that by telling my experience. 

I first heard of Stoicism in college, around 2016. I don't recall if it was on a podcast or a YouTube video or an article, but I came across holiday talking about the Meditations and Marcus Aurelius and Stoicism. 

And when I heard him, I easily saw he was just talking bullshit. And I completely disregarded Stoicism too. 

Fast forward, I graduated and got a job in finance in 2018. And one day while at a colleagues desk, I noticed he had the Meditations of Aurelius. This seemed to me to be a confirmation of what holiday was selling: Stoicism as some broski, hustle, self help bullshit that would be big with finance bros (like my colleague).

Of course I was wrong to associate Marcus Aurelius and Stoicism with holiday's bullshit. It wasn't until this year that I really got into Stoicism. And in all of those years, I didn't give Stoicism a chance because I (erroneously) associated Stoicism with bullshit self help. 

To be fair to me though, (and my point), holiday, in my experience, did not only not lead me to Stoicism, but also contributed to the impression that Stoicism was just a bunch of hustle culture self help bullshit. 

I could only speculate how better my life would have been had I given Stoicism a chance and read the Discourses. But that's futile. 

So just as holiday might help bring people to Stoicism, he might also help people push Stoicism away. And so, in this way, holiday might not be helping people. 

What's left for us is to simply guide people away from holiday and redirect them to Stoicism.",Stoicism,1704097173.0,t3_18vsd29,0.69,6

Stoic values and Career,"I recently began reading a translation of Epictetus’ works. In one part of it, he says it is better to be poor and starve to death in tranquility than to live anxiously in abundance. He also says “you can always win competitions in which winning is up to you”.

Now I have recently decided to take a big leap in my career by giving an extremely difficult exam and move abroad. My reasons are that I will be at the top of my career (and very good at my job) with a significant improvement in pay and a better work life balance. My reason for leaving my country is bad work culture & toxicity, being undervalued, bad working hours. The whole process of moving abroad is extremely difficult and taxing. Reading the above stoic advice has got me confused because this goes directly against it.

I really do want to achieve things and be pretty good at my job. Pay is secondary. However, I do value a good work life balance. Should I adopt these stoic values and change my mind about this huge step I am going to take? Is there any other view this? Please help.",Stoicism,1704095224.0,t3_18vrwl1,0.67,2

How should a Stoic treat anger.,"I was talking about stoicism with a friend and we were on the topic of not being angry with things you cannot control. He partially agreed, but then said “What if anger at an injustice motivates me to do a good thing? Would that be against the stoic philosophy?” He proceeded to give a hypothetical situation in which a person sees an injustice system that causes kids to die from starvation and a person gets angry at the injustice system and, in turn creates an organization to help the starved kids. The end goal is a just action, but since he is driven by anger at the injustice system, would the action align with stoic views?",Stoicism,1704060891.0,t3_18vihqo,0.87,12

Responsibilities,"I know that the idea of control is talked about to excess. What I can control what I can't control what I should try to control or other misunderstandings. I don't like the word control and I personally think it's a bad translation of the concept. 

Isn't it more productive to instead concentrate on what our responsibilities are? That's a much easier question to answer. What is your responsibility and what isn't your responsibility? Are you properly accepting responsibility for the things you say and do? 

Some things are our responsibility and some things aren't. Trying to accept responsibility for the actions and reactions of others does a disservice to them as maybe they're supposed to be learning a lesson. Trying to make someone else responsible for my actions and reactions does me a disservice because it removes my opportunities to learn and grow. 

For example if I had a child, to say I'm in control of the child would be not very correct. But I'm definitely responsible for the safety of the child as far as I'm able. I can't control the safety of anyone 100 percent.

Today I went from being right to being wrong. So much for my Stoicism practice.,"Today I was wronged. Someone did something.

I remedied, took matters into my own hands, and with effort and work, I remedied someone's malice or stupidity (Occam's razor).

Stoicism teaches us: 

* I did well. I used wisdom, courage, and justice.
* Now move on, continue to practice virtues, and - why not - do great things with your life.
* It's all done and over with.

But I had to confront that person, ask them why they did what they did. They lied and turned things around, accusing me of not telling the truth. So not only they wrong edme, but now they were trying to do the switcharoo on me? And falsely accusing me?

I tried to reason with them, nope, there was no way. I distanced myself and I reported to their company.  Then, later on, on my way out, I picked up the conversation again, which continued on the same note; till I lost my temper.

So, from being on the right side of the fact I become the villain. I was, the a-hole.

And this is where Stoicism is correct:

* What had happened (when the person wronged me) was outside my control.
* I was able to control some actions that I took to remedy.
* The entire event, now in the past, is 100% outside my control. There's nothing that I can do to undo what was done. Stoicism teaches me to do nothing, because there's nothing to be done. That is the wise thing to (not) do, that is the just thing do to, that would be a manifestation of moderation.

The actions that I took instead, the things I said, the letting my anger take over losing my cool were my doing, I did that, I allowed that, I went into the rabbit hole and continued to go down.

And now I can't sleep (ruminating) and I have been re-living those events for the past few hours. What a waste of life.

Now more than ever I see how the Stoic teaching are correct, always seek to be virtuos, by practicing wisdom, justice, courage, and moderation.

And by distinguishing what is within our control and what is not; and act accordingly.

And to be aware of impressions, since:

> We form our judgments and opinions based on what the Stoics called “impressions.” In broad terms, all stimuli (and our unthinking interpretations of them) are impressions.

Today was an opportunity for me to practice Stoicism at its best. If I had done that it would have been very low effort, just ""doing nothing"" really. I could have moved on with my life, doing something productive in the past few hours, and by now I would be sleeping like a baby.

My life is indeed the summation of the choices that I make, and Stoicism is a great co-pilot, if I choose to follow its advice. Everything that matters is 100% within my control. What is not doesn't really matter.",Stoicism,1704003082.0,t3_18v16fa,0.94,16

Do you have any advice or pointers to things I should read?

I struggle a lot with internalizing stoicism.,"As a on and off practitioner of a few years, I understand Stoicism in theory, but I find that knowing something consciously doesn’t necessarily result in it having any effect beyond that.

For example, I know other peoples opinions don’t matter, but I still find myself insecure and dependent on their opinions emotionally. I suspect this is because I haven’t truly internalized the beliefs into my perspective. 

Thus, how does a stoic internalize their knowledge and assimilate it into their perspectives?

This is not a test. This is the real thing.

When your 40 minute drive becomes two hours or your spouse uses more plates and forks than they need and it's your turn to do the dishes or a non-human animal under your care needs to shit some time around 4 am and you always prefer it be outside of the house so you wake up your brain, raise your body temperature a bit and go outside, sometimes you find yourself contorted.
All tied up in a knot for the duration of the bad thing. You're annoyed or angry. You wish to be in a different mental state.

Ask yourself:

Is this not life? In these moments when my (probably not deeply thought out) immediate preferences aren't met, can I not be satisfied? Can I only be satisfied if what I think I want is what I get? No. That seems like asking for trouble. Pre-meditated suffering. 
If I can learn to enjoy traffic then I'll always be satisfied.

Good thing I am protected from the elements, robbers and great distances in my private metal box. It's not what I wanted, but these moments are also my life. I will not spend them lamenting or wanting anything other than what I get. At that point, it's too late to get otherwise. Accept the consequences at once so you can relax your breathing, straighten out your spine and focus on finding pleasure or contentness in the places you're not paying attention to.

(but you can't live without doing that) I don't spend on unnecessary things and don't eat at fancy places, I am still a college student and don't eat out often and most expensive meal I had on my own is $12 and that too twice or thrice a year.  But when I eat I usually see homeless person as I walk home from that place.

I am aware of very close person I know who suffered domestic abuse and had their life turned upside down, their religious family recognize the abuse but don't want them to divorce.

"""Isn't the foolishness of a few a more precious commodity than the wisdom of the masses?""-Fate Zero","Gilgamesh: I am fond of lives of hubris. People who harbor grand ambitions without realizing that they are unequal to the task. The mere sight of such people gives me great enjoyment. There are two kinds of arrogance. One where you are unequal to the task and one where your dreams are too big. The former is common place stupidity...but the later is a rare species that is difficult to find.

Kirei: But they are identical in that they are both fools, are they not?

Gilgamesh: Isn’t the foolishness of a few a more precious commodity than the wisdom of the masses?There are those who were born human but harbor wishes that man was not meant for...and have renounced their humanity in its pursuit. I never grow weary of watching their grief and despair. Kirei, what of you?(dialogue from fate zero)

When I read alittle about Gilgamesh, the story says he wished to become a God, one of the Gods. To which the gods agreed, giving him a series of trials which if he passed, he would become a God. One of them involved staying up without sleep for seven days and seven nights which he failed. So in that paragraph where he ""never grows weary of watching grief and despair"", he's engaging in abit of Schadenfreude against himself and all like him. The Stoic sage is an ideal, obtainable? I don't know, but would the stoic sage be considered a human or a God?, a God I think. So isn't it's pursuit a form of renouncing one's humanity on some level? Plato's philosopher king encourages himself  in  his Meditations to ""stick to what seems right""(the best goal to achieve, the one we fall short of when we fail), and to ""celebrate behaving like a human being, however imperfectly"". Well, I feel like we should have a Stoic Failure Story tag to encourage empathy, vulnerability and authenticity even further in this community.

 Arthur Koestler theorized that; when children are impersonating adults, a comedian is impersonating a public figure, men are disguised as women and women are disguised as men. The impersonater is perceived as himself and as somebody else at the same time. That while this situation lasts, ""the two matrices are bissociated in the spectators mind. And while his intellect is capable of swiftly oscillating from one matrix to the other and back, his emotions are incapable of following these acrobatic turns. They are spilled into the gutters of laughter as soup is spilled on a rocking ship. Here I am thinking about Chrysipuss, who Seneca believed ""saw the very bottom of truth"" dying of laughter. Koestler further adds that ""we are literally ""poisoned"" by our adrenal humours, reason has little power over irritability or anxiety. It takes time to talk a person out of a mood, however valid the argument;passion is blind to better judgment; anger and fear show physical after affects long after their causes have been removed. If we could change our moods as quickly as we jump from one thought to another, we would be acrobats of emotion"". And I'm not sure why but this brings to mind Arriana Huffington's quote, ""sleep is a feature of the human operating system, not a bug"". Which is why Gilgamesh probably failed to become a God. ""But what says Zeus? ""Epictetus, if it were possible, I would have
made both your little body and your little property free and not
exposed to hindrance. But now be not ignorant of this: this body is
not yours, but it is clay finely tempered. And since I was not able to
do for you what I have mentioned, I have given you a small portion
of us, this faculty of pursuing an object and avoiding it, and the
faculty of desire and aversion, and, in a word, the faculty of using
the appearances of things; and if you will take care of this faculty
and consider it your only possession, you will never be hindered,
never meet with impediments; you will not lament, you will not
blame, you will not flatter any person.""_Discourses 1.1. I heard Peter Theil once say that if someone could innovate a pill that would safely eliminate the need  for sleep, he would move the world from zero to one. In a way though, this person would be considered a fool, the same way we think of Socrates, Diogenes, Epictetus as having moved the world from zero to one for championing a philosophy that has stood the test of time. And yet I feel these guys where probably considered fools on some level in their time, just as I believe they would be considered fools in my current society if they lived now as they lived then. ""..the truly original geniuses are rare compared with the enormous number of talented practioners; the former acting as spearheads, opening up new territories which the later will then diligently cultivate. There are periods of crisis, ""creative-anarchy"", leading to breakthroughs to new frontiers, followed by decades, or centuries of orthodoxy, consolidation, stagnation and decadence-- until a new crises arises, a holy discontent which starts the cycle again....""_The Act of Creation.

Making excuses and justifying for people that wrong me.,"Whenever people wrong me and treat me unfairly, I get angry at first but then I begin to find them a lot of excuses for their behavior and make up reasons for why they are the way they are. In the end, I give up on my rights or cause and resign myself to thinking that it is what it is.
However, this gives me sadness and a feeling of defeat.

What would be a better way to handle this, as a begginer stoic?",Stoicism,1703927352.0,t3_18ubmhv,0.86,5
Today I dealt with a toxic person in a stoic way,"Long story short 2023 was a really bad year for me, I was learning about stoicism but got away from the path at some point and let my negative emotions and anxiety dominate me 

I was super anxious about a college exam and so asked my friend if I could go to his house and say that I was worried, after that I got a bunch of messages from his jealous and egocentric girlfriend (who I used to call my friend) calling me a bitch that I was trying to have sex with him and saying that I was ugly and etc 

I tried to explain that I just wanted someone to talk with and even said that I was aroace but she ignored it

After that I noticed that I need stoicism back to my life and read meditations and took the idea of the 2.1 text “ I shall meet with the busybody, the ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial. All these things happen to them by reason of their ignorance of what is good and evil. But I who have seen the nature of the good that it is beautiful, and of the bad that it is ugly, and the nature of him who does wrong, that it is akin to me, not [only] of the same blood or seed, but that it participates in [the same] intelligence and [the same] portion of the divinity, I can neither be injured by any of them” 

And realised that that’s how she is, she’s aggressive and insecure and there’s nothing that I can change about it, today she tried to hurt me again and I simply ignored her, why bother with toxic people ?",Stoicism,1703875341.0,t3_18tu41m,0.93,72
FOOD ADDICTION,"I am 19 years old and I live with my mom. I’ve been dieting since I was 15 and I have lost 60lbs total, but lately I have been having trouble keeping off the weight and I binge eat. I noticed it was much easier to stick to my diet when I was living with my grandpa as there was no food or people to tempt me to eat. MY QUESTION: do I stay at my moms house and grapple with my diet or do I move to my grandpas house where it’s easier to stick to my diet?",Stoicism,1703949354.0,t3_18uhsmr,0.54,1
How do I control my frustration towards others?,"Recently I’ve felt like I’ve been getting angry or frustrated over the smallest things, including statements from my parents. I’ve tried to calm my emotions, meditation and other techniques but I end up either yelling or getting unnecessarily angry at them due to miscommunication and not being on the same page. 

A recent example of this is my mum nagging me on getting a job (it has been a year since I’ve been unemployed) however during the start of the year she stopped me from getting/applying to new jobs due to my studies and exams. Now in these couple of weeks she’s  been complaining why I wasn’t working throughout the year, saying that, after being unemployed I “gave up” and was “too lazy”to find a job to her friends on the phone. In addition, she also complains/yells that the reason of no jobs accepting me was due to my appearance?!?! That it was because of my moustache and bleached blonde tips (note I am Asian, and she dislikes how I do not look like the stereotypical southeast Asian). Moreover, she sometimes doesn’t realise I’m trying my best, yes I agree I can be lazy and impractical, but they always disregard on what I Do and focus on what I Don’t (not sure if that made sense haha)Like I’ve been really trying my hardest to find a job. This lead me to lashing out and having an argument about it, and yet in the end nothing was understood between us on what we were trying to state, and she ended up pushing it off and blaming herself, that “it’s all her fault”. The same scenario has occurred with just different topics and statements ending in her blaming herself for being a bad mum.

This always made me feel bad, every time I’ve had an argument with my family members I always reflect on what I said and what I should’ve done instead of what I did with my actions, hoping that next time I’m met with this situation I can stop it from getting any worse. 

And I always remember that it is also their first times at living life and that they are also trying to figure their own lives out. With this I really do love my mum and I know she wants the best for me, I never want to see her sad or feel like a failure, she has gone through a lot of struggles and done so much for me, but sometimes our misunderstanding and miscommunication gets under my skin which leads to my outbursts of frustration towards them. 

But I hope that next time I’m able to calm myself in these scenarios so that we are able to communicate better, to be in the same page.

Any tips, techniques, books can help me out would be appreciated!!!

Thank you for listening to my TED Talk haha

how can I stop worrying about these things that are out of my control," Title. I am an 18 year old guy, and for the past week, I have been experiencing fatigue, nausea, dizziness, and derealization. I was in a very bad rabbit hole a couple days ago, that I still am some-what still in, but have gotten ALOT better.

I kept googling, searching on reddit, trying to figure out what was wrong with me, and so I started to think I had: long covid (since i got it in july) , CFS, diabetes, kidney disease, bppv, dysautonomia, candida overgrowth (which ive now found out is fake), sibo induced symptoms (since i have gi issues for over a year now) , gastritis induced symptoms, you name it and i probably thought I had it.

I've found out alot about myself while going through this whole rabbit hole, and I've realized that im not really scared of ""death"" per say, I am more scared of not living my life because of a chronic illness not allowing me to live my life, and there for because I keep worrying about that, I don't really live my life.

My anxiety has gotten so bad, that now I can't really go to the gym without thinking I am having a heart attack or I keep focusing on the littlest things when working out. Like how much I yawn during my workouts. While I do think most of my symptoms are from my anxiety, I just can not help but think in the back of my head that there is some chronic condition that I have, that is also causing these symptoms. I just don't know what to do. I am trying to look for a therapist, and potentially get an evaluation done to see if maybe I'll need anti-anxiety meds?

My question basically is: how can I stop worrying about these things that are out of my control like dying, or developing a chronic illness that doesn't allow me to ever function or live my life again, and while all my friends are out partying or living life, I will be bed ridden and depressed.",Stoicism,1703889378.0,t3_18tzixa,0.79,8
How do I not be obsessed with my appearance?,"Ever since I was a child I have always been self conscious about how I look. Over the years I have gone on a dozen fad diets and am always on and off going to the gym. 

Here is the thing, when I am fit I get more attention, people give me the benefit of the doubt more, people trust me more, my friends want to be around me more, I have way more success in dating. Anyone who has been both ugly and attractive has lived through and knows this. There are also many research studies that prove that attractive people are perceived as more likable, receive higher salaries, and get far lower prison sentences. 

Now, I have read enough stoicism to know the stoics thought appearance to be an indifferent because it has nothing to do with one’s character. I am just struggling to internalize this and truly believe appearance doesn’t matter when clearly it impacts a lot about our experience as humans.",Stoicism,1703889197.0,t3_18tzgbw,0.76,8
Are we always in control of our thoughts and reactions?,"I'm completely new to Stoicism and currently reading ""The Little Book of Stoicism"" as my introduction to the philosophy.

I've come to the point in the book where freedom of choice is being covered in depth, specifically the idea that we're unable to control external factors in our lives however we always have control over how we perceive and react to these things, the section also mentions that only we have the power to ruin our lives.

I'm struggling with these concepts a bit.

I believe we can control how we react and behave to an extent but only within our given biological parameters paired with the environmental stressor. I think certain situations are harder for some, easier for others.

E.g. 

- There are people who have behavioural difficulties that descrease impulse control
- There are others with severe mental health issues which can cause executive dysfunction
- Addicts exist whose brains will crave a substance as though they would die without it (they may also suffer with one of the other bullet points to boot)

While a ""good"" choice can still be made, the ability is reduced when compared to neurotypicals with good mental health.

Despite the above, I've still found the ""You can always control how you react"" approach really helpful. My worst life decsions have been made when emotions are running high, there have been had countless past worries that I've tortured myself with causing unnecessary suffering.

I've tried to adopt a more mindful approach when my emotions are high and I've seen good results... however there's a limit. If lost everyone I cared about tomorrow, I would be unable to remain calm in the same way Viktor Frankl did or see this as something indifferent to my eudaimonian. (Things we cannot control being seen as ""perferred indifferents"" at best.) My happiness is partly tied in with those I love and I'm not sure I'd want that to change because it would feel like cutting myself off emotionally. I get that it's unhealthy to entirely rely on those around us for happiness, but for me to care is to be emotionally invested. I believe that to love is to accept the possibility of emotional pain.

I'd like to get thoughts from those more familiar with the philosophy though please.",Stoicism,1703894447.0,t3_18u1fx5,0.8,6

Overcoming a major life mistake,"Would appreciate some guidance on how might a stoic best navigate a major life mistake?

I feel humiliated and defeated.  I know the past cannot be changed.  So all I can do is calmly set about dealing with the consequences in the present.

My mind, traditionally very determined and focused, is lacking the discipline to stay away from the humiliation mindset, the negative self talk, and the desire to keep going back to the past to fix things.  I allowed the initial situation to jar me so deeply that I fell in a vicious cycle.  That cycle drained everything out of me.  I speculate that’s why my previously strong mind seems almost unruly now.

How does one regain one’s head after losing it?  I don’t know if perhaps any of you has had any personal experience with this.

Stoicism in the face of injustice,"I'm wondering, as I haven't been through all the literature yet, how do stoic deal with severe types of injustice.

For example: A mother fought very hard to safeguard her child from an abusive husband.
The child is safe now.
However, disease and misfortune strikes the mother and after a long struggle, she dies, leaving her child vulnerable again.
All the while, the abusive father runs rampant, never being held accountable for his deeds, experiencing the bare minimum of bad luck.
Worst case scenario, custody gets transfered to the father.

In a more severe case, this is the story of a sibling; or your mother.

How do stoics interpret these events; how do you deal with the sense of injustice in such situations?

Moving from fear of death to acceptance of it,"I’m looking for some stoic perspective on thoughts of death and negative visualization.

Recently, a few months ago, I had a surgery and ever since then my little mind is obsessed with the thought of the implant causing my death eventually. Thus, I notice I fear exercise, stopped hobbies, seeing friends, have no motivation for life. Some would call this a depressive episode, and suicidal thoughts were there for a few weeks but I overcame them after some time in therapy. As residue I feel like the fear is a  constant.

While I know that these are just thoughts, they seem to subconsciously define my living now. I keep analyzing my symptoms, the physical pain sensations, and mind feeds me images of me dying. And instead of accepting them, I fear them and am obsessed with them. I find it impossible to focus on anything else. Prior the surgery I found negative visualization a very powerful technique for relief and gratitude but now it only feeds the fears and suffering. Weird.

I have read a bunch of posts here on health, aging, and death, but I felt like reaching out nevertheless. Does someone wiser here have any perspective to offer me on this situation?",Stoicism,1703846640.0,t3_18tkdef,0.79,11
"Recently started studying stoicism, what direction to go for better emotional control over things I cannot change?","A little background, most of my life I’ve been extremely stoic without even knowing what it was. Until I was 26, I would even say it was bordering on pathological and uncaring. I went in the military after high school and had never found anything emotionally difficult in my life, be that deaths of family or friends or anything else. I felt nothing, no honor, pride, or anything, even regarding my time in the military. Everyone would tell me how weird that is to not be proud and I never really understood that until now. 

At 26, my life took an extremely sudden turn. Following the break up with the only woman I had ever loved, suddenly, and if by magical intervention, I began experiencing emotion on a level I failed to control or understand. The first six months were absolutely horrible but since then I’ve been able to for the most part control it. But it has been an incredibly weird and interesting learning curve. Even though I broke up with her a year and a half ago, I am still vastly more emotional than I have been at any point in my life prior. Everything from movies to friendships to failure with women, etc., has caused some kind of emotional response whether it is something I can control or not. 

The last six months I’ve been back in the gym, picked up boxing, and studying/reading about a lot of topics. Just generally continuing my self improvement. Once again I have found myself upset at something I can no longer control. I finally set up a date to ask a woman out who I have known for over a year, just for that very same day to be the day she told me she is finally in a relationship again. There’s nothing I can do now, I missed my chance and anything other than supporting her would be wrong. 

This has prompted me to look into and begin studying stoicism. I dusted off a book a friend gave me several months ago called How to Be a Stoic: Using Ancient Philosophy to Live a Modern Life. I have been reading and taking notes. So far I have been extremely pleased with this ideology. I honestly think this is my solution and my framework for learning how to channel my old stoic behavior towards things of which I have no control while maintaining this newfound emotion for things in my control.

I’d greatly appreciate any help pointing me in the right direction regarding authors, books to read next, or any stoic philosophers that come to mind in my situation. I am very excited and hopeful that stoicism will help me reach what I am beginning to expect it can. Stoicism just seems like the perfect framework for balancing out my life. 

TLDR- For most of my life I was very stoic until a break up caused me to become quite emotional. After studying stoicism the little I have, I believe it can help me channel my stoic nature towards things changeable and my newfound emotion towards things I can change.",Stoicism,1703817065.0,t3_18tbvhg,0.81,15
Diversity of thought in Stoicsm,"I would love to hear everyone’s take on a few related questions:

1. Diversity in early Stoicism: Do you think there was greater diversity of thought among the early Stoic philosophers compared to modern interpretations? 

2. Influence of surviving texts: Considering we learn about Stoicism through the few texts that have survived, to what extent do you believe our understanding is shaped, or perhaps limited, by this? Even among these sources aren’t there differences and contradictions?

3. Embracing diversity of opinion today: Given the potential variations in early Stoic thought, could we be more open to diverse interpretations of Stoicism in our community?",Stoicism,1703855247.0,t3_18tmqxv,0.75,2
Dreading the dawn of a new year and beyond it,"Some of you might be thinking, aren't t people supposed to be happy and feeling fresh for a new year. Well not so much for me. I'm a teenager. I got to put up with harder subjects, difficult teachers, in a new environment because of changing classes and having to put up with my family's reprimands or strict ideals. I know this might all sound minor.

But to top it off, I've experienced possibly the most gruelling period of my life I had ever faced. You might want to read my posts back in around April-July this year. Assuming that you've read my posts, I have developed a trauma towards the whole experience. I do not want to degrade others with much worse traumatic experiences. I'm afraid that next year I will have another ""gruelling period of my life"". Now the one back in April-July left me traumatised, so it makes the fear much more scarier. I'm not traumatized by the event itself, but the process of overcoming it. I went through a lot of struggle just to cope and overcome. And it was so arduous to go through that now I am intensely afraid of experiencing that same pain and struggle of overcoming another occurrence. Sometimes when I come across scenarios where the atmosphere feels similar to one of the situations back then, I would actually start to become self-conscious and panic. I would physically feel my heart starting to feel uncomfortable. Again, from an external view, this might seem a bit minor but for me it was definitely damaging so bear with me.

A part of me knows going through it is necessary for growth and learning. Since it was exactly that period of April-July that forced me to find something to help cope with things, that being finding Stoicism. Any similar hurdles in the future may also present the same kind of opportunities. 

But I can't help but worry and fear that similar things will occur in the next few years of my life. Just imagining having to go through so much of that same traumatic struggle. And this trauma causes the fear of suffering to overpower the fear of remaining static or the lack of growth. I also can't help but worry about the far future of my life as a whole and all the difficult things I need to deal with along the way. But I'll assume I won't live that long, and even telling myself this isn't enough (I am not suicidal by any means).

I'm aware that there are many stoic doctrines that can help with my situation or that this anxiety is just fleeting and should just live with it. But despite that I still can't help but worry. And I'm really starting to lose my ground to the present. It just keeps occupying my mind full of these scary images. And I don't have the time or privacy to randomly close my eyes and spend 5 or 10 minutes to mentally rehearse all my approaches(that's how I personally do it).

Is there any semblance of a Path offered in Stoicism?,"I was having a discussion with a friend of mine on the differences between Buddhism and Stoicism.

In many Buddhist traditions, there is a clear path to follow towards an enlightened state of mind. E.g., Lam Rim in Tibetan Buddhism. This path involves a defined set of practices to follow that are graduated according to different capabilities. Meditation is the core daily practice in the path.

By following a path, I mean following practices hat are different than simply acting as if one was in the end state already (acting in an enlightened way). For example, in Buddhism, there are practices of focusing on the breath or another meditation object; also practices of doing body scans of various parts of the body. This has little to do with enlightenment itself, but is more about training the mind in ways that are conducive for enlightenment.

In Stoicism, we hear of the most ideal ways to act in multiple life situations, but are there any paths or practices offered by the philosophers to work towards making those ideal ways to act come spontaneously (vs. just trying to act in a stoically correct way as much as possible from the beginning)?

"Running away from ""change"" but how to stop that in 2024 ?","

I'm not sure what the right phrase is like comfort zone, change, responsibilities, take life serious, take actions. I feel like I've been avoiding working on my life for almost 2 years now and now that 2024 is about to come in few days. The feeling of regret and shame is boiling down internally. I'm reflecting so much right to a point Im feeling overwhelmed and emotionally mentally exhausted. I realize my mistake and I don't blame nobody but me. I knew I was suppose to not let failures stop me but for years I just accepted it and live in this passive life mindset. I didn't have the guts or courage to stand up and make a change. I'm already in mid-20s but barely have any work experience besides fast food and retail store aka people call dead end jobs. My age group people have already some finished college, working in desired field jobs, in a relationship, overcoming fears, living in the adulthood independent life instead of staying with parents. Meanwhile I ask myself like what am I doing and when is my time gonna come in life. For how long am I gonna sit home scrolling phone and avoiding life. Sooner or later life is gonna slap me yet I'm already feeling all this all but I'm just not understanding why am I not taking action. Am I trying to avoid failure, wanting to be a perfectinism, scared to take action, face life sighs idk. If I don't help myself than nobody will.

Following my passion or following what my parents think is best for me.,"I (M,23, working class) hardly go out, I study at college (it's free here) and live in a developing country. I have friendships that are not really friendships since I hardly interact with them and I don’t have much in common, in reality I just have two true friends which I see seldom. My mother (F,41) says that I need to get out of my shell, wake up, go out more and I just realized that what I really like is art, which is a great coincidence; however, I am very clear that I want to dedicate myself to art and design, after drawing since childhood and coming up with stories, ideas and new narratives since childhood also and being part of an NGO and doing great things for the Marketing Department. I also decided I could look for groups with interests similar to mine. My mother, however, tells me that I have to look for other environments besides the one I want, to see how the real world is, and that I have to open up to other environments and that she can accommodate me in a job with my father where I can learn how to relate to other people, but that is not what I want at all, because I feel that I would be betraying myself and my ideals if I take that job. She is also looking for opportunities for me within her job, and says that I have to open up or else, I will be lost for many years like my father (M,41), who has been in the limbo of jobs he didn't like until he found a stable job (although, my father always wanted to be a full-time musician but wanted to find other jobs out of necessity cause he had a child, me, even though there were lots of opportunities as a musician). I have also worked for a Google Partner agency for some months but they fired me cause I couldn't meet the KPIs, and honestly, I didn't like that job and also had school and my volunteering at the NGO. That is my problem, choosing between dedicating myself to what I like fully or doing other things and leaving art and design as a hobby. As additional information, I have gone through diagnosed Generalized Anxiety which was crippling at the beginning but that over time it has lost power, and really in social environments I have trouble staying focused and I tend to be extroverted in some situations but according to my mother I do things that are not relevant or that are not socially acceptable (basically I lack social skills and everyone can step on me, as she says), such as asking an Uber driver politely if he can change the music being someone I just met today, or asking them (my parents) what they are talking about when I get to the table with them, that according to her. She also told me that I have to adapt to this society that is very superficial, in this developing Latin American country, since she lived it that way. Basically image sells way better than intelligence and competence, and she is saying about my attire and that I need to dress better, to which I agree. What can I do about it? What would be your advice? I understand that she wants the best for me and cares for me considering the situation in which we live in, but I just took a path I realized I didn't want once with my first degree, and lived in fear and pending for other people's approval for way too long (to which my mother disapproves because she says that if that was the case, I would be working on myself already).

About things you cannot control,"I am new to this. What i understand is stoicism focuses on things you have control on, how to control things you can control. By default, humans are bad about distinguishing what they are in control of, and what they are not, and they are bad about actually controlling things they can control.

However, does stoicism promise to completely let go of things you cannot control, no matter how grim, exhausting and horrible they are? In the sub i noticed a frequent answer of ""Do you have control on it? If not, just go and focus on things you have control on"".

 To me its not realistic, to just not care and not be bothered by things you dont have control on. Similiar to be a buddist monk, to let go of earthly desires etc. Those who actually achieve that are born in temple culture and has no metropolian city problems in the first place. 

Maybe you can be bothered less, maybe you realize they are not that important to be bothered so much and let go, but can a hypotetical person John, who is cancer, is 4'5'' height adult male and in a third world country with a very toxic family, with no way out of his house, achieve to be not bothered by all this?

Thinking less extreme, i see its completely normal to be bothered by being unattractive for example. It is objectively hurting your social status especially dating. Maybe you are not absolutely doomed, but to simply say ""just focus on things you have control on"" sounds a shitty advice to be honest. ",Stoicism,1703760742.0,t3_18sr89r,0.72,6

December’s Trials,"The month of December’s been a real test. In order of sequence.

* Mass Layoffs in my organization. I was forced to lay off 12 people on my team. About 70%.
* My cat of 12 years was diagnosed with lymphatic cancer. He died two weeks later in my arms when we euthanized him while he was starting to have congestive heart failure.
* We got a call my wife’s father was going to pass. Got on a 5 hour flight to a different country the next morning. He died 3 days later when we were in the room. Difficult scenario. Multiple religions. Multiple cultures. His burial wishes were odds with the family. I had to mediate between passionate people.
* Got a respiratory illness on the plane there, kicked into full gear by the time I flew back.
* Multiple hour plane delays.
* By Christmas Eve I got gastritis. Recovering now.

I had Stoicism by my side throughout. Quick reminders to calibrate me at the thousand moments throughout it all.

When my cat passed, I remember feeling grateful to have premeditated on this event for many years, never having lost an opportunity to enjoy him. Taking comfort in knowing I did my best to save him. And helped his passing when nothing else could. I’ll miss that little guy. But he’s been restored now.

When I was mediating a difficult family situation I anchored everything around what my proper role was in this family as a husband of a wife. A son-in-law. A guest.

When I got sick I recall being grateful for an opportunity to be reminded how nice it was to be absent of symptoms. There was one day I had a 7 hour migraine, pain piercing through all thoughts except a thought that I desired for things to be exactly as they were.

There were a thousand moments for Stoicism. A thousand reflections. It saved me from so many passions. But I won’t lie to you and pretend I was free from them.

When my cat passed, I was angry at the universe for about a day. In temporary disbelief, even though I witnessed his passing with my own eyes. I was inconsolable.

Now that I’m through it all. I have to admit I am exhausted. I would even go as far as saying I feel depressed. Like missing joi de vivre. Like the world lost some saturation in its colour. I cannot diagnose the cause for this, so I am giving it some time.

We go through these things because we have to. The only choice we have is in how we choose to take it on.

I recall Zeno’s story of the dog and the cart. I recall Marcus talking about what bearable pain is. I recall Epictetus and his many lessons about loss and one’s proper role. And envisioning how you’d like to maintain your character in adversity. I recall many of the people of this community, their insights and advice to others.

Looking for the source of a quote by Marcus Aurelius,"I'm looking for the source of a quote about criticism. I believe its from Marcus Aurelius but I can't find it. I googled and found a reference to it here:

[https://dailystoic.com/how-to-not-be-afraid-of-criticism/#:\~:text=As%20Marcus%20Aurelius%20writes%2C%20if,and%20already%20be%20fixing%20it](https://dailystoic.com/how-to-not-be-afraid-of-criticism/#:~:text=As%20Marcus%20Aurelius%20writes%2C%20if,and%20already%20be%20fixing%20it)

>""As Marcus Aurelius writes, if that criticism is correct and we are in error then the person criticizing us has done us a favor by correcting it. If they are wrong, what do we care? More likely, if we are doing our job right, we should already be well aware of the issue that people are raising and already be fixing it.""

EDIT: Please... this is about the correct source of the quote and not about Ryan Holiday. IMHO quotes without specifying the source of the quotes are almost worthless because then you can't check the context of the quote.

But so far I was unable to locate this in the Meditations. I did find Meditations 5.3 which is similar but not the same:

>\[3\] Judge yourself entitled to say or do anything that’s in accord with nature, and don’t let yourself be talked out of it by any criticism or argument that may follow as a consequence. If it was the right thing to do or say, don’t put yourself down. Other people have their own command centers and their own impulses, and you shouldn’t let your attention be caught by them, but carry straight on,6 following your own nature and universal nature, two things that share a single path.

Epictetus Encheiridion 42 is similar:

>42. When someone acts badly towards you, or speaks badly of you, remember that he is acting or speaking in that way because he regards that as being the proper thing for him to do. Now, it isn’t possible for him to act in accordance with what seems right to you, but only with what seems right to him. So if he judges wrongly, he is the one who suffers the harm, since he is the one who has been deceived. For if anyone should think a true composite judgement\* to be false, the judgement itself isn’t harmed, but the person who has been deceived. If you start out, then, from this way of thinking, you’ll be gentle with someone who abuses you, for in each case you’ll say, ‘That is how it seemed to him.’

Can somebody please give me the source of the Marcus Aurelius quote (Meditations book/chapter) ? I don't want to use this like 'Somewhere in the internet I found that Ryan Holiday said that Marcus Aurelius said that,,,""

Thank you in advance.

Oh, BTW, if I'm incorrect and its not from Marcus Aurelius then I made a mistake and feel free to correct me, I will not be harmed :D",Stoicism,1703761895.0,t3_18srj8d,0.8,3
"Breaking the cycle, how?","Hey fellow stoics, I have some questions that I like to gain some insight in. Also, sorry for using a throwaway.

Some background about me. I have what I would consider a successful and fulfilled life. On the other hand I have always dealt with some mild level of anxiety, depression, perfectionism and self doubt. Not exactly to the point where I consider this clinically relevant but it's still annoying and probably the root cause of some of the issues I dealt with for years (if this is relevant I can go into details at a later point).
I have some formal (university level) training in philosophy and stumbled on stoicism a couple of years ago. I read Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and a couple of others.

So here is the issue: on a rational level all of stoicism makes perfect sense to me. I can subscribe to almost all if not all of the points, BUT... I feel like I struggle big time applying them to everyday life. How much varies by occasion but in general I blame this to my latent anxiety issues. I want to give two examples:

I have a rather annoying and difficult neighbour. This person is for some reasons, which I can partly empathize with (although I'm legally and morally in the right), angry at me and tries to make my life harder. To this date almost all of the stuff are minor incursions, making noise, minor insults, throwing rubbish over the fence in my garden now and then. Rationally I know perfectly well that I should ignore him, that I should just continue to live my life. This situation continues for half a year now and the agressions Come in waves. Whenever there is a new set I'm losing my composure and start spiraling into a fear hate anxiety thought spiral which wrecks my whole day. When I try to rationalise this there are still the physiological symptoms, heart beating, muscle tension etc. This immediately pulls me back.

Second example are certain interactions with my son. There are certain instances where his behaviour is triggering my rage and this is 100% out of that I love him and see that a certain behaviour in his future will probably hurt him and so I have to somehow deal with this. Whenever I throw a fit I immediately regret it because I realise how irrational this is. Also there mostly the physiological reactions suck me completely in and my rational brain shuts off.

Those are but two examples where I have a huge cognitive dissonance between how I know I should act correctly and how I actually react.

To elaborate, a year ago I was about to marry the love of my life with whom I was looking forward to starting a family shortly thereafter.  I’m 36 now.  We broke up in January over a personal tragedy of mine.  Now not only do I still have that personal tragedy to live with the rest of my life; I lost the woman I wanted to build a life with.  The personal tragedy left me with fewer prospects at a time in my life when I had already started feeling the pressure to start a family.

Struggling to balance the teachings of stoicism with other conflicting philosophies,"I (19M) recently got into stoicism this last summer, as the teachings of self control and freeing oneself of anxiety deeply resonated with me. Marcus’ Meditations was actually the first book I’ve completed out of my own interest, rather than being forced to read by a school curriculum. I began to implement many of the stoic teachings into my life and found mostly positive results.

However, recently I’ve started to get into conflicting philosophies, such as Machiavellianism and I have picked up books like Robert Greene’s 48 Laws of Power to supplement this interest. Through reading works like the 48 Laws of power, I came to a realization that it is nearly impossible to balance these 2 differing ideologies at once. Both these ways of thinking resonate with me in different ways, both being equally compelling.

Against Nature as Grounds for Compassion,"*  Musonius Rufus, like the other Stoics, advocated love for our fellow man. So then, what justification does Rufus give for compassion? He argues that compassion is in accordance with human nature. He justifies this by pointing to what we can observe in both human beings and bees, with both species cooperating with their own.
* My problem with this is that all kinds of things we would consider evil, such as rape and murder, are also part of human nature. Does that mean we must do those things too?
* Rufus would, I believe based on certain passages, counter this by saying things like rape and murder are hated and punished in all societies, at least within the boundaries of said societies (native American tribes would have no qualms about hurting members of other groups).
* The problem would be that this is a justification based on social consensus. It would be essentially saying ""Society approves it, therefore it is right"". And yet, there are things that societies past and present have approved of that are obviously immoral. Child sacrifice, female genital mutilation and ritual animal torture are things that have been or still are practiced and approved of under social consensus, and the reader of this message would most likely reject them with vehemence.
* Therefore we must conclude that nature, whether it be the nature of individual humans or the nature of society, is no grounds for compassion. ",Stoicism,1703699673.0,t3_18s6mnh,0.67,1
Emotional Repression w/Misapplication of Stoicism,"
u/SimonDK1994 brought up a very good point to my previous post: 

1.	⁠Make **S**ure to acknowledge your feel**i** n **g**s. People trying to practice stoicis**m** tend to surpress feelings before they learn th**a**t they should actually acknowledge them more and THEN deal with them rationally. This can lead to pinned up emotions and at some point send their world crashing down.(Ask me how i know)

I have been reflecting on it a lot more, and realize that I’ve actually been repre**s**sing my emotions *a lot* more than I thought. So I did more studying, and I’ve concluded the following: 

If there is a situation that ruffles me up, such as the train being delayed, I feel inpatient and angry. Because I’m trying to practice Stoicism, I usually would remind myself “Be calm, there’s nothing to be angry about.” This never actually wor**k**ed as **i** would *pretend* that I’m calm and **b** el **i**eve I was succee**di**ng, but inside I was reaching my boiling point. The issue here is that emotions are dependent variables, so we cannot simply say “Don’t be angry, there’s nothing to be angry about” as the anger has already been produced. If I want to not be angry, the anger has to genuinely not come in the first place. If it does, that is when we should reason to attempt calm ourselves down, not to pretend that we can just will our emotions away. Wait, is that what Epictetus meant when he said, 

“*For this reason also it is ridiculous to say, “Suggest something to me.” What should I suggest to you? “Well, form my mind so as to accommodate itself to any event.” Why that is just the same as if a man who is ignorant of letters should say, “Tell me what to write when any name is proposed to me.” For if I should tell him how to write Dion, and then another should come and propose to him not the name of Dion but that of Theon, what will be done? What will he write? But if you have practiced writing, you are also prepared to write anything that is required. If you are not, what can I now suggest? For if circumstances require something else, what will you say, or what will you do? Remember then this general precept and you will need no suggestion. But if you gape after externals, you must of necessity ramble up and down in obedience to the will of your master. And who is the master? He who has the power over the things which you seek to gain or try to avoid.*” - Discourse 2.2 “Of Tranquility from Pertubation”

If we injured our leg, it has already been injured, so just telling yourself to calm down is like telling someone to “just walk” on their injured leg.

So then we need to focus on the independent variable(s). Would that be our impressions? ",Stoicism,1703661595.0,t3_18rutqx,0.88,6

Life not going my way. People talking badly about me. How do I handle it?," 

Hello!

To give some context, I'm a medical student. I'm quite poor and racking up student loans, but I chose not to get a job because I cannot handle my school workload along with work. I have to say a lot of these medical students are quite wealthy, well connected and are related to doctors who can help them learn, show them resources and etc. I don't have any of that. I came from a poor immigrant family. I got discriminated by ethnicity and wealth. Now in med school, I'm somewhat struggling, not failing but not in a comfortable position in terms of grades and skills. Unbeknownst to some people med students can be some of the most toxic people you'll meet: Hypercompetitive, back stabbing, fake and etc. They constantly lie that their skills and grades and purely out of their natural intellect instead of admitting their connections and money helped (Some of my classmates will voluntarily say that they read the textbook but I later found out they don't and used outside studying material or they got jobs in the hospitals because their parents worked there and had connections, but refuse to acknowledge that; there was a pattern I noticed. In my city, it's currently hard to find a job right now and when I applied in the summer none hired me. The only classmates I knew who got hired were the ones who admitted their parents worked in the hospital.

Some of my classmates have been talking badly about me. Some of them have slandered me. I also have to fund my parent's retirement because they didn't save enough. At this point in life I kinda want to give up. I am disadvantaged, my classmates and even some of the unit nurses have talked badly about me. I deal with this regularly since I am in school or studying most of the time. I am not handling it well.

Best book / text that talks about indifference,"Hi there, 

I have very little exposure to Stoicism, knowing only the basics. I have pretty sever OCD and intrusive thoughts and I have tried to deal with them through meds and talking therapy. I feel like I know the origins of my thoughts and the core beliefs from which they stem. I can also manage to gain some composure and control over my compulsions. 

However, I am trying to get to the place of indifference to my thoughts/fears. I have been single for 10 years because every time I start to date and get close with someone the fears of loss and abandonment start, and then its often been a fulfilling prophecy. I would like to become indifferent to this, 

Are there any specific books/stoic philosophers that might be helpful for me to read, to learn how to get into this practice? I am aware that suppression is not going to help  and that we can confuse suppression with indifference if we are not careful!

How would you proceed in my situation from a stoic point of view? Advice for dealing with a flaky friend,"A friend I considered close has disappointed me and out of curiosity I would like to hear how others may choose to act in this situation (from a stoic point of view).

A month ago I had a low point and messaged my friend if she could call me whenever she was free. No response.

A month passes and she completely ignores the message. I know she'd been out partying etc. At the very least she could've messaged me just to let me know she's a little busy and will catch up when she's available etc. out of respect. 

Additionally, I usually spend Christmas with her family because I'm in a foreign country and I've gotten close with them; they are always so caring and kind to me. Before this silent month, she had mentioned the invite from her parents again. But since ignoring my message she also never followed up on that invite or bothered checking on my Christmas plans etc. I also did not feel comfortable reaching out to inquire about coming over for Christmas since she hasn't even had the courtesy to open my message. 

Finally I receive a lame message from her on the 23rd about how she apparently didn't notice my message and that she's been busy working and fell ill on the week etc. 

I love her but I know she has tendencies to be...entitled and kind of unreliable. Not only with me but that's her core personality. She does what feels best to herself in the moment dealing with the consequences later. There's also been one other ongoing issue (nothing too serious but still enough for me to get annoyed and insecure) that I've tried to communicate to her but her behavior has not changed and I'm not sure I'm comfortable tolerating it anymore. 

I haven't bothered to respond to her message yet. I considered just ghosting her myself snd not talking to her again. Is that a bit too strong a reaction?",Stoicism,1703551315.0,t3_18qvdts,0.71,4

"""The beginning of philosophy ... is an awareness of one’s own weakness and incapacity when it comes to the most important things."" -- Epictetus","Kind of going back to basics on this one (from Discourses 2.11).  Came across this as I was reflecting on my struggles with letting go of past mistakes.

How would a stoic react to bullying?,"

Just graduated from high school, but the entirety of my last semester was spent being gaslit and bullied by one of the school’s favorite students. They promoted her as the most perfect person in the school so I felt like there was an ideal I could never measure up to as a boy, meanwhile she constantly mocked and belittled all of the boys in our class including me, but when I tried to tell the teachers about it she targeted me specifically.  She gaslit me into thinking I was some kind of monster she couldn’t feel safe around and I was scared to go into school most of the time. When I tried to talk to her about it, still thinking she was a good person, she got the teachers to shut me down entirely. Now I was not only being manipulated and bullied, but I couldn’t defend myself. Meanwhile the school, a Christian school btw, promoted her as the most perfect and Christ like student.

"Question for veterans and seasoned stoics. Stoicism had its boom, but what details of this philosophy were left behind?","Like many, I became familiar with Stoicism because at some point it became mainstream. The basics are there, but I'd like to ask the veterans of this philosophy a few things. What part of Stoicism is ignored in its most commercial version? Is there any aspect of Stoicism that has been given more importance than it should? Is there any concept that has been distorted?

For example, I understand that Stoicism also dealt with metaphysical issues. This is not something that is mentioned frequently. Is it not talked about because it is not so important for this philosophy or because it has been preferred to ignore it so that Stoicism can adapt more and better to our society?

Practice of stoicism or complacency?,"Lately, I have tried to speak up more in situation I don't like.

1) The Original Way: Accept that everyone out there is playing a role in my growth and the burdens I am given are just tests that I must accept and deal with them.
2) The Other Way: Speak up, try to change the situation if given, but if it doesn't, then accept it.

Applying principles in day to day life,"Hello, folks.

I have read about Stoicism for some time now, and am slowly but surely making my way through a number of books. My initial introduction was quite by accident when I encountered Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. This has also led me to read Letters from a Stoic - Seneca (I am not finished), and some of Epictetus (Discourse and selected writings. Translation,etc...by Robert Dobbin)

So much of this seems to make sense to me and I think there is real value in this philosophy. However, being so new to this, I am having difficulty in translating philosophy to concrete actions that I can take.  Amongst the most simplistic, but incredibly difficult for me to do is changing my mindset. For example, Epictetus states, “Man is disturbed not by things, but by the views he takes of them.”,and Marcus Aurelius states writes, ""Do not waste time on what you cannot control.”

What are concrete steps one can take in this direction? 

I have read the [Advice and Coping With Problems Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/wiki/advice/#wiki_advice_and_coping_with_problems), and again this makes sense when Epictetus wrote in Discourses that this takes time. (In answer to a man wanting a fig.) ""Let the tree blossom first, then put forth its fruit, and finally let the fruit ripen. Now although the fruit of even a fig-tree is not brought to perfection all at once and in a single hour, would you still seek to secure the fruit of a man's mind in so short a while and so easily?""

How does one even plant the seed of fig tree to begin with? 

* Are there concrete steps that one can take to plant the seed? 
* Once this seed is planted, are there concrete steps that one can take to build the mindset to manage how one views things?

Thank you for your advice and allowing me a moment of your valuable time!

A Stoic approach to dealing with a parent who has early-alzheimer's disease?,"I'm 19 years old and my mom has early-onset alzheimer's disease. She was diagnosed at only 50. It's not been easy at all.

I wouldn't say I'm new to stoicism, I've read Meditations, Discourses, and Letters from a Stoic. I've been interested and learning about it for a few years now, since before my mom's diagnosis. The issue is that learning about it and applying it are two very different beasts, which I'm sure you all know.

It's silly, but for some reason I feel like this is a true stoic ""test"" for me: facing an insurmountable tragedy I have no way of helping.

How do I navigate the future? I understand that this is something I have no power over; it is completely out of my control. But how do I actually *apply* that to myself? When I first started learning about stoicism, it was relatively straightforward to internalize because I wasn't facing something like this. But now that I am... I'm realizing just how difficult this philosophy really is to apply when tragedy strikes.

Senecas view on frequent travel,"Hi everyone! I just started reading ""Letters from a Stoic"" by Seneca. In Letter II of the book, Seneca states the following:  
""To be everywhere is to be nowhere. People who spend their whole life travelling abroad end up having plenty of places where they can find hospitality but not real friendships"".

I wanted to pose an argument to this statement. I am hoping to have others chime in with their own view / a response that may have been expected from a person like Seneca:  


Is it necessary to be somewhere? I argue that the brief and admittedly capricious interactions with other travellers and locals often exceeds the knowledge and wisdom that is to be gained at home. If I prioritised a friendship at home at the expense of gaining new cultural perspectives or wisdom from people I meet abroad, would I not be prioritising a passion over wisdom? Could the desire to form friendships not be interpreted as exactly that, a passion? Wisdom is a virtue part of the true good. Would it not by necessity be more valuable to seek out wisdom that is not otherwise to be gained at home, at the expense of lasting friendships? Sure, wisdom and new cultural experiences can be gained at home, but there is an air of complacency with lasting friendships that do not stimulate new perspectives the same way that frequent travel abroad does.   


I would love to hear your opinion and perspective! I would love to be made aware if I have misinterpreted something as well. Thanks!",Stoicism,1703387116.0,t3_18pm0fq,0.6,3
Finding meaning in life,"Stoicism has already helped me in becoming a better person. I can focus better on my studies, I go to the gym regularly now. When I have a hard time getting out of bed, I think about, what Marcus Aurelius said in Meditations:

>>At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: “I have to go to work — as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for — the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?”
So you were born to feel “nice”? Instead of doing things and experiencing them? Don’t you see the plants, the birds, the ants and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks, putting the world in order, as best they can? And you’re not willing to do your job as a human being? Why aren’t you running to do what your nature demands?
You don’t love yourself enough. Or you’d love your nature too, and what it demands of you.<<

But right now, I really struggle with finding any meaning in life. I feel depressed almost every evening because I'm thinking ""What am I doing all this for?"" The problem is that I've always found meaning in a partner. And now that I've been single for a while I'm finally wondering what else there is to live for.

How Stoicism is helping me stay alive (from suicidal ideation),"Even if I can never truly be considered a Stoic, I am determined to try my best to become as close as I can to it. For some quick background; I’ve grown up in poverty, suffered years as a child through sexual abuse, I’ve attempted suicide near the beginning of the year and have been admitted to the mental hospital 4 times this year, lost my job, evicted, cheated on (after 4.5 years) - ending my first relationship, lost all of my friends, kicked out of college etc. I am not attempting to elicit sympathy. I see suicide brought up quite often in the subreddit, so I am trying to offer my assistance. As of such, please correct me if I am misapplying and/or misinterpreting any of the ideas. 

**1. Virtue: COURAGE**
Life is feeling quite uncomfortable at the moment; Just as I believe it can’t get any worse, it just keeps throwing more and more surprises my way. Although I am working to *change* my outlook on life, my current belief is that life will not get better and I will just experience more suffering. I *suppose* that this isn’t true, but I genuinely do not believe its falsehood - **yet**. By practicing the virtue of courage I am accepting that fact and living *in spite* of that belief. As corny as it sounds: it takes courage to live. Courage is not living in the absence of fear, but to live *despite* those fears and discomforts. 

Another aspect of courage is *actually seeking professional help*, and having the courage to put my faith in these professionals’ hands. It was hard as I had ZERO faith that it would work, but lemme tell ya, **it’s working**. 

**2. Epictetus, Discourse 1.18 “That we ought not to be angry with the errors (faults) of others”**

 “*Learn that a thief and an adulterer have no place in the things which are yours, but in those which belong to others and which are not in your power. If you dismiss these things and consider them as nothing, with whom are you still angry? But so long as you value these things, be angry with yourself rather than with the thief and the adulterer.*” 

I use this concept to cope with 1: The infidelity and 2: The years of sexual abuse I’ve been through. Regarding the infidelity, their loyalty is exactly that: *their* loyalty, meaning it is theirs to give and theirs to take back whenever they please. Even if they agreed to give it to me, nothing hinders them from betraying that agreement. In this case, they have chosen to take it back, and therefore have communicated this to me through their actions. At that point, it’s up to me to decide how I respond to what they’ve communicated - we are no longer together. The decision to end it is not about hating or resenting them. If the only thing in my power is the right use of appearances, then I’ve concluded the following: It’s because I want loyalty. They’ve proven to be an unreliable source for that, and therefore it would be senseless to desire something from someone that they’ve *proven* to be unable to provide. 

**3. Epictetus as an example**
I mean come on, Epictetus has been through some awful ass shit. He is an amazing example of Stoicism at work. I have trouble following advice if the person giving the advice *only* knows the answers through theory as opposed to practical application. Epictetus completely blows that out of the water for me. If HE can do it, surely I can. 

**4. Epictetus, Discourse 1.24 “How we should struggle with circumstances”** in combination with **Discourse 1.5 “Against the Academics”**

“*It is circumstances (difficulties) which show what men are. Therefore when a difficulty falls upon you, remember that God, like a trainer of wrestlers, has matched you with a rough young man. “For what purpose?” You may say. Why, that you may become an Olympic conquerer; but it is not accomplished without sweat.*” 

“*But, you may say, there are some things disagreeable and troublesome in life. And are there none at Olympia? Are you not without comfortable means of bathing? Are you not wet when it rains? Have you not abundance of noise, clamour, and other disagreeable things? But I suppose that setting all these things off against the magnificence of the spectacle, you bear and endure. Well then and have you not received faculties by which you will be able to bear all that happens? Have you not received greatness of the soul? Have you not received manliness? Have you not received endurance? And why do I trouble myself about anything that can happen if I possess greatness of the soul? What shall distract my mind or disturb me, or appear painful? Shall I not use the power for the purposes for which I received it, and shall I grieve and lament over what happens?*” 

I have been given the faculties to deal with everything that has happened to me and everything that *can* happen to me. With that in mind, I have the knowledge that by using such faculties I am making them stronger and therefore becoming stronger myself. This, if anything, takes me RIGHT out of my suicidal episodes. Yes, the things that have happened may seem horrible, but I’ve *endured* them and grown from them. It’s like; yeah, that’s a big ass mountain, but I **climbed** that big ass mountain. THAT is what’s important. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHJHHH",Stoicism,1703303940.0,t3_18ox2tm,0.88,40

Mindfulness for War Refugees / Survivors,"Hey everyone, I'm a war survivor in my mid-twenties who've found refuge in a neighboring country.

Does anyone else get massively dissapointed in themselves when they react based off emotion? How do you deal with that?,"Hi everyone,

How do you guys deal with reacting based off emotion?

 Lately I have been having kinda shitty days (I know this isnt an excuse) and I just sometimes do things that I very am dissapointed in.

For example just today when I was cycling back from the gym I see a family standing in the middle of the cycling lane like dumbasses. Now here's the bit im dissapointed in,  I gave the guy (I assume the dad) kinda like a death stare. Not a massive big deal I know but still.

What good does that do? Nothing. Will that prevent them from doing that again? Probably not. Will I get my ass beat if I do that to the wrong guy? Possibly. Maybe they didnt even know that they were on a cycling lane.  I immidietly after that was so dissapointed in myself. Like dude are you a baby?

I know that I am in control of my own actions/reactions. I cant control what others do or say. Some people are just not very thoughtful,(?) of others. Not everyone has the same norms and values. Maybe they were even new to the country and dont even know how the traffic rules work. I should pity them and not react in a hateful manner. But sometimes its just so grrrr, you know?

Do we have to control the good in us?,"So I just woke up and started thinking about something I said yesterday. I told someone that in every human being there is good and bad and we have to accept the bad in us and learn to control it, so it doesn’t take control over us (as in overtaking us ig).

Now I’m thinking a stoic would probably tell me that we need to control our good too, as moderation is usually key. But then what’s left? Do we need some sort of balance because we can’t let go of our control of the good, because this will ultimately lead to back to the bad (e.g. maximizing joy in the moment, which leads to short term satisfaction but results in long term negative consequences (additional e.g. impulsive, reckless behavior)).

Does it all boil down to gaining as much control over ourselves as we can?

Questions about humanity and passions,"Hello there! Im new here since i just saw Stoicism in school, lol. Now, it was quite an interesting philosophy! I like it :D

But i have some questions:

Mrs Teacher told us that stoics must control their passions and use reason instead, so that way they act in a wise way. Passions arent necesarilly bad, some are good, others bad and other regular. But thats why they need to be kept under control.  If people get carried away by their passions, they dont act in a reasonable way and only cause more damage. I asked Mrs Teacher how much damage, she said ""Greed, war, hatred, etc.""

And i was like HOLY COW. 

1 - Passions really damage so much? The reason of why there is so much hatred, racism, war, greed and more, is because that most humans are passional beings and not rational beings?

2 - Also, how are we supposed to control our passions?

3 - If we somehow made that education promoted reasoning and all humanity became rational instead of passionae, how much better would the world be?

My social skills are terrible,"Hello, M17 here. I'm not exactly sure how to begin explaining my situation but i'll give it my best. I've always been a very quiet person, but thing is i don't think i'm a so called ""introvert"". I want to talk to people, i like it, it makes me happy to socialize with friends but the problem is i cant. I don't know how to i guess. I'm scared to talk to strangers, though this has gotten better over the last couple of years after i've convinced myself that not everyone is negatively judging me 24/7, but my stubborness of talking to strangers is somewhat still there. And to get to the main issue, I don't know how to talk, even to people i know! I simply don't know what to say when i'm talking to somone, and so when for example i'm in a group of three, i'll just end up being next to the other two listening what they say and not contributing anything to the conversation. I try to think of something to say but nothing comes out and as i've said before, i simply don't know what to say.
I'm not sure why i'm like this, but my guess is how i grew up perhaps? When i was 4 y/o me and my mom moved to a completely new country. My mother did not know a word on the language. I don't remember much of when i started school, but i do remember i did not have friends, and this was probably in 1st grade. So really i've never had many friends either. Today i only have one truely good friend whom i am able to talk to. But as i've said, when someone else joins us, i am unable to speak, yet my friend has no problems...
I even joined my local volleyball team (because i like the sport) and I would say i'm somewhat friends with like two guys, but even then we don't hang out after practice except video games. I want to be able to join them talk after practice, but i just end up looking at them.
I'm just lost at what i should do, how can i learn to talk?

TL;DR I don't know how to speak, I want to talk but whenever i try, nothing comes out of my mouth and my mind is empty.",Stoicism,1703293175.0,t3_18otskl,0.88,12
I care too much about what others think of me.,"I (19F) have found myself to become increasingly overly concerned with how others perceive me and what their opinions of me are. I don't know how keep these concerns at bay. I am plagued by this fear of others disliking me or talking bad about me behind my back so much that I spend a considerable amount of time thinking about it. I am either thinking about what exactly about my personality is so off-putting or I am thinking about how I can manufacture a false personality to make myself more laid back and appealing.

A week ago, my best friend and his family, both of which I am very close to, invited me over for dinner and this wasn't the first time that this invitation was extended to me. My best friend's brother has a new girlfriend who showed up to this dinner and although me and her had barely exchanged any words beyond a hello, it was disclosed to me that this person does not like me for whatever reason. I am so confused and my mind does cartwheels trying to figure out what I did wrong when I do my best to be personable and kind to those around me. I know this is unhealthy and I shouldn't be so wrapped up in this but I can't help it. I don't know if I even like this person and there's a likely chance my friend's brother and his girlfriend will break up in due time yet I still care too much. Heck, I don't even know when's the next time I will be in the same room as this person.

This little incident is just one example of many where information was revealed to me about or I had found out by myself that a person who I thought I was cool with no longer approves of me and it's always something stupid and simple like people unfollowing me on social media, being quiet and shut down when I enter a room, ex-friends finding excuses to leave me out of plans and hang-outs, etc, etc. I understand to many, I have a strong personality, I have a bit of a potty mouth and my sense of humor is out there but never offensive and I don't let my jokes run wild around people I have just met who might not know better. These thoughts then extend to me feeling like the least favorite of every friend group or just overall an unimpressive and forgettable friend.

How do I let go of these thoughts and this pressure I put on myself to be as likable as possible to everyone I know? I always feel inadequate. I am new to stoicism and would like to put some stoic practices in my day-to-day but I am unsure of what the appropriate  response to all this is as I feel like me getting so wrapped up in my head isn't very ""stoic"".",Stoicism,1703298503.0,t3_18ovhbg,0.91,8

On being content with myself and wanting to improve as a person,"Hello!

Of course I know I have many vices. I can be very impulsive and feel like my emotions control me, although I know both have improved greatly since I have been exposed to stoicism. However, I struggle with my self image and loving myself knowing I have all those flaws.

Created a Self-Study Introductory Course on Stoicism,"I started reading “Daily Stoic” about a year ago, and really enjoy that is is mostly just quotes from original texts of the Stoic Philosophers. I do not really like Ryan Holiday or his anecdotes. Sometimes they are helpful for understanding the passage, but more often than not they seem pointless. So I wanted to read a mix here of modern stoic authors, while also reading some of the  primary texts. I used ChatGPT to come up with parts of this syllabus, but the texts and resources chosen are my own. Is this a good staring point?

Stoics Against Social Isolation,"I would like to discuss the stoic application of social interaction. This is in response to the frequent posts that go something like ""Due to x,y,z circumstances and events, I've decided that I'm never talking to anyone ever again, how can stoicism help me with the inevitable psychological consequences of my self-induced solitary confinement?""

I understand how someone could get an idea of the story of Seneca the Younger and him being wrongfully exiled, and I appreciate how well this story helps convey important tenants of stoicism, but I feel people run with the idea that stoicism = being alone. I also understand that Stoicism has been adopted by the ""sigma grindset"" side of social media that primarily values productivity and material success or status, which likely sends a lot of people here.

There is a concept of Oikiosis that's mostly discussed and referenced from the very early stoics like Cicero, but it's nonetheless important. My understanding of oikiosis is that it's the individual's natural instinct for self-preservation and care which extends outwards to friends and community, that helps develop an individual's moral compass. Moreover, the cardinal stoic virtue of justice does not only call for the fair treatment of others but also active contribution to the community, and this seems to be overlooked.

**In short,** if someone is dealing with a tragedy that has left them completely socially isolated, stoicism can help, but I believe, from my interpretation of the texts, that it's antithetical to stoicism to completely remove oneself from all communities. Thoughts?

**Some sources:**

""With the exception of wisdom, I'm inclined to believe that the immortal gods have given nothing better to humanity than friendship."" - Cicero

""No good thing is pleasant to possess, without friends to share it."" - Seneca

""Friendship produces between us a partnership in all our interests. There is no such thing as good or bad fortune for the individual; we live in common. And no one can live happily who has regard to himself alone and transforms everything into a question of his own utility; you must live for your neighbour, if you would live for yourself. "" - Seneca

""This is the first promise that philosophy holds out to us: fellow-feeling, humanity, sociability."" — Seneca

""Nature bore us related to one another … She instilled in us a mutual love and made us compatible … Let us hold everything in common; we stem from a common source. Our fellowship is very similar to an arch of stones, which would fall apart, if they did not reciprocally support each other"" - Seneca",Stoicism,1703274255.0,t3_18on6um,0.81,6
What are some good Stoic texts related to righteous indignation and not feeling anger and outrage when something doesn’t go my way?,"So I noticed I have this pattern where I get very angry when something doesn’t go my way. It feels like some great injustice has been done to me.

Rather than seeing it from a more objective perspective where it’s just a slight preference, that didn’t go my way, I get all bent out of shape and feel like it shouldn’t have gone that way, and things need to have gone differently, and I oftentimes get angry during these situations.

I’m looking for a way to change this behavior and be able to remain more levelheaded both in my behaviors outwardly, but also more importantly, in my inward feelings, as well.

I’m wondering if anyone has any stoic texts that they could recommend to me to help in this area?

How to stop hating somebody and be stoic?,"Had an ugly falling out with a ""friend"" about nine months ago.  (He accused me of doing something I didn't do, and refused to accept my explanation.)

My hatred of him was infinite for awhile, and thankfully it's gotten at least a little better in recent weeks.  But plenty of hatred remains.

What's still holding me back from letting go completely?  I still have to see this person every week, because he works at a restaurant my husband & I frequent.  Obviously we aren't going to boycott the restaurant over this, but I do look forward to the day that he no longer works there.

Of the people I've actually known, my list of folks I absolutely loathe isn't very long:  An ex-boss, my brother, and the devil incarnate kid who came up from behind me when I was six years old and shoved my head into a tire rim just because.  Fortunately I no longer have to see any of them, so they (mostly) stay out of mind because they're far out of sight.

But I still have some rage when I encounter the jerk at the restaurant.  I wish nothing but bad things for him -- which isn't stoic, and I'm not proud of it.  I think my continued anger stems from the fact that at the time of kerfuffle, I could have really let him have it and told him off.  I didn't, and now it's too late.

Maybe the fact that I didn't tell him off was a form of stoicism?  I don't know.  But I'm really curious how some of you get so stoic that you can 100% tune out someone you despise, when that person is sometimes just a few feet away from you.

"Successful reframing of ""negative"" emotional reactions.","Ive recently had a light bulb moment regarding negative emotional reactions. 

A year ago I became aware of the childhood emotional neglect I faced growing up. I was completely burnt out and was unable to function at the caliber I had become accustomed to and expected from myself. This lead me to discovering CPTSD, followed by Stoicism. I'm sure the emotional neglect contributed to my negative emotional reactions, so this might seem more obvious to some.

Over the last year I would seem to grasp the Stoic philosophy, taking control over my negative emotional reactions but then a particular hardship would come along and trigger me, and make my understanding and practice of Stoicism become muddled and confusing. 

If someone was taking advantage of me or if someone was criticizing me unfairly I would become upset. I would try to work through this by telling myself ""don't worry about things that are out of my control"", ""how I respond is what's important, not what someone does"", ""judge myself on how I'm acting, don't project my morals onto others"", ""be kind to them, they are not intending to be mean, they're just ignorant"". Etc etc. Despite reading and reminding myself of Stoic philosophy, after each challenging situation I would still be upset inside. I was still feeling upset by the actions of others. I didn't know how to truly believe something that I didnt like, wasn't a negative. I also felt complacent, as if I wasn't standing up for myself in these situations. I couldn't make it all come together neatly and calmly in my mind and my gut. 

But then it hit me. How I'm viewing the hardship/unfavorable action is all wrong. I had been trying to deflect my negative reactions by looking inward for comfort, when I should have been looking inward to change my perspective. 

Below I've outlined 2 examples of my reframing and what response it yields. 

""Someone is taking advantage of me"" becomes ""someone is doing something I don't like"". Instead of having a negative emotional reaction to being taken advantage of, I now have the option to simply and matter of fact-ly communicate my needs and expectations or remove myself from the situation. Saying I am being taken advantage of is a judgement/assumption I am making of their behaviour/intention, and it makes me a victim. That's a tough pill to swallow. It comes from my own expectations of how others should act, it comes from my ego. Removing the judgement statement makes it much easier for me to respond rationally. 

""Someone is judging/criticizing me"" becomes ""i dont agree with someone's opinion of me"". Again, instead of viewing myself negatively through their eyes, which causes me to become defensive, I am simply saying we disagree on the topic, that their truth isn't THE truth. I can either express my views in a virtuous manner, agree to disagree, or consider their perspective and aim to improve if needed. My internal dialog switched from labeling myself as the problem, to labeling the problem as the problem. 

I would love hear more ""negative emotional reactions/judgements = neutral statement replacement"" that others can think of!",Stoicism,1703199062.0,t3_18nzowk,0.99,18

Understanding my own meditations,"I am fairy new to Stoicism I have been trying to write out conversations I have in my head in order to better understand myself and my emotions. I'm hoping with my recent studies of Stoicism, I am able to apply the values into my thoughts. I'd love to hear any feedback or to add some Stoic wisdom to better relate to yourself.

Why am I such an emotionally sensitive individual?

It feels like I don’t know how to take anything as a joke anymore. I used to brush everything off and laugh about it, but now I don’t know how to respond. 

No one is truly joking about anything they say. There is always some sense of truth behind their words. 

\- But people do joke, you have just been accustomed to bullying.

“I don’t see much you bring to the table other than constant sensitivity”

\- See? Bully.

Why cant a man be emotional without being ridiculed? Humans are designed to have emotion, it’s what allows you to express your soul. Men are told to remain unobstructed by any of life's mishaps. 

\- Correct. You must still allow yourself to process your own emotional reactivity to the thoughts following a specific event. 

Yes; however, we are still ridiculed for our emotions. The insecurities of others leaks out of them as they bark at  you for being able to be honest and open with yourself and your emotions. 

\- Then leave them as they were. Their thoughts and emotions don't pertain to you.  ",Stoicism,1703212842.0,t3_18o4hab,0.99,1

does any one follow the message of stoics as to think before going through with your behaviour?,"I have been reading **Art of Living** an interpretation of Epictetus lesson by Sharon Lebell.

anyways in one of the lessons the author says that before doing any course of action i should think before doing it.

i think this is a great advice and for some it's common sense but does anyone do it? i'm not saying nobody does it i'm genuinely curious cause it seems like it's so time consuming because we make more 1000 decision a day and more than 1000 action so thinking before doing anything omg that would be soul killing.

that's my opinion i know my knowledge is limited and i'm here to learn i asked because i want to learn i'm young and foolish so be easy on me please.

ps: i'm asking because i want to understand this lesson better cause throught my whole life i always said and done stupid things especially (the problem of saying stupid things and doing them only occurs when i'm around my family and that makes me so sad idk why really i really love my family and respect them.) when i'm around my family, said things i regret saying and doing. so i think this lesson if done correctly and practiced could help make me a better person. and i don't know why i'm so foolish around my family. but it is what it is.

thank you all and i hope someone could help me through this.",Stoicism,1703200863.0,t3_18o0dik,0.57,1
Eternal Return and Free Will.,"Hi!
I found the concept of Eternal Return which was practiced by Stoics, especially the earliest ones. I have got a question. 
So, according to the theory of eternal return, time is cyclical, it repeats itself and according to some posts I've seen here, it all happens over again, the same way it was before, so I understood that if there is a Glad_Communications posting this today, there was another Glad_Communications in the past cycle and there will be another one in the future cycles. And as far as my studies in Stoicism work, then nature is deterministic, which means that there are things which will inevitably happen, but we have some degree of free will according to the knowledge we have and will have, so... in that way, isn't then determinism and eternal return mutually exclusive? Because nature then would then be pre-deterministic.",Stoicism,1703177066.0,t3_18nraab,0.67,2

Book 10 opening paragraph,"At the start of book 10 Marcus says this 

“My soul, will you ever be good, simple, individual, bare, brighter than the body that covers you? Will you ever taste the disposition to love and affection? Will you ever be complete and free of need, missing nothing, desiring nothing live or lifeless for the enjoyment of pleasure?”

Can someone explain this to me in a better way than I’m currently understanding it? It seems to me like there should be no enjoyment or emotion in life other than virtue. 

Epictetus also talks about if someone leaves or someone dies you should see it as returning them.

Loving Evil People," Reading The Meditations, Marcus Aurelius says that the height of all logic that all stoics should seek out is loving every last human being. I have been contemplating this for a few weeks but keep coming to a dead end... I have felt freed by loving those who are condescending or mean to me instead of stewing in my own damaged ego or pride. However, I don't understand how I can possibly love someone like Hitler or Leopold II or other people like them who are undoubtedly horrific monsters. I understand that people are a product of their environment, but at a certain point you are making a willing choice to continue down a path of moral corruption. I can have faith that people can change, but many people (like Hitler and Leopold) will never change. How and why is it important to love those who spread hatred and death?

I think I don't get It right, because If that is true I don't have to bother about anything? Like, I study engineering and there is no way you can finish this course without worrying or being anxious, in other words, it is unlikely that someone makes It to the end maintaining peace of mind.

My childhood haunts me.,"I never had the chance to meet my father. My mother was overprotective and kepr me from forming independence. I was bullied in school, graduated friendless, obese, with a bad posture, no marketable skills, destined for failure.

I've been focused on turning this story around, in every aspect, physical and financial especially. The way I deal with this all that happened is to not think about it, not talk about it, not mention it. People tell me should forgive the people who hurted me and my mother, I can't. I will be aknowledging that what they've done was okay and let them go out without consequence. I was the one everyone was stepping on for 18 years, I won't let this happen again.

I just got fired,"My life couldn’t get any more unfortunate lol.

I missed a shift a few weeks ago because of a technical error that didn’t notify me that I was scheduled for that day. My supervisor notified me of this and I assured her it wouldn’t happen again but there was literally no way I could have prevented this.

Fast foward to a couple weeks later and I’m scheduled for a shift that conflicts with my unavailability (another technical issue). On the day before my shift starts (2 hours in advance) I let my supervisor know that I won’t be able to attend because of a competition. She responds 4 hours later and because of competition rules, I can’t use my phone and respond to her in a timely manner. I see her message a few hours later asking me to come in late but I see that it’s past the time of the shift. Here’s where I know I messed up- I eventually end up not followingup with her as I believe it would be better just to leave things as is since I thought the situation was under control.

I message her a few days after that regarding a question and everything seems cool, no mention of any issues regarding the whole situation or anything like that. Then, I receive an email on Monday saying that I’m being terminated for my low availability (this was the topic of the question i messaged to her) and that I’ve had two no-shows with little communication.

I feel like I properly communicated for the first one and I see my mistake in the second but I just can’t help but feel a bit distraught. I genuinely thought everything was fine and it feels like a bomb has been dropped on me. All my friends work in an affiliate of this company and it’s kind of embarrassing if I have to tell them I got fired.

Dichotomy on Control as an argument about Identity,"Here is something I've been considering that I wanted to get the community's opinion on. I think that the dichotomy of control is better understood as an argument about **identity** (what we fundamentally are), than an argument about control, influence, or cause. 

The Handbook introduces the Dichotomy of control as follows: ""Some things are within our power, while others are not. Within our power are opinion, motivation, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever is of our own doing; not within our power are our body, our property, reputation, office, and, in a word, whatever is not of our own doing."" ( Handbook 1.1 Hard Translation).

Most people take this to mean that there are three things are play:

1. Us (who we are)
2. The things up to us (Opinion, motivation, desire)
3. The things not up to us (body, our property, reputation).

Instead, I think the argument is better thought of as this:   
1. There are the things that we ARE, that make up our identity (our opinions and desires).  
2. There are the things that we ARE NOT, that don't make up our identity (our body, our reputation).

Therefore, we should focus on improving and caring about what we fundamentally are. Our life goes better when WE are better (better opinions, better desires). Our life does not go worse when things WE ARE NOT get damaged (our office, our property). The DOC then is not about describing what we can or can't control, but about where the limits of our identity lie, which technically for Epictetus is our Prohairesis (our faculty of choice).

It is a change in the emphasis of the argument. Epictetus is not *just* saying that we suffer when we try to control what is outside our control (although that is true). He is emphasizing that we suffer when we identify ourselves with the things that are not up to us. When we think something belongs to us (is up to us) that doesn't.

This is why in Discourses 1.1 Epictetus focuses so much on personal identity. He presents an example with a tyrant: ""'Tell me your secrets.' I won't reveal them; for that lies within my power. 'Then I'll have you chained up.' What are you saying, man, chain *me* up? You can chain my leg, but not even Zeus can overcome my power of choice (prohairesis). 'I'll throw you into prison.' You mean my poor body.""

The humour in this passage is that the tyrant is trying to threaten Epictetus, but the tyrant is applying a non-Stoic perspective. He is threatening Epictetus' body, but Epictetus realizes that he is not his body and so he is not intimidated. He is his character, his prohairesis, his capacity to make choices. That is what applying the Dichotomy of control looks like in action, not just saying ""oh well, I can't control what you do."".

What do you think?

Stressed about money and future and status and happiness,"NOTE: I have ADHD and Crohn's, which I think influences why I feel this way. I'm posting here because I've found Stoicism helpful in the past and I think people here will have a unique perspective on this. 

&#x200B;

I naturally stay up late and wake up late. When I don't have external demands on me, I tend to sleep between 2am and 4am and wake up between 10am and 1pm. 

Obviously, when I was in school, I had to be there from 8-4 ish every day (well, excluding the large amount of days I skipped or left at lunch or showed up after lunch). I honestly can't remember how I did it. I think I was usually just groggy and annoyed for a few hours and then felt better as the day went on. 

After college, I tried to work various jobs that started in the morning, around 8 or 9. I quit all of them relatively quickly because I just hated getting up so early. I hated feeling rushed. I hated not having time to eat breakfast or have coffee or tea. I hated driving to work in rush hour traffic. 

After a couple years I went to Korea to teach in an afterschool English academy. My hours were 3pm-10pm ish. It was awesome. I'd get up, enjoy my morning, go for a hike or something, eat lunch, and head to class feeling good. My job was fun and I was good at it. Then I'd relax at night or walk around or whatever I wanted and just go to sleep when I felt tired. 

The problem is as I'm getting older I'm a bit stressed about money and the future and all that stuff. My job in Korea provided a free apartment, but the salary wasn't much. I could save a few hundred dollars a month if I tried. I came back to the US after 2 years with about 4 grand. 

I applied to a bunch of jobs in the US. The two interviews I got were car salesman (which sounded terrible and would have me working like 10 hours a day) and concessions at the movie theater (which I took and I'm enjoying, but obviously the money is very little). 

I've thought about ways I could make more money and I basically came up with 3 options. 

1) Do something online like writing or making videos or learning to code- This would be good because of flexibility, but it's hard to predict whether you will be successful. Also, I tend to get down if I don't socialize for awhile. I get energy from being around people and I don't know if I could be happy sitting in my room for 8 hours a day. 

2) Become a ""real"" teacher- This would require me to get a teaching license and/or masters degree. I could potentially end up working in international schools, which sounds cool. They also get paid a lot better than academy teachers. But from what I've heard, you generally have to spend 2 years teaching in the US or an undesirable country before you get a job somewhere I'd want to live. I really don't want to do that. And honestly, I don't want to go back to the school schedule, waking up at 6 or 7am. And I don't want to teach big classes, like 30-40 kids. The max at my old job was 12 and even that felt a bit much to me. 

3) Go to law school- I did well in debate, majored in philosophy, and got a good score on a practice LSAT. I think I have the skills to excel in this. But working as a lawyer requires a 9-5 type job (or worse if you want to make a lot of money). And also I think a lot of it will be boring and tedious and ethically grey, which I don't like. When I think about it, I did well in debate, but it also stressed me out a lot and I could get mad when judges were stupid or people were mean to me. 

&#x200B;

So, as you can see, I have no idea what to do next haha. I think two of the biggest things holding me back are not wanting to work a ""normal"" schedule or live in places I don't want to live in. To be honest, what I want to do is go back to working in an academy in Korea. I think I was the happiest I've ever been there and I miss it. But I'm scared of not making much money as I get older. 

I don't really care much about money myself. I really wish I didn't have to think about it. I kind of hate thinking about it. But it's important for security, in case of emergencies or what not. And I'm worried about my ability to date or get married as I get older if I don't start making more money. Most girls I dated in my 20's didn't seem to care, but will they if I'm in my 30s and still not making a lot? 

Anyone relate to this or have any advice? 

My dad wants me to go to law school and I think my mom wants me to get a masters in education, but I think I might end up hating either one. I want to go back to teaching in an academy, but I'm worried and feel I might be embarrassed to still be doing that in my 30s. I turn 30 in October.

Is this Stoicism?,"I read a book by the famous historical polymath ibn Hazm and something in my mind says its stoic.

He wrote:

""These words encapsulate all 
virtue: to control oneself against passion means in fact to turn 
away from one’s natural tendency towards anger and lust, 
things which are both under the dictates of passion. Then all 
that is left for the soul to use is the intellect which God has 
given it, the good sense which distinguishes it from the beasts, 
from insects or vermin and from tigers. “Never lose your 
temper,” as Allah’s Prophet (peace be upon him) said to a 120
man asking advice, and, as he also said commanding him, “Do 
as you would be done by” , together encapsulate the whole of 121
virtue


He further writes about the goal of all humans and all nations, 
“I have tried to find one goal which everyone would agree to be 
excellent and worthy of being striven after. I have found one 
only: to be free from anxiety. When I reflected upon it, I 
realized that not only do all agree in valuing it and desiring it, 
but I also perceived that, despite their many different passions 
and aspirations and preoccupations and desires, they never 
make the slightest gesture unless it is designed to drive anxiety 
far away. One man loses his way, another comes close to going 
wrong, finally another is successful - but he is a rare man, and 
success is rare, (O all-knowing Allah). Dispelling anxiety is a 
goal upon which all nations agree from the time when the 
Almighty created the world until the day when this world will 
pass away and be followed by the Day of Judgment - and their 
actions are directed to this goal alone. In the case of every 
other objective there will always be some people who do not 
desire it. For example, some people are not religious and do 
not take eternity into account. There are some who by nature 
and inclination prefer obscurity to fame [the obscurity of 
satisfied passion]. There are some who have no interest in 
amassing a fortune, preferring abstinence to ownership; this 
was the case with many of the Prophets. May peace be upon 
them all - and those who followed their example, ascetics and 
philosophers. There are some who by nature dislike sensual 
pleasures and scorn those who seek after them, such as those 
men we have just mentioned, and who prefer to lose a fortune 
rather than gain one. Some prefer ignorance to knowledge, in 
fact most of the people that you see in the street are like this. 
These are the objectives of people who have no other aim in 
life. Nobody in the whole world, from the time of its creation 
until its end, would deliberately choose anxiety, and would not 
desire to drive it far away. When I had arrived at this great 
piece of wisdom, when I had discovered this amazing secret, 
when Allah the Almighty had opened the eyes of my mind.


it should refrain from this passion, and the [Prophet’s] 
commandment to do as you would be done implies that the 
souls should turn away from the strong force of greed and lust 
and should uphold the authority or the means of justice which 
springs from the rationality which is part of the reasonable soul. 
I have seen the majority of people - except those who God the 
Almighty has protected, and they are few - throw themselves 
into the miseries, the worries and fatigues of this world, and 
pile up a mountain of sin which will mean that they enter 
hellfire in the Hereafter and will have no advantage from the 
perfidious intentions which they nurse so carefully, such as 
wishing for an inflation of prices which would bring disaster 
upon the children, the innocent, or wishing the worst trials 
upon those they hate. They know very well that these bad 
intentions will not necessarily bring about what they desire or 
guarantee its advent, and if they clarified and improved their 
intentions they would hasten the repose of their spirits. They 
would then have the time to devote themselves to their own 
business and would thus profit a great deal in addition to the 
return of their souls to God, and all this without having at all 
hastened or delayed the realization of their desires. Is there any 
worse deception than the attitude which we warn against here, 
and is there any greater happiness than the one which we are 
promoting?”122

How to avoid letting stoicism cause dismissiveness?,"“What can I do about my brothers anger?”

Nothing. You can do nothing about it. But you can control your response to his anger” I.e. don’t get angry just because he’s angry

This is true and it’s valuable to focus on not letting other people’s reactions cause you to react in a similar way

But at the same time, this feels pretty black and white. Maybe you can help your brother with his anger by asking what’s going on to cause it, maybe you did something that understandably contributed to his anger, and it’s unfair for you to say “hm his anger is his own problem, nothing I can do”.

I feel guilty and scared of my emotional responses,"Yesterday I had what started as a funny argument on a random topic. My sister and my husband had an opposite view as mine and both of them where interrupting me while I was trying to speak. I said “Shut the fuck up” which was meant in a jokingly way but my face showed my frustration of being repeatedly interrupted. They both said wow that’s not cool and I apologised on the spot. My sister got really triggered and threw in my face that I cry when someone tells me something that hurts my feelings but I say things like that when I am angry. Also I confess that lately I feel very emotional when I see my sister and my husband “coming together “ against me.

The point is that she has a point. I am a very sensitive person, I get emotional very easily and I just want to stop reacting. I feel like I always says something wrong and I feel terrible and insecure afterwards. I feel like I am a bad person for having these reactions. It looks like everyone can be cool and easy going but me, like I am always making mistakes and that the people I love will get tired of me.

Should I avoid confrontation? How can I be a better, wiser person? How do I deal with my insecurities?

I have a really hard time either processing emotions or understanding them. I messed up yesterday and freaked out, all because I felt like an idiot because I kept pushing a place to go for vacation that people couldn't afford. Was not upset about that at all, more so because I was embarrassed and feel bad they didn't tell me and told my brother. It doesn't even make sense. I'm trying to figure out why I get like this.

What should a stoic define as true power?,"I'm in a career which gives me a lot of responsibility and authority but it tends to become fairly political. Due to this, mentors and advisors frequently recommend books like The Prince or the 48 Laws of Power. However, these books don't align with the values of a stoic and are ruthlessly pragmatic. I'm not sure how to incorporate the understanding I have gathered from these while maintaining my character.
The question I want to explore is how should I view power as a stoic, especially when the choices I make effect the lives of others. I literally hold people's lives in my hands due to my career, so do I owe it to them to be as ruthlessly pragmatic as possible?
Do I play the game and behave disingenuously, even if it goes again the principles of Stoicism?",Stoicism,1703041770.0,t3_18mkciy,0.86,10
How would stoics view modernity?,"
Modern day hook up culture plaguing the youth, wide spread availability of drugs, instant pleasure at our finger tips, no real commitments to anything, hyper active behavior everywhere, no real search for meaning, feminization of men, wide spread obesity, being a father or mother is seen as a ""waste"", lust and greed driven, etc...

I could go on with hundreds more but you clearly get the picture.

Before you say, ""that's a minority group and your spending to much time on social media...🤓"" I agree it is a minority, however, I lump it all together to create what I would consider a small majority group, or at least maybe that's where it's heading.

I dont really consume any social media and I'm not some old guy behind the times. I'm really young and I just like philosiphy.

So back to the question:

How would stoics, like Marcus Aurelius or Seneca, view our society today? Is it much different than theirs at the time? Also, what would they say to us in regards to how we should live, or what we can do to change?

Talk only when needed?,"After countless conversations I had with people, I am thinking about not getting involved in conversations.

Whenever I try to have a conversation, I try to be as close to reality as possible, instead of having my opinions or my conditioning. People most often take it offensive and project their hatred towards me.

Some people try to shut me off by saying I sound like a philosopher. Some people appreciate it though. 

It feels exhausting. I start to question why do I even have these conversations in the first place.

People often can't really accept reality. I don't know every truth ever. But I can perceive it to some extent.

To me a conversation is about exchange of information to learn and grow. There is some amount of egoic identity involved as well personally. I am not going to deny it. Still learning to not take it personally when I am defeated and trying to learn from it. 

I right now feel like I only need to talk when there is something gonna change if I contribute to the conversation. If things are not going to change, then why even take part in the conversation? 

If both the parties learn and grow, then it's fine. Or else observation and silence is better I guess.

Preparation for starvation," This may seem somewhat  pessimistic, but after deep consideration I realize this is a more likely issue I'm going to face in the future. Currently my families financial situation is mid at the moment. There's me, my mom and my grandfather. Truth be told we're solely dependent on my grandfather's pension. My mother is a housewife with only a high-school diploma. I passed my graduation and I have been trying for job for 6 years but to no hope whatsoever in the horizon. I did a lot of odd jobs and with recession in the country lost the current job I have. I'm have been trying for quite some time but it's to no avail. We have been rationing a lot of our food, but with grandfather's advance age and all and his medical bills, it seems it not enough. He's well psst 90 and he's have a lot of co morbidity. If he dies we can manage for a while but after a year or so we'll be dead broke. To prepare myself for that likely future I have been trying to prepare myself for stark starvation by eating a meal a day. Sometimes even no meals. I have been doing it for quite a few months now.

"Loved Meditations, STRUGGLING with Discourses","I read the Hayes translations of Meditations and loved it.  I then went to the Haward Morse audiobook of Discourses (Gregory Long translation.)  I'm STRUGGLING, with entire sentences, paragraphs passing by with little comprehension. The heavy English accent and old translation, combined with the fact that I consume these as audiobooks while doing long distance running, has me wondering if I'm wasting my time (7.5 more hours to go).

I'm trying to decide do I:

1. Quit, start over with a new translation and narrator, or
2. Suffer through it, or
3. Quit entirely and instead read a modern distillation of Stoicism (""The Daily Stoic"" or other)?

Observation from Beyond Good and Evil regarding criticism of Stoicism,"I am working my way through Beyond Good and Evil for the first time. In book two, Nietzsche goes on a tirade against a few different philosophies - including Stoicism. In it, he mocked the Stoics for wanting to live in accord with nature and basically said the Stoics imprint their own morality onto nature this way and that nature is ultimately indifferent. 

Then, later in book III he is talking about religious people and specifically about Christianity in Europe. In this section he says:

“Then, during the moral epoch of mankind, one sacrificed to one’s God one’s own strongest instincts, one’s “nature“: this festive joy lights up the cruel eyes of the aesthetic, the “anti-natural” enthusiast.”


Seems to me like this definition of nature that he claims is being sacrificed is rather close to the Stoic idea of acting within one’s own nature. To “live according to one’s nature” as I understand it (correct me if I am wrong) means, broadly for humans, living in according with what makes humans unique - their ability to reason. 


Does it seem like his argument about sacrificing one’s nature seems to go against the argument he made against stoicism? In my reading it seems like he miss-characterized what “nature” is in the stoic context and then, albeit loosely, admitted to the existence of “nature” in the form the stoics use by conceding some people do sacrifice their nature.

I could be reading too much into it, any thoughts from someone more versed in Nietzsche and Stoic thought?",Stoicism,1702945878.0,t3_18locod,0.67,3
Explaining Mortality and Death To Small Kids,"Curious to get some perspective. 

My five year old son will make a wish blowing out a birthday candle or something and I always tell him I hope all his wishes come true.  The other day he said, he has a wish that he know won't come true and then whispered ""I don't want to die"".  He then said he also doesn't want me or other family members to die.  

It's odd how over the past several years studying stoicism I've just fallen into the habit of contemplating my mortality and that of my loved ones on a near daily basis.  This might sound incredibly depressing to some, but it's really not.  Rather I see it as just being aware of how nature works and it also gives perspective into what I think is important to do with the present moment.  It's also amazing how this habit has cleared up some fears and self-doubt, but I digress.  

I've gotten into the habit of thinking before I speak.  I think it's a good habit, otherwise I might have said something like: ""you're right, we're all going to die eventually and that's just how things work but try to not let it bother you"" or some other thing that probably wouldn't really be beneficial for either of us.  Instead I just said ""it's important to focus on the time we have right now and enjoy the present moment of being here with each other"" and gave him a big hug.  

I feel like I somewhat avoided the question and have been thinking of other ways that I could respond, so appreciate any other perspectives.  

Thanks!

"I need good advice from some stoic men, because i dont know what will happen to me now, im getting death threats in highschool","So around two weeks ago, my life was going well, my self esteem was rising from a shit 2022, and i thought i was out of the ringer. Then all that hope was thrashed into peices. bassically this kid that i was sort of friends with made this rumor about me saying that i leaked his home adress. This was a blow as i thought this kid was my friend. Then my popualarity and reputation that i once had crumbled. I thought this was the deepest pit of hell a man can face, all his friends who he realises are fake leaving him, although it got worse, so much more worse. Then he added  me to this group chat on snapchat and got this kid to threaten me and press me, no matter how much i tried to explain they would not understamd the truth. They forced me to confess to somthing i did not do under the threat of a beating. And i thought that that was it, it got worse, this was probably the first time i experienced real trauma, and im only a highschooler. They added me to another chat with 15 other kids, who were all gang affiliated although in highschool and they threatened me, harrased me and even said they would stab me. Those thoughts keep me up at night. Anyways i kept this all to myself, my pearents did not need added stress, and i was forced to pay these people 20$ to let me live. It got worse, the next weekend i had a family gathering, in wich took my mind of taht trauma, on monday i checked my snapchat, apparently over the weekend i was placed in another groupchat with even more kids, giving more death threats to me. the things they said made my shiver, i gave one $20 now they all wanted up to 50$ saying they wanted a new vape or a new knife. But when they did not get a response from me as i was busy with the gathering and hanging out with my cousins. They moved on to 3 other kids, pressing them, death threating them, they sent images of their guns and knives and vapes to them, and even took $50 from them. I could not let this slide, i had to make sure this would nto happen again, i got another phone and recorded the whole conversation,this way they would not know i collected this. That should atleast send them to juvie right? But i wanna tell the authorities in a way that would not let them know that i was the snitch, cos if they find out man then idk what will happen... anyways its been 3 weeks, school break has started,i deleted my snap account and blocked them all, i only have my family and becaus of erliar events no friends to spend the break with.

I can’t cry anymore.,"Hi everyone,

I am on my stoicism journey since one and a half year. I love the idea of controlling myself, my thoughts, my emotions & my actions. Sometimes I am driven by external circumstances, but I think that I am making a great progress in quickly realising what is under my control and what is not.

The reason:
Since 2 months I am experiencing a downfall of my relationship. I know my faults, I know what I did wrong, and I am taking a full responsibility of changing those things. Simply saing - my fault is that I was controlling. 

But everything seems that there is nothing left to save - my woman is extremely passive-agressive towards me, almost to the point that I question my own humanity. She makes me feel like a monster. Someone that is not worth fighting for.

I live in a constant state of alert, wondering when the day of saying goodbye comes. One day everything seems fine, and the second day she strikes me right in my heart. And yet, I don’t feel sad. I don’t know how to blame her for being shitty because I know her behaviour is not under my control. At the same time I can’t stop loving her, because I see those good days we have had.

She might be doing this to break me & make me pull the trigger first, so I will be a „bad” one in this relationship. The one that decided to left. Or she might be testing me if I am all into really changing my behaviour.

The question:
The thing that bothers me the most is that I used to be a very emotional man, but I can’t dive into my feelings anymore. I used to cry when I was upset or sad, but I can’t do it anymore. I just can’t. And I know everything would be much easier for me if I could. 

Can it be an early stage of depression? What the #%@! should I do? What the virtuous, spiritual man would do being in my place? I know some things, but I definitely don’t know what to do in that exact situation. God, please, give me strength & courage to do the right thing.",Stoicism,1702941541.0,t3_18lmq9q,0.74,2

>The only solution to cognitive dissonance is to change your actions. Sure, you can change your beliefs (opinions) about cigarettes to ""oh, I'm young, I'll worry about my lungs later,"" but this will keep you stuck in smoking because you can't change a habit without changing the belief surrounding it. 

Id like to discuss this specific part further. For this given example, in the end clinically smoking is bad for humans. The resolutions given when boiled down were change thoughts or change actions.

In a different case: Maybe someone percieves that their work environment is rather hostile to them. When in reality, everyone thinks they're mediocre at worst. They could change their actions in the form of a job change, or change the way they perceive the work environment.

Point being, if one decides to change something, how do they decide on how to change? Maybe this dips a little too far into the ""Stoicism is not a replacement for therapy"", maybe I'm getting too far into the weeds of it and it really is as simple as ""it depends""

But matters are not so well with him, but altogether well with you, that it should be in his power for you to be not disturbed.""

Does being virtuous becomes easier and easier the more virtuous you become?,"Today I was thinking about why I had no will to do what I'm supposed to do(study some engineering concepts), my mind keeps creating like mechanisms for me to think ""why would I suffer studying, maybe I am having a burnout?(lol)"" and then, when the end of the day comes and I did nothing, I feel like shit. Like, if virtue is the only true source of happiness then why is it so hard to act virtuously. Then I came across a possible explanation: The starting of becoming virtuous is extra hard, because of the vices you already have, the thoughts and opinions you already formed, and that's why the start is so painful. But when you're in this journey for more time it becomes easier to act virtuously. Is this right? Or will it be hard like this forever?

How do I behave around people I have disappointed (including myself)?,"Few months ago, a girl I was dating suddenly broke up with me without much of closure (we had some communication problems and her being younger, she was in a different life stage). Unfortunately, going to the same band, which I was not willing to give up after 8 years of playing, I had to see her quite regularly. Even still, recently, I have finally started to move on. Then, three days ago, we were at the same party with our band and I got blackout drunk (although this kind of behaviour is not usual for me). 

Afterwards, I found out directly from her that I wanted to talk with her about us, although she did not, and that I behaved like a condescending jerk. She did not want to elaborate further, simply stating 'drunk men's words are sober man's thoughts', so I don't know my behaviour specificaly (and I really fear it could have been even worse). Of course I apologized and promised it won't happen again, giving myself a word I will further limit my occasional alcohol consumption. However, I have never thought I could behave like this and feel that I have deeply let myself down. Furthermore, I hate that seomeone will judge me based on my drunk actions and today, I have to see the whole band again and I am so ashamed of myself I don't even know how to behave.",Stoicism,1702896007.0,t3_18l5rnm,0.4,0
Senecas missing letters?,Just began reading senecas letters to a stoic and I noticed it literally starts on letter 2.

Self-mastery over the festive season,"How can one incorporate Stoic principles to develop and maintain self-control and decisiveness, particularly in the face of social pressures during the holiday season when there's often an expectation to indulge in excesses like eating, drinking, and partying?

How to deal with expectations of recognition for doing the right thing?,"I've been interested in stoicism for a few years, and although I wouldn't say I'm an avid student of it, I do try to implement the stoic virtues and practices in my life.

By doing this, I find that often I choose the path of righteousness, of forgiveness, and seldom do I seek revenge or do evil.

My problem, however, is that I keep expecting recognition for doing such things. I feel like I deserve congratulations for making the rigth choices and doing the right acts. And I realize this corrupts my initial intentions as a whole. To the point where I can't tell when I'm doing good because I am virtuous and when I'm doing it to be percieved as good and mature.

To give you an example, I recently ended a friends with benefits kind of relationship, and this person is now dating my best friend. Note that I told my friend beforehand that if he was interested in her, I wouldn't be a problem and he could go for it. I had also told her during our arrangement that if she was interested in him, it would be okay, and she could just tell me and we'd end our relationship for the sake of theirs (because I didn't want a commitment with her, and they both wanted it).

She did not tell me she was interested, but she showed clear signs. She was quite disrespectful and hurtful to me a few times due to her inability to perceive and communicate her feelings. And I just did what was best for me and ended things between us.

And now, all I can fathom is that I made their relationship possible, and I feel like both her and my friend should thank me for it.

How do I get rid of this expectation? I've been reading Meditations but to no avail thus far.

A visualization/realization I've been having,"I thought I would share this in hopes sometime else has success with it.

I've studied Taoism in the past, and although I find it really similar to Stoicism, they go about things so differently.  Taoism seems to focus on truly accepting the things we can't change, while stoicism focuses on making the changes we with what we have.

With Taoism, I would do meditations where I imagined having an energy/chi inside me providing me with stability and warmth.  It's been very relaxing and calming to do this, especially while anxious.  So I decided to see how I could apply this to Stoicism.

When I think about what I can really change, it comes down to literally moving my hands, getting up, etc. way more than making money out something abstract as that.  So with that, I've been imagining the same ball of energy I used to keep on the inside, but just barely outside of me.  The gravity of it almost pulls me to motion and helps me see I am in control of myself completely and not ""stuck to the couch"" or whatever.

As a last note, these are purely meditations and figments of the imagination.  I see visualisation of my chi as similar to a *dogmata* or *mantra*, not something real or tangible.",Stoicism,1702876503.0,t3_18l0zkb,0.6,1

"A question about Risk, its worthiness and untimely death","Hello, 
I've been thinking of taking up some activities ( motorcycling, horse riding , a career that's risky in terms of mortality) that are sort of risky but am afraid of doing them for fear of injury or worse.

All my life I've erred on the side of caution, taking only calculated risks where the risks seems worthy enough, if the possibility of danger was even nominal I'd back off ( for example, i recently decided not to do river rafting). I am not lacking in courage but feel it best only to take risks that are ""worth it"".

Now I've been through some of the writings of George RR Martin and while its fiction in it a good number of characters -- good and bad die in the both unexpected and gruesome ways never fulfilling their destiny or their potential for great and noble things.

It also reminded me of Alexander The Great who wanted to conquer the world but died of Malaria, the second of the Mughal conquerers Humayan who died -- by falling from stairs in a library! 

The last great Hindu king who came from nothing but died from a single stray arrow hitting the only small single gap in his armor, Christopher reeves who fell from horseback and got paralyzed..any many other examples.

It makes me feel its better to stick to only necessary things. 

Why take these risks (motorcycling, horse riding) at all? I can make go through it for the career

This makes me afraid, what if i take any of these risks and get scared injured or die ...never even beginning to have fulfilled my duties or potential? 

P.S. I understand about the dichotomy of control and am not scared of death as a concept ( Death smiles at all men...all a man can do is smile back)..but the timing and worthiness of it",Stoicism,1702818583.0,t3_18kh0t8,0.78,5

"Not sure what the point of this post is, maybe just to get things off my mind."," 

Im a 20-year-old guy who recently wrapped up my gap year with a lot of hard work. Despite earning good money, I didn't save any. I spent it on a car and started but never finished my driving license. Now, the car sits unused, and another insurance payment is coming up.

Most of my earnings went into partying and, unfortunately, drugs. Thankfully, I've kicked that habit and don't feel the urge anymore—except when I drink, which is rare now. I've started university but missed three months of classes. I want to contact university about my situation but im scared they will kick me out for not doing any work at all. I like my course and the topics, but I can't bring myself to engage. I label myself as lazy, but when I attempt something, I can't seem to enjoy it.

While I hesitate to say I'm depressed, I feel lost. I enjoy life, people, even the ""bad"" ones, but I struggle to like myself or work on self-improvement. I have a wonderful girlfriend, and I know I'm smart, but when things start improving, I feel out of place, and they take a downturn again.

Two years ago, I lost my dad to alcohol, went through a breakup, and lost a friend, all in one year. Looking back, that seems to be when things started spiraling, and im not looking for an excuse, i cannot control that. 

I often compare myself to my successful sister, measuring my worth by materialistic standards, despite knowing it's not a healthy approach.

Today, my MacBook screen broke, adding to my stress as repairs will strain my already dead budget, but life continues with or with out. I'm not sure if this post even makes sense, but I felt the need to write and seek constructive criticism or just an understanding ear. It's strange—I know what I need to do, but I'm just not doing it. I'm trying, but it's all so confusing. This may sound like a cry for help, and I'm aware of that. I appreciate stoicism and the people here, and I just wanted to unload my thoughts.

If most of this doesnt make sense, dont worry, it doesnt in my head also.

Stoic View on Entertainment,"I recently watched All Quiet on the Western Front and enjoyed it.  I didn’t spend time analyzing my judgments about the movie while it’s happening as that would distract me from the plot. I just let my emotions run without questioning them. 

While watching movies I allow myself to get emotionally invested in the characters and the overall narrative for the duration of the film. A large part of the enjoyment I get out of reading fiction is from getting caught up in narrative, and viewing the world through the characters perspectives. These characters are usually flawed in some ways of course and are going to have errors in their reasoning.  Similarly, a large part of watching live sports is rooting for a team. 

Would a stoic forgo these aspects of entertainment for the sake of virtue?  If so, do those of you strictly practicing stoicism miss these pastimes?

How do those of you currently practicing stoicism regard movies, novels, and similar entertainment?

A unique and frustrating relationship (need good stoic advice),"Hey everyone. I consider myself an amateur stoic; have read Aurelius and Seneca and am currently reading Epictetus. 

A little background: So I had a 5+ year relationship that ended late 2021. We ended up remaining best friends to this day. Since then, I wanted to get back with her, but have tabled it due to her wanted to work on herself and heal some personal trauma(due to school and family deaths). Throughout the process, I have really tried to be patient, but the past 6 months or so I have been losing my patience with the situation.

The real issue: I am fine with the whole “single” dynamic and letting her heal on her own. However, I do have personal sexual needs that are not being met (I have high sex drive). The last time we had sex was Jan 2022. We live together in seperate rooms but still kiss and maintain a closeness. I have tried to work with her and be patient and understanding but there have been so many times where something can happen and she pulls away. At this point, seeing how much I am hurting, she has told me to look elsewhere to get what I need. The problem with this is that I am devoted to her and am not looking for sex in that kind of way. I am at my breaking point. It not like I am addicted or am falling prey to my desires, as I have done without for past 2 years. But I also want to experience fun and life. 

Stoicism has definitely helped me maintain the past year. But the lack of any progress coupled with my inability to move on is shaking me. Reading Seneca and how he talks about time makes this situation feel all the more urgent to me…

Stoicism for Action,"These are four principles I've written up for myself regarding Stoic action, expressing my view that Stoicism demands service to others in order to live in accordance with nature. 

I've followed each with a personal description and some of my favorite quotes regarding the matter, and included some various links to relevant articles (I <3 Donald Robertson). This is not meant to be a comprehensive defense of that view but sharing my personal reflections on it. 

&#x200B;

1. [The Common Good](https://modernstoicism.com/perspectives-the-stoics-on-the-community-of-humankind/) —> All our aims and actions should be directed towards benefitting the common good, as is in line with natural conduct and the path of virtuous action. We are temperate and courageous so we may [advocate for justice](https://www.orionphilosophy.com/stoic-blog/the-stoic-virtue-of-justice), not for tranquility or our own happiness.
   1. The pursuit of virtue, of justice among people, is that of virtuous action. To act with love, kindness, and compassion towards all others as one humanity; to engage, not withdraw, from public involvement.
   2. *“Born for society, \[the Stoics\] all believed it was their destiny to labor for it; with so much the less fatigue, their rewards were all inside themselves. Happy by their philosophy alone, it seemed as if only the happiness of others could increase theirs.”* (Montesquieu, The Spirit of Laws, 1748)
   3. *“Revere the gods, and look after each other. Life is short — the fruit of this life is a good character and acts for the common good.”* (Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations*, 6.30)
   4. *""The primary mission of the Stoics, in other words, is to be helpful to others and serve the greater good, and they don't do this to make themselves happy. They do it becaues it is the right and natural way to live. But doing it in that spirit, as it turns out, makes them happy.""* (Ward Farnsworth, *The Practicing Stoic*, 208)
   5. *""\[Happiness is found indirectly in the pursuit of other things, which as\] proposed by the Stoic consists primarily of a dedication to reason and a commitment to others -- to service, to justice, to helping in the ways one can.""* (Ward Farnsworth, *The Practicing Stoic*, 209)  

2. [**The Reserve Clause**](https://donaldrobertson.name/2013/02/02/action-with-a-reserve-clause-in-marcus-aurelius/) —> Engaging with the world of indifferents, we must act with detachment: We shall do our utmost to serve the common good, “Fate permitting.”
   1. To succeed or to fail does not make us virtuous. To act energetically in the name of good intentions is all we have the choice of doing. With a reserve clause, a life of pursuing and falling short of justice is still the noblest path.
   2. *“Try persuasion first, but even though men would say to you not to, act when the principles of justice direct you to. If anyone one should obstruct you by force, take refuge in being contented and without emotional pain, and use the obstacle for the display of some other virtue. Remember that the impulse you had was with an “reserve clause”, and your aim was not to do the impossible.”* (*Meditations*, 6.50)
   3. *“Though a man may in some sort hinder my activity, yet on my own voluntary impulses and mental attitude no fetters can be put because of the “reserve clause” and their ability to adapt to circumstances. For everything that stands in the way of its activity is adapted and transmuted by the mind into furtherance of it, and that which is a check on this action is converted into a help to it, and that which is a hindrance in our path goes but to make it easier.”* (*Meditations*, 5.20)  

3. [**Virtue in**](https://donaldrobertson.name/2018/05/15/the-stoic-socrates-four-emotional-resilience-strategies/) **& through Adversity** —> The world provides us with challenges so that we may test ourselves, become more virtuous and capable, and learn to find the value in all that may happen. We have virtues to face challenges; by facing challenges, we become virtuous. 
   1. We are to recognize and love the necessity of obstacles; appreciate our natural ability to confront and overcome it; seek the chance to prove and train ourselves, and find the humor and purpose granted by reversals.
   2. [Life as a “ball game”:](https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/stoicism-as-a-ball-game/) We seek to play with care and respect for other players, acknowledge their efforts to defeat us with calm, and exert ourselves fully with skill *and* neutrality towards the outcome.  A challenge to play well, not flip out. (1)
   3. *“Good men work, spend and are spent, and they do so willingly. Fortune does not drag them; they follow, and keep step.”* (Seneca, On Providence 5.4)
   4. *“This is no misfortune,; to bear it nobly, rather, is good fortune.”* (*Meditations* 4.49)
   5. “*And yet life, Lucilius, is really a battle. For this reason those who are tossed about at sea, who proceed uphill and downhill over toilsome crags and heights, who go on campaigns that bring the greatest danger, are heroes and front-rank fighters; but persons who live in rotten luxury and ease while others toil, are mere turtle-doves safe only because men despise them.”* (Seneca, *Moral Letters to Lucilius*, 96)  

4. [Stoic Joy](https://donaldrobertson.substack.com/p/three-sources-of-happiness-in-stoicism) —> It is in the activities of virtuous pursuit that we find cause to be joyful regarding our own virtue, the virtues of others, and joy in our lot in the world.
   1. We need not suppress our disappointments and frustrations, but rather recognize that they do not undermine the importance of virtuous action. With detachment and present-mindedness, they are easily endurable. 
   2. To the Stoic, virtue alone is sufficient for happiness under any circumstances. It is a rewarding experience to serve others, and enjoy exercising our ability to do so. We may find pleasure in acting out our natural function. 
   3. *“A man when he has done a good act, does not call out for others to come and see, but he goes on to another act, as a vine goes on to produce again the grapes in season.”* (Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations* 5.6)
   4. *""...Happiness is not supposed to be the Stoic goal, not even covertly. The Stoic view, rather, is that one should embrace virtue for its own sake, and that doing so is necessary to get the good side effects of it.""* (Ward Farnsworth, *The Practicing Stoic*, 209)  
 

Thanks for reading! Happy to discuss in the comments as usefully as I am able (fate permitting ;). 

Also, if you have any good articles on how challenges *develop* virtue, please share them and I'll add them to this post -- it seems like a major theme for [Seneca](https://www.stoicinsights.com/senecas-death-and-the-transformation-of-adversity/) and [Epictetus](https://academyofideas.com/2019/02/psychology-of-resilience/) to my mind, but most articles I found focused on philosophical coping mechanisms rather than Stoic virtue creation.

I haven’t been the perfect partner for her, but I supported her through many trials, made sacrifices for the relationship, etc. Obviously given how she left me for someone else and wasn’t very kind or caring towards me through the break-up process. Regardless of how much I understand how it’s irrational to expect her to treat me more “fairly” and be more grateful for the things I did and sacrificed for her throughout our relationship, deep down I can’t help but do expect it from her and be upset that she did not. Of course this is just one example, as since getting more into stoicism I noticed how much I expect from people and the world and how much energy and words I waste being upset at things/people not turning out how I would want them to. I tell myself and the rational “part” of my brain understands that it’s foolish to wish for a fig in winter. But deeper inside my soul I still cry out for the fig. I’m not sure how stoics are able to rewire themselves to stop wishing for it. Are there exercises for this specifically?

Any help would be appreciated, thank you.",Stoicism,1702718739.0,t3_18jnmtf,0.91,9

How Would a Stoic Deal With a Conservative Religious Family?,"Hi all, I'm a 21 Y.O. living in the UK.  


Roughly 3 years ago, I accepted to myself that I am no longer a Muslim, but rather an agnostic. I kept this hidden from my family, even when they knew that I had a lot of doubts and questions concerning Islam. They demand that I pray all 5 of my daily prayers with them, that I attend religious classes and that I cut ties with any non-religious friends that I may have.  


Fast-forward to today. I have a decent paying job, I have a tenancy agreement for an apartment that I can move into within the next month, and there's a lot of tension that's hard to avoid between my family and I. I believe that moving out will help in raising my self-esteem and my ability to be honest with my parents. They're worried that I'll condemn myself to hell if I don't work on increasing my knowledge when it comes to Islam, and that me considering moving out is a sign that I'm looking to part ways with my family. I've tried to ease their worries by telling them that I'd visit every weekend or so and that my main reason for moving out is to commute into work easier, but all I'm met with are tears, scoldings and guilt-tripping. 

Their actions are understandable. I've told them that I still share their faith, even if I have tons of doubts. They believe that the doubts will only go away once I've submitted myself to god and worked on gaining knowledge in Islam. But the truth is, I have no intention of exploring Islam. I don't want to live the double-life wherein I pretend to be someone I'm not around my family. I understand that telling my family that I'm no longer Muslim could lead to shunning and disownment , but I recognize that this is something I'll have to do. 

I'm feeling a lot of pressure from my siblings, which i find incredibly troubling to deal with. I'm not sure how I can deal with the accusations that I'm causing my parents a lot of suffering, and that It's within my best interests to work on fulfilling their criteria (spending more time with family, going to prayers more often, etc) before moving out. What I haven't told them is that the stress of having to put up a facade around them has lead to me isolating myself from the family. My siblings hold me responsible for my parent's sadness, and that I should forget about the tenancy agreement for the apartment and never bring it up with my parents again.

I'm unsure of what to do next. Part of me believes that I should notify my parents that I've signed the tenancy agreement, move out and then work on telling my family that I'm agnostic. Part of me sees that me bringing it up would only cause pain and more tension, so therefore I shouldn't tell them and I should work on moving out without them noticing.  


What would your stoic tips be for dealing with a situation like this? Would it be acceptable for me to lie about not signing the tenancy agreement to avoid conflict? 

*(TL;DR: Left Islam. Now living a double-life around family. Unsure if I should tell my family that I've decided to move out)*

On Anger,"We all get angry, and stoics would argue that it's how we control that emotion is the important part. But I read this quote and it hit me as a connection I had never made before: ""Anger is an emotional response to an unfulfilled expectation."" I realized how true that was - that when I felt anger it was because something was not happening the way I felt it should.

However this then begged the question: ""So do we then not have any expectations, if we don't want to feel anger?"" Not very realistic, and nihilistic really, which I don't think is any real way to live, but! If you have 0 expectations for anyone or anything then you no longer deal with anger.

So then is it better to temper expectations AND control the emotion of anger?

But if the goal is to \*feel\* less anger; then simply controlling it, isn't really the answer either. I apologize for my rambling - I'm just trying to write down what has been rolling around in my head for the last little bit.

How stoics deals with racism?,"I come from oppressed community in India, we are untouchables or Dalits, we're still treated like trash in my country. I want to do good things for the people not just for mine but for everyone. But the criticism and everything stops me and makes me anxious.

Although I haven't experienced discrimination directly. But I read it online about growing violence against our community. I have experienced it indirectly a lot. I tried to be best for my whole life and I succeeded in that too, I topped my school and college. People say that I am mediocre Dalit and that whatever I get is because of reservations (which is a special law for giving equal opportunity for oppressed communities, by allowing equal representation of people in education and other areas, like affirmative action). Think of Jews living in ghettos during ww2 Germany (I don't mean to offend anyone nor I am associating with worst tragedy in history, it's just the growing violence scares me and I can resonate with that event). Because of this and reading about violence, I hardly talk to anyone because I am scared to be out in public. I stopped going out for dates and asking out many years ago, cuz I am afraid that it will end badly and no one wants to get married and associated with a ""Dalit"". I am too scared of achieving my goals because everything in India is based on casteism, I may not find a house on rent because my caste. It's just bad here.

I used to lie in school about my caste.

Even though it happened it hasn't turned me into a bitter person. I respect every individual and empathize with others. I control my anger nor do I argue with someone who calls me names or makes fun of my community and call us scums. It's just that I am scared to do anything. Because if I achieve something in life I will be known as ""Dalit boy who... achieved something"" not a ""College boy who... achieved something"" or ""Engineering student who... achieved something""

If I have to do something I have to stay in limits because that may exploit my caste and people will bash my family for this reason.

Stoicism as an ever evolving philosophy,"In my mind, stoicism must evolve and change with the times to remain relevant. Marcus Aurelius, one of the most quoted and beloved stoic thinkers would most likely not fit the mold of how we think of stoics today. Despite being a man that pursued virtue as the highest importance he owned slaves. Would owning a slave today fit our judgment of what it means to be Just, one of the touchstones of stoic philosophy? I certainly hope not! People are a product of their time and their experiences. Times change and our notion of what it means to be just, temperate, wise and courageous must change with them.",Stoicism,1702626242.0,t3_18iuv7w,0.79,8
Marcus Aurelius teaches to not complain; I kinda disagree.,"The quote goes ""Don't be overhead complaining... not even to yourself"" -Marcus Aurelius, 8.9.  

Complaining is all about emotional expression. when an emotion is dominating your mind it becomes easy to become hopeless, and feel like you cannot fix the problem. When you vent out this emotion (complaining is an easy way to do that), it allows your brain to operate clearly and it removes that burden from your mind. So id wager it's more beneficial to complain in moderation than to not most of the time. Also, from my experience it's a great ice breaker, an easy way to relate to other people, and often doesn't come off as annoying.

Stoic advice for the probable loss of a pet?,"I've been reading about stoicism for about a year now and its had a huge impact on my mental health, however recently my ability to put it to use has been tested to say the least. 

This may seem trivial compared to other peoples problems, but I have a young cat (soon to be five y/o) who I may lose in the near future. He has a condition he has to be medicated for and this medication has a long list of probable side effects, the biggest one being another illness where I have decided that I would rather put him down than make him go through that treatment.

This is not a 100% certanity, but it is indeed a very probable risk and I cannot stop worrying, waiting and bracing myself for the heartache of having to decide to let him go. I have had more time than many others have gotten and I try to be thankful for this and to appreciate each day instead of thinking about the next, but this is constantly on my mind and I feel so sad and anxious about it.

Seeing things just as they are,"Hello everybody. 
Lately I've been advancing in my studies of Stoicism and I've come to a realization, more of the development of a skill actually. Lately I have been able to see things the way they are. What do I mean by this?

Someone says an insult. Is it good? Bad? It was just an insult, or more radically, just words that were cataloged negatively by us.

Someone outplayed you? They just did a certain action. Now it is up to you to cataloge it in a way.
 
Do you feel frustration? It was just a feeling that makes you stay alert and feel weird things, not necessarily bad. 

After meditating on this new skill that I have been developing, I was very confused how should I use it in a way that is constructive, for the Virtue, for the community and for my path. Now I realize that insults are starting to lose meaning for me, therefore they start to mean less and less, it's just words, and now I feel some kind of power, like ""I can do whatever I want with that insult"". Destructive behaviors, the same. I have been gradually overcoming that confusion through Stoic ethics, at least the few I've studied about it. I decide to use this for what I judge to be good, the justice, for the community, for my learning and development path. It is interesting. Have any of you experienced this before?

Antipater,"I see a lot of people seeking advice so I thought I would switch things up with some food for thought. Stoicism seems to be perceived as an all or nothing philosophy that encourages us to not feel and discourages us when we fall short. This doesn’t have to be the case. Antipater, the 6th leader of the stoic school formed by Zeno, took the philosophy in another direction than his predecessors by loosening some of the absolutist rules that had been laid before him. Early stoics held that all sins were wrong and equal. Antipater rejected this notion recognizing that stealing a loaf of bread is not the same as murdering the baker for the bread. In Lives of the Stoics, by Stephen Hanselman and Ryan Holiday, they compare the modern stoic to an archer. “We train and practice. We draw back the arrow and aim it to the best of our abilities. But we know full well that despite our training and our aim, many factors outside our control will influence where the arrow hits the target-or if it falls short entirely. We take action. But much happens after that-much of it is not remotely up to us. Which is why we know that our true worth does not reside in whether or not we get a bullseye.”  I thought that was a fitting analogy. Something to think on, something I wanted to share.",Stoicism,1702600428.0,t3_18inafj,0.69,6
Should I be always trying to think if I did the most virtue thing that I could?,"I was thinking about that: Should I be, after all actions, thinking about them and questioning myself if it was the best action i could take or should I simply focus on trying to take the best action and later on on the day, maybe evening, I stop and think about that while journaling or meditating, and focusing the judgment of my action on this period of the day? That came to my mind because a lot of times I end up being caught on my own thoughts in the mid of the day trying to judge some action of mine and this leads to more untoughtful actions.

Having trouble reading Epictetus,"Hi,

I've read The Meditations (and loved it) so I wanted to see what Epictetus had to say as well. I got to about chapter 18 (or I18?) in book 1 and honestly I'm just confused at this point. 

I understand the Discourses are, well, discourses and not really a book written by Epictetus himself, but still I find his arguments being rather confusing and messy. Not very clear. 

For example: Chapter, 17, is titled ""concerning the necessity of logic"" (I got the penguin classics edition). Epictetus starts by presenting a problem/paradox - reason can only be analyzed either by itself or by something superior, however ""there is nothing superior to reason"" and reason cannot analyze itself because it creates an endless loop. Then he goes on to address a claim (hypothetical or from someone in the audience? i'm not sure) saying that regardless, emotions are more important than logic, only to show that it isn't the case and that no debate could be held with rules set by emotions.

So, he says, we use logic to define the terms in which we analyze things and discuss among ourselves (but how is that related to the paradox at the begging?). Then he goes on to argue against another claim against logic and then he ends up with talking about understanding nature, some victim of something unclear and then God and a philosopher's power of interpretation.

Of course it's much more complicated but I tried to keep it short XD

So as you can see, this is what I got from this chapter. Honestly I don't understand what he was trying to say and it's the same in most of the other chapters. He seems a bit all-over-the-place for me.

I wanted to know if other readers faced the same problem or is it just me? Is he getting clearer in following chapters? Maybe you could give me tips on how to read Epictetus, maybe I'm missing something?

Thanks!",Stoicism,1702629634.0,t3_18ivnaq,0.6,1
"If emotions seem to be a natural result of the body, why are we trying to control them so much?","There's a concept in stoicism that we should control that which we can, and accept those things which we cannot.  But can we really control the fact we feel emotions?  I've never met anyone who doesn't experience them, and personally they feel very instant and inevitable.  It seems like to me, I have an inevitable emotion, and then a controllable, separate, external reaction to it.

To me, once I'm already feeling an emotion, it makes it much worse to try and suppress it.  So I kind of just give myself permission to feel whatever naturally comes.  Letting myself be okay with not being okay is deeply liberating and has really been centering to me emotionally, but it seems this isn't the majority consensus on the stoic treatment of emotions, and me admitting to others I'm feeling certain emotions isn't stoic at all.  But when I do this, I feel much more calm and controlled, and the emotions I do have are smaller on the outside.

So I wanted to ask if there's an appropriately stoic way to see this.  I've been reading Epictetus and so far nothing in the enchiridion goes against what I'm saying.  But it seems this is not the common interpretation of the content, and that most have a concept of a stoic being a sort of iceman/woman

"""There is nothing fearful in nature for the rational man""","I've come across this quote in a lecture about Marcus Aurelius ( Michael Sugrue). Quotes like this and others

""He who fears death will never do anything worth of a man who is alive"" - Seneca.

underscore  the paralyzing effect of fear. I often find myself hesitating to do stuff held back by the uncertainty and anxiety surrounding the unknown, so by fear. Most of these fears are irrational. Quotes like this remind that life is meant to be lived and always avoiding things u fear kills u in a metaphorical sense. And if worse comes to worst injury, death or other losses are all just part of nature and therefore not anything to be afraid of.

My mind goes nuts over a choice that I didn't have,"I want to embrace stoicism, but my mind keeps pointing me back to my ""old"" ways. 

This is the weirdest most recent example: 
I recently started a new job. Part of that was getting a company car. Normally you'd order one from the 3 choices the company has for you, these are mainly the cheapest versions of cars. With the push to ev's however this means I can only choose electric cars. We already have one ev at home and like an ice car as backup, so my only option is getting one from the company pool. 

I had two choices: a few months old ford focus or a 3 years old Opel Astra. I obviously went for the Ford, added bonus is that when i do have to pick an EV i can pick a more matured one. 

Now I have a colleague who was fortunate and could choose one of the last Ice cars. He went for the new Opel Astra. Turns out that basic Astra is way more luxurious than my Ford albeit a bit more expensive. 

My mind now constantly goes into ""what if"" mode. Because of course, my mind believes the new Opel is the better choice. I believe this goes back to my constant persuit of perfection. If i have choices, no matter what they are about, u always try to go for the best and very best one. 

Tl;dr:
My mind is contemplating over a choice I didn't even have. Stoicism tells me that all I have control over is my own judgement, yet my mind can't stop overthinking this. What to do? 

And yes, I know this is a first world problem. I'm happy with the car and very fortunate, but I also want to make clear that I do pay for it.",Stoicism,1702547760.0,t3_18i59ss,0.6,3
A stoic perspective on the irreplaceable,"My Dad passed away suddenly this year. First and foremost he was an amazing father with a deep sense of duty and community. He was a well respected Jungian psychologist both in his practice and as a professor. He was a role model in the relationship he shared with my mom and a man that practiced what he preached. He has been the most influential person in my life.

I’m posting this in hope that someone else may find value in my reflections on how stoicism influenced my thoughts around his passing. 

————

When we accept that we have been deprived of something we once had, our next logical instinct is to choose one of the following courses of action: find it, replace it, or do without it.

When something irreplaceable is taken, we cannot find it again because it exists nowhere else. We cannot replace it, as that is the definition of irreplaceable. Then, we are seemingly left with only one option: to do without. What may seem as the lesser of three outcomes is the most beautiful. 

When we accept the nature of what was given back as irreplaceable we can only choose to do without. Once that choice is made we can be at peace with what was given back. We no longer struggle to find what we had again or recreate it. Accepting that we will never have what we had ever again is not a lamentation, it is a testament to how beautiful and special it was. 

We must see ourselves as artists and what is gone as our work of art. We may enjoy creating the work, admire its shape as it takes form, and even the struggle to make it beautiful. The complete and refined beauty of our work can only be seen after we are finished with it. Our appreciation for what we created is deepened when we know every step that formed it.

We shouldn’t look back at what we had and wish we still had it. We now have the privilege to look back on it as completed. We get to admire how beautiful our journey with it was from start to finish. Our focus is on how grateful we are that fate allowed us to have something so precious at all, regardless of duration. 

It’s the rarest joy to give back something that cannot be replaced.

"A short review, and a question, regarding unearned wisdom in the modern era. Would love to hear your thoughts.","UNEARNED WISDOM IN THE MODERN ERA

Growing up and living in the modern era provides a unique experience, compared to our ancestors’, in respect to the accessibility of information. In a world where we are more interconnected than ever before, we are blessed to have instant and untethered access to knowledge and information in mere seconds, through use of the internet.

Lessons that once took a near lifetime to learn can be easily accessed by keyboard. Endless archives of wisdom, built upon through the ages, as a result of hard work and discipline, hand us the opportunity to learn and grow on a silver platter.

Herein the problem lies, many of us are constantly looking outwards for answers, or worse yet, outsourcing a sense of purpose and growth, subcontracting the hard work and toil required to gain such wisdom, and condensing said effort into mere seconds, leaving us overstimulated, desensitised, and none-the-wiser.

Knowledge, without practical application, is almost useless. That is, unless your goal is to *sound* like someone who has their life together. But actions speak louder than words, and eventually these pseudo-sages will demonstrate their lack of self control.

So, then the question remains, how do you pick the low-hanging fruit of the modern day world, and turn it into actual, practical wisdom?

Wisdom can be defined as *‘the quality of having experience, knowledge and good judgement’.*

In order to reach good judgement, we must first possess the knowledge, which can be unlocked through the experience.

Here is a step-by-step process for effectively gaining accurate wisdom through experience:

**Step One**

A certain event will happen, which has a significant outcome, either expected or not. The more intensely positive, or negative, the experience is, the more valuable information there may be to learn, and the higher levels of emotion that may be produced as a by-product.

**Step Two**

Reflection on the experience, if possible including the ability to compare it to others, the vision to explore other possible outcomes, creating knowledge. Reflection must come from an emotionally stable perspective, otherwise it can distort the lesson which remains to be learned.

For example, a start-up business which fails, losing a lot of money, will be a highly emotional event, but inside will be a treasure trove of knowledge and experience, which could undoubtedly help in the future.

Concerning pearls of wisdom, it should be known, that in order to claim the precious gemstone from the tightly clasped oyster, your fingers will get sore and bloodied in the process.

If the event is reviewed from an emotionally driven perspective, the person involved may say: “I knew my colleagues were right, I am not cut out to be a businessman, I should have just stayed in my previous job.”

But this does not give much, if any, useful feedback. It just provides an emotional reasoning as to why the event unfolded this way, rather than a logical situational report which can better guide us in the future.

And this kind of emotional response is not only negatively-based, for example if the same new business was instantly a huge success, perhaps the emotionally driven reflection would be: “I am so great at opening businesses. I must have the golden touch!” – creating a false sense of genius in oneself, leading to overreaching and under-preparing later on.

In order to be successful and accurate in your reflection of events, you must be emotionally removed. This can take time, to detach yourself from the immediacy of the situation, but necessary in order to have an impartial perspective.

**Step Three**

The ability to judge new situations, and modify choices or behaviour based on the knowledge gained from previous experience, thus defining wisdom.

In order to be able to draw on such knowledge, like in the previous step, you must begin with an emotionally stable frame-of-mind. With a higher risk or reward relying on the outcome of the event in question, the situation will become more emotionally charged, making emotional detachment more difficult, creating a reaction, rather than an action.

With this step-by-step of earning wisdom through experience, the question stands. Not all those who are experienced are wise, but is it possible to become wise without experience? How do you absorb the wisdom of lessons which you haven’t lived yourself?",Stoicism,1702468375.0,t3_18hf56u,0.57,1
The concept of virtue is circular,"Stoics advocate for following virtue, but what how might one define what is virtuous? A stoic would respond: ""that which results in your contentment/ what is in your nature.""   


The skeptic would rightly reply, ""what makes you content?""   


The Stoic would reply: ""That which uses the right reason""  


And on and on the circular reasoning goes. Without defining what contentment is or what the right reason is, this is a never ending circle and doesn't mean anything.   


Another counterargument: that which is just, wise, moderate and courageous is what makes you content.   


The skeptic would reply ""Why are those things virtues and not something else?"" And there is no answer.   


Finally, a Stoic might say something like: ""That which is good for you is the right use of reason""  


The skeptic would reply: ""But you just said that the only thing good for me is the right use of reason. If the only thing that is good is reason, then why is what is good for you the right use of reason? In other words, doing what is good is the right use of judgement, but you haven't actually defined what is good. Without defining what is good, then what makes it a good judgement?"" As you can see, there is circular reasoning once again.

How much mental energy or thought process does practicing Stoicism take up?,"BTW: I wasn't sure if I should be putting this in the ""New to Stoicism"" or in ""Seeking Stoic Advice"" - I've only been interested in Stoicism as a means for dealing with my own circumstances for the past year or so.

For some context: I struggle with the actual practicing of Stoicism, mostly due to having ADHD (mostly the Inattentive type).  Despite trying to work on it, I can often find the impulsive nature of my mind engages way too quickly.  If I'm in a 'hyperfocused' state regarding Stoicism, I can manage that a little better - but the effort it seems to take mentally is exhausting.

So:

I don't think I've seen this discussed - but how much time and effort is spent mentally going over the practice of being Stoic?  I am aware in CBT there are often things like half-hour daily exercises, but these are really more transformative things that are designed to work over longer periods.  To me, Stoicism is more a 'way of life' kind of philosophy and thinking - reacting to and interpreting situations and circumstances constantly.

That constant examination and practice seems exhausting to me.  I'm the kind of person who can become mentally exhausted after doing a client meeting, or having a slightly busier day, or just one of those days where my brain decides to inner monologue about anything and everything constantly.  Add to that all the little rules I have to follow otherwise I'll lose things, forget things and generally mess my day up horribly.  I often have to force myself to mono-task and try to keep focus even doing a simple thing like making a cup of tea or a sandwich.

This is all compounded by my seeing this quote of Epictetus: ""Don't explain your philosophy.  Embody it."" when I've been searching for some kind of guidance.  To me, to embody something is to take it on completely, utterly - it becomes ***everything***.

I guess alternatively - what is a good balance of applying Stoic principles in your mind over just letting things flow naturally to see how well the practices are taking hold? 

(In my life, and mind, if I'm not actively thinking about a process, then that process can very much not exist at all.  So coming into a situation where I *could* practice a Stoic principle, I'll forget that I can and instead do something else, and on reflection, something worse.)

I hope this makes sense, it's really hard for me to put down into words exactly what I'm trying to get across (and I'm sure I've probably missed some obvious point I should have made lol).",Stoicism,1702425079.0,t3_18h1dcc,0.79,8

Stoicism for giving birth,"
I'm going to be giving birth in a few weeks. What advice does Stoic philosophy have for me? Has anyone on here faced this experience and found Stoic perspectives helpful?

I plan to use pain medication in combination with other coping techniques - I find it most helpful personally to think of childbirth as lying along the spectrum of human experience that we can bring the resources of humanity (modern medicine!) to bear against, rather than a primal/natural event that my body will handle in a way separate from other parts of my life. (Dying is also part of the human experience, and people with a choice in the matter rarely form a goal of ""getting through it without unnatural interventions."") But I also understand that people feel many ways about this topic, and have a great admiration for people who pursue an unmedicated delivery - please don't make this post into a war about which of these approaches is ""more Stoic.""

Even though I expect to get an epidural, the education and medical advice I've gotten are consistent in recommending to delay epidurals until fairly late in the game (or at least it seems late to me) to avoid slowing labor. Epidurals can also fail or turn out to be unavailable for a variety of reasons. So I know I'm in for ??? hours of steadily increasing discomfort and pain, in an altered mental and hormonal state I haven't experienced before.  I also have never had my pain tolerance tested to an extreme degree, and know that pain tolerance and the experience of what labor feels like varies hugely. 

I vacilate between using voluntary discomfort as opportunities to practice not-suffering, and trying not to borrow worry/suffering from the future by going too nuts with it. I hold a lot of ice cubes and long yoga poses, and have access to good resources for specific mental management techniques for handling contractions.

Stoic perspectives have been very helpful to me during pregnancy, both for pregnancy symptoms (treatable and untreatable) and for thinking about upcoming labor.  There is a lot I can't control both about things that are inevitable (pain) and things that are unknowable (what complications arise, if I have back labor or require other medical interventions, if my epidural fails) - and it's very freeing to realize this means that me ruminating about it won't change anything.

Breakup Guilt,"Hello,

Six months ago my boyfriend left me. I was very emotional in the relationship, driven by my insecurities. This led him to cheat and then abandon me and cut contact completely. These last months, all I’ve been doing is playing a loop in my head hoping I would’ve done things differently and he’d still be here. I feel like I was abusive and it is haunting me. I learned so much and I’ll never be like that again, but I learned it after losing him. I’m filled with regret and constantly telling myself it was all my fault.

Can anyone offer me some advice?

Thank you.",Stoicism,1702448585.0,t3_18hagsf,0.52,1
I’m struggling to understand the stoic texts,"Per this sub I started reading the Dialogues of Epictetus. I just finished chapter one of book one and am very confused. 

Some of his sentences make total sense to me, but others are very confusing. For example, it starts off with “Of all the faculties, you will find not one which is capable of contemplating itself; and, consequently, not capable either of approving or disapproving.“ This just leaves me confused. What are all the faculties? He then gives the example of grammatic art and music as faculties that can’t contemplate themselves. And the “rational faculty” as the only one that can. I’m confused what specifically this even is. 

Is there a good line by line commentary on the Dialogues that I can read along side it in order to better understand?",Stoicism,1702413618.0,t3_18gvslf,0.75,4

Love is hindering me in becoming a better stoic,"Hey beautiful ppl. I would consider myself somewhat of a good stoic I have learned a lot since learning about a year and half ago. Controlling my emotions was big problem for me in the past but not anymore so I thank you guys for helping with that and the other things i struggled with.

But im stuck right now, getting to emotionally attached towards girls i meet is a ""problem"" i guess since it always results in them ghosting me at the end even tho they seem interested for a while. I go to a deep placve in my mind where i overthink the situation and it effects my everyday life and how i am towards people sometimes. What can I do to improve here im trying my hardest but still seems kinda hard. Hope it makes sense

Why should the Stoic not be self indulgent?,"Hello all,

I am reading through Meditations for the first time and early on he mentions that one thing he learned from his adopted father was not to be too self indulgent and he admired that he had, “no concern for food, or the cut and color of his clothes, or having attractive slaves.”

My understanding is that stoicism teaches us how to better handle adversity and how to carry yourself in a way that others can respect. I don’t understand why caring about how you present yourself would negatively impact the Stoic. 

I agree that flaunting wealth or the material possessions you have as being anti stoic but I don’t see how private self indulgence is.",Stoicism,1702397545.0,t3_18gpgx6,0.61,4
How do you practice not trying to get stressed out about things out of your control? Is that missing the point?,"I have a bumpy relationship with my mother. She frequently burns bridges with people and is generally negative and depressing to be around. She burned a bridge with my fiance last year, and generally has a bad relationship with my sister. This xmas we will all be spending it in separate locations (which is fine with me given the situation) but my mom is being super negative about it because she believes the 24th is ""her"" time to have us at her house. Long story short, shes tough to be around and pushes people away but still wants us to spend time with her.

I called her today to invite her to our house for xmas, since my sister would be away and I know my mom has no one else to spend xmas with (other than her husband and his family). She says she will be spending xmas with them and goes on a low key rant about how we won't be with her and how we don't want to go over to her house anymore, etc. I even tell her that we will plan to all be at her house next year, and she replies with ""yeah if im even alive next year"". Like, that is some straight up emotional abuse right there lol.

I dreaded calling her. I had anxiety thinking about the conversation. This is not right. I am not making any rash decisions because of this, in part thanks to stoicism. I understand this is out of my control and that I cannot change how she feels/acts/talks. The thing I don't like is still being stressed out about it. The dread. The anxiety. Am I missing the point of stoicism if I'm still trying to figure out how to remove those emotions?",Stoicism,1702417615.0,t3_18gxd92,0.67,2
"Social media toxicity, R/vegan, and what should I do.","So I am recently new to Reddit, again. I was on reddit back in  2012 to 2014, but stopped until this year. I like how Reddit is mostly more positive, especially compared to the toxicity of Facebook. 
I have found great communities from books, dogs, satellite radio fans, to philosophy.
But something recently left a bad taste in my mouth. I am vegetarian and try mostly for a vegan diet due to my morality with animals. Not preaching this is just my personal beliefs, but I feel this is important information for the story.
So anyways I also joined R/vegan.
I posted a few times on the subreddit and recently I posted an article entitled ""Veganism is in crisis, and the fanatics can only blame themselves"" and asked what the people what they thought of the criticism. Just because I was curious. I did not write the article.
But I would say about 40% to 45% started to attack me personally or my online persona I guess.
I like to think I have tuff skin and shit posters and trolls don't bother me, but this time it kind of did.
I was just asking what people thoughts were and to start a discussion. I didn't give my opinion of the article and I have been posting on the board for awhile. 
But almost half of them seemed mad at me, I tried to defend myself, but they didn't seem to care. After a few responses I realized I was just wasting my time and deleted my post and blocked a few people. 
I had my wife look at the post and she says it did not look offensive or anything like that, but I do admit she could be biased.
I was really starting to like Reddit with the discussions. But R/vegan makes me question if I should give up social media in general. I don't know. 
I like the discussions, but I am getting to old to deal with shit posters all the time. I am not sure if this was a one time fluke, a vegan thing (I am not unrealistic, I know how they can be sometimes), a reddit thing, or just people...

"Stoicism and kids ""pranks""","My house has been frequently targeted by kids kicking my door (main suspension is tik tok door kicking challenge/ ding dong ditch).

Despite all that, I am working 40 hour weeks while pursuing a bachelor's degree full time. Most Bachelors in my field take three-four years to complete, and I am on track to complete it in just over two.

I am giving up my anxiety and desire for control over my environment and learning more and more to focus on myself. Compared to where I was this time last year, I have forged a far better path for myself and my future is more and more certain. 

Despite the odds, Stoicism has helped keep me focus, step back from myself, and prevent me from circling the drain when things have gotten hard. I am forging my future with my own hands and taking responsibility for who and what I will become.

Stoicism and Hamas/Israel War,"All,

Struggling to approach the current war with the right philosophical mindset. 

I'm marginally Jewish and feel (largely due to being online, not familial) tied to the Israeli side. I view the Israelis as losing, by a large margin, the information war being fought online right now. (To clarify, I don't support their widespread bombing or cutting off food/water or the West Bank settlements, but I also don't support anyone whose ultimately goal is to kill or marginalize Jews.)

How do you cope with other's opinions,"I recently took to stoicism and it's principles. This was since February 2023. I have been working on myself physically, mentally and emotionally. Howover, recently I had the pleasure of meeting my friends of old. There was this one particular person that I had a falling out with. I have made amends to that relationship as best as possible later. But this particular person seems to enjoy picking me apart. I care for this person and I cryptically suggested that they reflect on their feelings and find out if they were going wrong in some way.

Stoicism - Reading the news or not?,"I've been involved with stoicism for about a year now. Reading books, listening to podcasts, watching videos etc. I feel like I have successfully applied rules and values to my life. I am definitely less angry, my short temper is gone, I'm able to smile more, I accept things for who or what they are, I generally feel better etc.

Recently, I had had a discussion with a friend of mine. He isn't as involved in stoicism, but he knows what it is and it's core values.

He asked me about an event that happened in the world, and I told him I wasn't aware of it, because I don't read the news. He asked why, and I told him that the news make me angry, thus I avoid it. Although, I still read news I find interesting that doesn't upset me, like technology and some entertainment news.

He told me that he can read the news and not get angry, and stay neutral regardless of what he's reading. That's definitely not me. The news themselves, and how the media stirs the pot and presents the news, it's a breeding ground for anger. So I avoid it, and in return I'm happier, with the blowback of not staying as informed about the world (which can be a blessing and a curse).

My friend told me that a TRUE stoic, would be able to read any news and stay neutral, and me avoiding the news isn't what a stoic person should do. A stoic person should block out external things while staying informed. He argued that I should train myself to read the news, whatever it is, and stay neutral.

This intrigued me. It felt like a superpower. But me training myself by reading negative news, and forcing myself to stay neutral, sounds awful. I mean, how long would that take?

But first let's get the definition down here. Local news headline: 8-year-old girl sexually assaulted by 3 men. Alright… Do I smash things around me? No. But I carry this news with me in the back of my head, and it's there, making me angrier than I should have been if I didn't read it. It can affect my entire day.

I don't see how a person could read that and stay neutral? In fact, that out right sounds like a psychopath.

What do you think?

EDIT: So many incredible comments. I wasn't expecting to get so dwelled down into stoic theory. This was great. 

Based on a lot of your comments as well as stoic theory, I'm guessing my friend is correct. However, flooding myself with negatiity just to stay informed about world events; isn't something I see as something good. 

Also important to mention is the fact that one news article doesn't upset me, or make me angry, despite the original post making it look like that. I'm talking about watching and reading general media news on a daily basis, and over months or years building a negative mindset. I can read a bad piece of news and brush it off. Should have made that more clear from the start.

I've been heavily informed, and I have been heavily uninformed (current state), and based on my mood and life in general, I prefer to be uninformed. Not MISINFORMED, but UNINFORMED. Reading up in current local news is a good thing. Reading up what happens on the other side of the world does no longer interest me.

I still have addictions, I feel hyper sexual so i masturbait daily. I play computer a lot and I work as much as possible. I love working but my job, isn’t something that I can do daily. Because it’s sort of like a company that finds jobs for me where I can work, and if they need me I’ll be there.

But I also find that I tend to get more addicted to things, I constantly have tendencies of seeing myself as a man child even though I have been told I’m very mature. I seek attention, and I have over reactions and I worry a lot.

What would the stoics have thought about eating animals in modern day?,"After reading meditations, it's clear that Marcus Aurelius was focused on living within his own nature as a human being, and valued the humans ability to reason above everything.

On one hand, eating meat is human nature, we are clearly omnivores and have eaten meat as a species for as long as we've been around. 
However in modern day, eating meat isn't a requirement to live a healthy life, and the mass production of meat is widely thought to be inefficient and cruel, so using reason and the information we have available, eating meat wouldn't be the virtuous choice.

I've just been thinking about this lately, and thought there was a bit of a clash between our nature and our ability to reason in this area.

One major change and some minor changes to the subreddit,"Howdy, we have decided on the small handful of changes described below.

\- **The New Agora**  
In order to better ensure that users seeking Stoic advice receive well-informed, specifically Stoic responses, we have decided to make a major change in the subreddit. Posts with the ""Seeking Stoic Advice"" flair will now be considered as seeking specifically and recognizably Stoic advice. Users who are seeking and offering personal opinions inspired by Stoicism, sharing experiences that may be influenced by Stoicism, or requesting and attempting to administer ""[first aid](https://modernstoicism.com/two-types-of-stoic-therapy-by-john-sellars/)"" will be welcome to do so in the New Agora, a daily pinned thread for these and other types of exchanges (including, for example, casual questions users don't want create posts for and extremely limited self-promotion). The New Agora is not an anything-goes thread; instead, it is for things that may be more tangentially, rather than directly, Stoic. Activity that is way off-base remains unwelcome.  
If your ""Seeking Stoic Advice"" post is removed because you are seeking personal opinions or asking what-would-you-do questions, you may instead post in the New Agora. 

\- **User flairs**  
In the interest of improving communication, we have decided to implement user flairs. In order to receive a user flair, message the moderators with your request. Pending our consensus, informed by our review of your activity, our background knowledge, and/or other factors, we will assign the flair and it will appear beside your username when you are active here. You may apply for flairs in accordance with the most suitable descriptors of your experience or interest. For example, flairs may include ""qualified/trustworthy user,"" ""academic/scholar,"" or ""προκόπτων."" The moderators may also decide to grant flairs to users on their own, without applications in mod messages, pending the user's agreement.

\- **Post flairs**  
As mentioned, the ""Seeking Stoic Advice"" flair is now strictly for seeking well-informed advice strictly drawing from and clearly aligned with Stoic philosophy.The ""Stoic Theory/Study"" flair will now only be assigned by moderators. If you would like to use this flair on your post, use the ""Pending Theory/Study"" flair. This will flag our attention, and we will review your post to determine whether to assign the ""Stoic Theory/Study"" flair. This is intended to prevent the misuse of the flair that is primarily meant for longform, well-informed, and careful posts, rather than pop-philosophy-type content, short personal observations, and newcomer questions.

Things may change, but we are going to move forward and monitor how well things work. If you have any questions, concerns, or other feedback, feel free to let us know.

What are some modern stoic texts you can recommend?,"When I was in 7th grade I read “The seven habits of highly effective people.” I didn’t know it at the time, but that was my first exposure to many of the stoic principles. A couple years later I read “Man’s search for meaning” and that book deeply moved me and taught me so much about the core of stoicism. In 11th grade I read “The Tao of Pooh” and used that book as a my personal spiritual guidebook until I discovered stoicism. When I was introduced to stoicism by the book “a guide to the good life” I felt like I had found a way of living that brought together the fundamental principles that had inspired and spoken to me throughout my life. I still consider myself very new to stoicism as it has only been a year and half since I started seriously studying it. Even so, one of my favorite things to do is to look for parallels in the works of the ancient stoics and that of other books I read, especially fiction.

Does stoic philosophy provide a justification for the holocaust?,"Good day all, I have this question that I have not been able to google and am keen to hear your opinions. That is, how would a stoic look at the holocaust? Epictetus says ""Things that are not within our own power, not without our Will, can by no means be either good or evil"". So if you were someone within the concentration camp, would you say that the holocaust was neither good nor evil and embrace it? 

He also says ""until you know their reasons, how do you know they’ve acted wrongly"". And the same applies here, if you do not know why a nazi did what he did, how do we say it was wrong? Just because he had orders to kill someone, does not mean there were not anterior motives, motives we are not aware of. 

Please let me know what you think. This community is well more versed in stoic philosophy than I.

Question about one’s own nature,"Hello,

I was contemplating about the fact that people can have their own ""natures"". For instance, I find that my nature is to provide for a family by having a job and loving/providing for them. Because of that, I studied and got a job to make that happen. 

I find my nature to be virtuous because I’m also serving society and whatnot, but then I thought I probably am biased in my line of thinking. 

I thought of a scenario where a person thinks that not working and not serving society is what nature demands of them due to any hypothetical reason (maybe they think society has failed them and that the right thing to do is to act against it). In that case, doing the opposite of what I thought was virtuous would become the virtuous thing to do for this person.

Is my thought on the right track? Or are there established guidelines for one’s nature to be virtuous? I thought of this after reminding myself of how Diogenes was praised by some stoic philosophers in some aspects (like in the famous banquet analogy).",Stoicism,1702266825.0,t3_18flmnz,0.75,4

Is this stoicism or something else? Vanity?,"Life is suffering. To engage in life's pleasures is to cause more greater suffering later in life. To the contrary, to allow yourself to suffer and deal with the suffering of life in the present, softens the suffering later in life.

Example. People go on vacation and blow thousands of dollars instead of working or investing that money. They buy temporary happiness, but end up slaving for money for more of their life. To the contrary, someone who does not partake in these types of temporary happiness, save money and invest and can become financially free and reduce their suffering later in life by embracing the hard work and discipline it takes to focus on what is important; in this case that is financial freedom.

"Self sufficiency over virtue, initially","I've been revisiting a piece in the Discourses http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0236%3Atext%3Ddisc%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D9,  and I know that ""self sufficiency is the greatest of all wealth"" is Epicurean(I think), and wealth is an indifferent in Stoicism?, but..

""..But a man may say, Whence shall I get bread to eat when I have nothing?""...""Wretch, if you have it, you will have it; if you have it not, you will depart from life...""

Somewhere in that section Epictetus calls some animals irrational and cowardly and then regards them at the same time for being self sufficient and living according to nature. I've heard that the success rate of a hunt for lions in our African wilderness is about 25% and many of them die from starvation. But when they succeed, they roar without reply and ravage without resistance.  I've also heard that tigers are pretty unremorseful. 

""...But we think about ourselves, as if we were only stomachs, and intestines, and shameful parts; we fear, we desire; we flatter those who are able to help us in these matters, and we fear them also...""

""..And shall it be necessary for one among us who is a philosopher to travel into foreign parts, and trust to and rely on others, and not to take care of himself, and shall he be inferior to irrational animals...""

It's coming off alittle like ""do it yourself, do what you have to do to survive..or atleast do what your nature requires in that given context because even actions which appear to be—and indeed are—immoral or unjust advance the overall design, which taken as a whole is harmonious and

Stoicism doesn’t account for the unvirtuous motivations of beneficial behavior,"Many criticisms of stoicism are based upon faulty logic or misunderstandings, but one criticism that has always stuck with me is stoicism seems to underestimate is the heavy influence of unvirtuous motivations to drive positive behaviour.

Stoicism emphasizes the importance of a proper perspective, and valuing virtue above all else. Typically it is seen as unvirtuous to allow your emotions to control you, to allow yourself to stress unnecessarily, or to pursue things like sex, status or ego. 

However, modern psychology indicates these are humanities strongest motivators.  Thus, the closer to a sage you become, the more you eliminate these motivators, and the less productive of a citizen you will become, which ends up defeating a large part of being stoic in the first place. 

You can argue: “To stoics the only thing that matters is you are virtuous.” Would it be virtuous to decline a method which allow you can help fellow man more? Is it not selfish to reject the ability to care more because it harms you more?",Stoicism,1702278563.0,t3_18fos0s,0.33,0

Seneca was highly influential to many Christians scholars to the point someone most likely forged correspondence (an early example of fanfiction) between him and Paul the Apostle.

It's like...I'm ""running out of thoughts"". Sometimes, my mind would be cluttered and I want to write things down but I just can't seem to start without consulting my resources for specific guide questions.

EVERYTHING that happens is preordained,"I feel anxious. I have to give a presentation tomorrow and I feel anxious. But that's not what worries me. What worries me is the very fact that I am anxious. I have read meditations hundreds of times, I shouldn't feel this way. I should be armed with the thought that nothing in the universe can happen that is bad, because what the universe creates is guided by the laws of logic and cannot be anything but good.

The problem here is with the ""should"". You simultaneously say that the universe cannot give way to something that is bad but at the same time say that what is happening right now is wrong. The universe is wrong, in this case. Everything that the universe has so far created, the big bang, the birth of humanity, the rise of democracy, have been good and without mistake - until today. You being anxious is the universe's first mistake.

Of course this makes no sense. By ""everything that happens is good"" it follows that your anxiety has to be good. If tomorrow you should feel so anxious that you throw up, that is good. A central problem with this line of thinking has to do with expectation. ""I feel like I have done everything right so I shouldn't be feeling this way."" The hardest part, I think, is truly letting go of this expectation. We practice philosophy or spiritualism or religion because we want to be happy but often it is this goal that gets in the way of that happiness. You will still keep practicing, but remember that it is not up to you how things will go or how you will feel. Feeling bad can be a symptom of a problem that you should try to fix but it is not the feeling itself that you should try to fix or even bother with at all.

Edit: This post isn't about the damned presentation. I dont have anxiety about a presentation. I dont even have a presentation. This post was about the possivility of getting to hung up on ""it not working""/""I have read and taken notes on the discourses many times over""/""I have done everything correct"" and getting frustrated over your emotions persisting and your mind continuing to fluctuate. For the record I take full responsibility. I could definitily have phrased this post much better.

On descriptions and prescriptions,"**Introduction**

I’m sure everyone already intuitively knows the difference between prescriptions and descriptions, and can easily explain the difference when asked to. Yet quite often I see people on here struggle to apply this distinction in their Stoic practice.

In this post I will attempt to show this distinction in the context of practicing Stoicism and how one can practice more effectively by keeping it in mind.

**The difference**

The definitions of the words as per the Cambridge dictionary:

Prescription:

>the act of telling someone else what they must have or do.

Description:

>something that tells you what something or someone is like.

In my own understanding, a description is a list of characteristics that is associated with someone or something whereas a prescription is a list of instructions you can follow. We can easily *describe* how it is like for a master musician to play on an instrument, but to *prescribe* the training to attain such skills is a completely different thing.

In the context of training, a description tells you the goal that you wish to attain, and a prescription tells you the process towards  attaining that goal. In the causality chain of events, a description is the consequence and a prescription is an antecedent cause.

What this means is it makes sense to use prescriptions as your practice but not descriptions, and this is really where I see people struggle with.

Consider this simple example. If you sprain an ankle, the description of a “recovered ankle” is “you can run”. Do you then “run” with the sprained ankle so that you match the description of a “recovered ankle”? Of course not, we all have enough common sense to know this is ridiculous. What you do is ""following the doctor’s treatment plan”, or the “prescription”, until “you can run”, at which point you know you have “recovered” because what you can do matches the description. Being able to run is caused by having recovered, which in turn is caused by following the treatment plan.

But “running to recover” is exactly what people are doing when they say something along the lines of “I’m practicing Stoicism by not being disturbed by externals”, or “I’m following the Stoic principle of the cardinal virtues”. Not being disturbed by externals and the virtues are *descriptions* of a practiced Stoic, they are not *prescriptions* for your practice.

Epictetus himself talked about this in the following excerpt:

>But if he has striven merely to attain the state which he finds in his books and works only at that, and has made that the goal of his travels, I bid him go home at once and not neglect his concerns there, since the goal to which he has travelled is nothing; but not so that other goal—to study how a man may rid his life of sorrows and lamentations, and of such cries as ""Woe is me!"" and ""Wretch that I am!"" and of misfortune and failure, and to learn the meaning of death, exile, prison, hemlock; that he may be able to say in prison, ""Dear Crito, if so it pleases the gods, so be it,"" rather than, ""Alas, poor me, an old man, it is for this that I have kept my grey hairs!""

\- The Discourses of Epictetus I.4

I believe this confusion is primarily caused by being introduced to the Meditations as their first Stoic reading material, which brings me to my next point.

**How it applies to the original texts**

As I mentioned just now, I’d bet my money on the Meditations being the primary cause of this confusion. That’s because the Meditations is mostly *descriptive,* there are very few passages in there I can think of that are actually *prescriptive.*

We need to remember, that Marcus had had decades of Stoic training when he wrote it - he was already one of the most well-versed Stoics in human history; and the Meditations was not written to teach others to be like him – it was his private journal. A master guitarist doesn’t need to write down in his journal where to place his fingers on the guitar, he will probably write something like “a 1-minute solo would fit nicely in this segment of this song”.

The Discourses of Epictetus is by far the most *prescriptive* book out of all the remaining original Stoic texts we have. Epictetus is also quite explicit whenever he states his instructions if you read it carefully. Even Marcus himself implied the importance of this book in his Stoic education on the very first page of the Meditations:

>7. From Rusticus: to get an impression of need for reform and treatment of character; not to run off into zeal for rhetoric, writing on speculative themes, discoursing on edifying texts, exhibiting in fanciful colours the ascetic or the philanthropist. To avoid oratory, poetry, and preciosity; not to parade at home in ceremonial costume or to do things of that kind; to write letters in the simple style, like his own from Sinuessa to my mother. To be easily recalled to myself and easily reconciled with those who provoke and offend, as soon as they are willing to meet me. To read books accurately and not be satisfied with superficial thinking about things or agree hurriedly with those who talk round a subject. **To have made the acquaintance of the** ***Discourses*** **of Epictetus, of which he allowed me to share a copy of his own.**

\- The Meditations, book I

There is another anecdotal evidence of this book being a primary education material to the ancient Stoics:

>With these words then the Stoic rid himself of the rich Asiatic. But later, when we were approaching Brundisium and sea and sky were calm, I asked him what the reason for his fear was, which he had refused to reveal to the man who had improperly addressed him. And he quietly and courteously replied: “Since you are desirous of knowing, hear what our forefathers, the founders of the Stoic sect, thought about that brief but inevitable and natural fear, or rather,” said he, “read it, for if you read it, you will be the more ready to believe it and you will remember it better.” **Thereupon before my eyes he drew from his little bag the fifth book of the** ***Discourses*** **of the philosopher Epictetus, which, as arranged by Arrian, undoubtedly agree with the writings of Zeno and Chrysippus.**

\- Aulus Gellius’ The Attic Nights

It should be abundantly clear at this point that the Discourses of Epictetus was amongst the most important Stoic learning materials at the time, and the people back then also had access to the works  of other prominent Stoic figures such as Zeno and Chrysippus. We are fortunate enough to still have access to this book in modern times (albeit half of it is lost), there is simply no reason we shouldn’t follow what the ancients did by using it as our main educational text.

Seneca’s letters and essays are also a decent source of instructional texts. The problem is his love of verbal barrage (he was a famous playwright at the time) means his writings are often very long-winded and in my opinion excessively sophisticated for the purpose of education.

I find his writings more poetic than they are educational, and I often find myself lost in a sort of “trance” when reading his texts, especially his essays. I still struggle to keep track of Seneca’s points when reading his essays to this day.

To me reading Seneca is something I do more for “reading pleasure” for a lack of better words than for learning. Of course that’s just me, if you have a different experience with reading Seneca then by all means do it as part of your learning.

**How we apply it in our Stoic practice**

A marathon runner and a sprinter both share the same goal of being the best at their sport, and thus to train their body to be at its physical peak in the most suitable way for their sport. But the marathon runner is primarily concerned with endurance whereas the sprinter speed. As such their training regimes have to be different.

It is also the case for our Stoic practice. Each of us has a different purpose, a different role to play in the cosmopolis; each of us has a different upbringing, different strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, how we train ourselves in the way of the Stoics must by necessity be different. Again I will quote Epictetus on this same point here:

>I am inclined to pleasure; I will betake myself to the opposite side of the rolling ship, and that beyond measure, so as to train myself. I am inclined to avoid hard work; I will strain and exercise my sense-impressions to this end, so that my aversion from everything of this kind shall cease. For who is the man in training? He is the man who practises not employing his desire, and practises employing his aversion only upon the things that are within the sphere of his moral purpose, yes, and practises particularly in the things that are difficult to master. **And so different men will have to practise particularly to meet different things**.

\- The Discourses of Epictetus III.12

**Conclusion**

In summary, if you wish to make progress in your Stoic training, it is important that you set yourself a description as a goal and devise a prescriptive plan to train yourself towards attaining that goal.

Don’t just start with a far-fetched goal like “I want to be like Marcus Aurelius!”. That’s like watching [a video of Van Halen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULEBSxP725w) and immediately saying “I want to play the guitar like him”, or reading about theoretical Physics for the first time and saying ""I want to win a Nobel prize in Physics!""

Start with something small and managable, something like “I want to stop being a slave to material wealth” if this is one of your weaknesses, then proceed to train yourself to get accustomed to a life with minimal material possessions.

It is also crucial that you are completely honest with yourself about your shortcomings, and be fully committed to follow the plan you devise, in the same vein you have to be completely honest with your doctor about your symptoms and follow her treatment plan if you want to recover most effectively from your illness.

My gf said dont take it seriously its bare minimum.. so the question here is.... I cannot meet my gf that much and all.. due to my studies and family reasons...so my mind rn is saying me that whatever i do for her... Is also bare minimum? Like as she said to her frnd... Is it same for me too? My efforts are bare minimum? Or can i approach this situation with the approach of letting it go?,Stoicism,1702123999.0,t3_18eccwr,0.25,0

Wow just came back here after a few years. This sub has changed SO much in that time,"When I used to partake a lot in this sub about 4-5 years ago, it was almost exclusively posts about Stoic practice and some theory. Most discussions at the very least started from the premise of, “how would the sage handle xyz situation, with reference to Stoic principles?”  

Now it’s basically, “I just broke up with my gf” or “how do I handle getting rejected by my crush?”

Nothing wrong with these questions, they have a place on an Internet forum for sure. But it’s just interesting how much the sub has changed away from actual Stoic focus since I last visited 

I think it may be time for a new Stoic sub",Stoicism,1701951451.0,t3_18cudij,0.96,228
Is stoicism the next philosophy of losing your humanity?,"I saw the comments and responses on that poor person's page. Yall were out here saying how it's different from any war and did we feel the same for Ukraine and what about Isreal. Like excuse me? Maybe it's not the same because it's a literal holocaust with 20000 ppl dead and half of them are children. We're seeing children with blown off faces and getting their limbs amputated and disembodied. Did you see that shit during the Ukraine War that's an actual war and not a holocaust? No? And why would you feel bad for the offending party who aren't suffering at all? Isreal has been doing and saying the most atrocious things. You people disgust me. Hiding behind your cope weak philosophy. Humanity needs to die out already if these are the responses to 20000 ppl murdered and you don't blink an eye about it

Edit: I've come to realize a lot of yall who practice your coping philosophy have some truly atrocious views. You don't care about nothing or no one. You just sit there all day and day ""I can't change this"" ""I can't control this"". Truly embarrassing.

Life is suffering,"It is my understanding that the Stoics, similar to the Buddhists, advocate accepting that there is a certain amount of suffering in life.  I believe the Buddhists even say that life **IS** suffering.  Instead of waiting and being put off kilter by life's obstacles, the Stoics advocate premeditatio malorum, a kind of meditation on the negativity that might come your way in a given day.

&#x200B;

I don't use that morning meditation every day.  I tend to remember it when things in my life are trending downward; that's when I'm usually grasping at whatever tools I have to make my life better.  I do find it useful.

&#x200B;

More importantly, for me, is the mere acceptance or acknowledgment that my life circumstances are exactly as they must be, warts and all.  I have some influence, but I cannot control them.   Life cannot be without suffering, so I need to accept it as it is. 

&#x200B;

Similarly too, both the Stoics and Buddhist believe that reality itself is neutral, in terms of its significance, but that it's our judgments about the reality that can cause us to suffer.  I am continually having to remind myself of this truth when I go down the rabbit hole of negativity.

&#x200B;

Being more accepting of life's struggles means less suffering  because I'm not constantly craving what isn't.

&#x200B;

I'm a novice student of Stoicism and Buddhism, so I would appreciate any comments that clarify or even correct what I'm trying to say.

"STOIC ADVISE (or anything else) FOR EMBRACING COMMITMENT AND STAY DETERMINED IN SOMETHING ""MEANINGFUL""","I was a really pathetic (and still am till date, but a bit better) until I started watching and reading Stoic philosophy. I am quite introverted and I am 10th standard. I am trying to come to the point: I don't know what I should achieve. My dad and other family members are putting too much hope on me to do something big. To be honest, I don't have any ambition in particular and I am a quite average guy.

I am quite overwhelmed and just want to live a simple, peaceful life. At the same time, I want to know that how exactly capable of doing particular stuff. To make it clear, I don't have any talent. So, I am not getting a single reason for self-improvement and having better days. I am too chill to be human! The worse part is that I suffer a lot from COGNITIVE DISSONANCE.

What is the point of this sub if not to help others?,"I’ve been on this sub for some time now and during my time here I’ve seen many including myself complain about posts seeking advice for their particular situation.

But what is the point of this sub if not to help others gain a better understanding of the philosophy through application and experience?

Something along those lines. Where’s the patience? 

I often need outside help because I’m burdened with social disorders that make it difficult for me to understand situations as they are as opposed to how I view them personally. And that’s often difficult for me to separate.

"What are the acceptable sources for ""personal merit""?","I've been reading Epictetus and he says "" 
Personal merit cannot be derived from an external source. It is not to be found in your personal associations, nor can it be found in the regard of other people. It is a fact of life that other people, even people who love you, will not necessarily agree with your ideas, understand you, or share your enthusiasms""

From my perspective, i am interested specifically in the first part talking about merit and he seems to me, to be talking about merit in regards to achievement or the desire for achievement. 

Epictetus lists all the sources NOT for personal merit.

Is there any advice from Epictetus or any other stoic greats regarding acceptable sources of obtaining ""personal merit""?

I am affected by what is currently happening in Gaza.,"I feel like nothing makes any sense anymore. How can people sleep comfortably knowing that their fellow human beings are experiencing genocide and children and innocent people are being killed? I feel guilty for having the privilege and resources to achieve my goals, for being able to buy meals, for having a roof over my head. I feel guilty about living. I am so sad for the people suffering and it's out of my control.

Just because I specifically mentioned Gaza doesn't mean I am not compassionate toward other races and countries too. What is wrong with some of you?

Why are you all assuming the other way? I DESPISE ALL FORMS OF EVIL. I am not siding with any side; I am against the people who are in charge behind all of this cruelty and those who support these actions.

Just because something worse happened in other countries doesn't mean we shouldn't stand up for other countries too. I don't know wtf happened to compassion. Why can't we all just be fvcking kind.

Being in your late teens and early 20s,"So, we get a very steady stream of posts here along the lines of “I’m 18-25 and I don’t know what to do with my life, don’t understand why I haven’t achieved anything yet, don’t understand why the world seems so bleak and pointless, etc”.

The reason is that you’re 18-25. That period of life is exactly when you question everything, as you come out of childhood and start to work out how to be an adult. This is, in short, a very normal way to feel and a very normal process to go through. 

Don’t be afraid. Let the questions present themselves and allow yourself time to find the answers. Very very VERY few people have things figured out at this stage. Be patient and calm, and allow yourself to be young and still learning. It’s ok not to know what you’re doing yet.

A Brief Gratitude for Stoicism,"I am from a developing country. If people from the developed world can be... well, untrustworthy, politically polarized, immature, horrible and so on, think developed world - economy and institutions and live with that for the rest of your life. I write this on every post in general so I think this has become essentially a part of my internet identity (and not my oh-so-glamorous IRL identity, unless I see discrimination here) 

So when I'm very grateful for Stoicism and the dichotomy of control. I've read and re-read original stoic texts countless times, with pencils and highlighting and all that good stuff. I would not claim I am an expert but if I've almost a decade of experience with 7 Habits of Effective People, I think I already have had a good introduction to Stoicism. Even the ""later"" stoics (big 3) abandoned stoic physics & stoic logic and just concerned themselves with stoic ethics (Discipline of Action) for the most part.

Stoicism as a school did not survive. But oh my god if we did not have the basic ability to focus on what is up to us (or ""control"") and did not have the ancient authors basically contributing to modern psychotherapy and science... I personally don't know how I'd deal with all the pressure and all my personal demons.

So thanks. I'm practically a first generation lawyer and hopefully will work as a District & Sessions judge before retirement. I think I'll never be called ""Justice <name>"" but that's perfectly fine. So, yeah, thank god for the good people behind stoicism and this sub. Even in this sub itself, things get pretty non-stoic and meta... but I think that's to be expected considering we're all humans and imperfect, like Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius and Cicero. 

So thank god for all the Stoic podcasts, authors, translators, and simply fellow students of this philosophy for sharing very good information with me. The first and foremost principle in Stoicism is the principle of Justice (a virtue) and personally I'd have gone crazy with my unorthodox lifestyle and unconventional life story if it weren't for Stoicism and related philosophies.

I have no idea how to handle my breakup.,"We broke up with my partner 2 months ago after 5 years of being together, and my life has been a living hell since then. I lost my job, had to move back in with my parents, I have no friends, everyone in my family is completely unavailable emotionally so I can’t turn to anyone for emotional support and the therapist I’ve been seeing isn’t much help either. (she’s a great person and she’s helped me with other things but I just don’t feel like it helps much with this) Meanwhile she started seeing someone else less than a week after we broke up, and she seems very happy without me in her life. I keep having intrusive thoughts imagining of her enjoying life with her current partner, doing things we used to do together, having sex, etc.

I rediscovered stoicism recently and tried to apply some stoic principles to my situation. I understand that my feelings of jealousy and betrayal come from a misunderstanding of reality. I don’t own or control this person, she is free to do whatever she wants and I should not base my happiness/life on her presence in my life. But I just can’t change how I feel. I also can’t treat this like a learning opportunity, or to become a better person, because I don’t want that.

It’s never possible for their victims to return to their  true selves. If by chance they ever ﬁ nd some respite, they still roll  restlessly, just like the deep sea, which still swells even after the wind  has settled; they never ﬁ nd full relaxation from their desires""



Q.1The way he said""It’s never possible for their victims to return to their  true selves""
I felt like it isn't possible even after they quoted the vices




""Look  back and recall when you were ever sure of your purpose; how few  days turned out as you’d intended; when you were ever at your own  disposal; when your face showed its own expression; when your mind  was free from disturbance; what accomplishment you can claim in  such a long life; how many have plundered your existence without  your being aware of what you were losing; how much time has been  lost to groundless anguish, foolish pleasure, greedy desire, the charms  of society; how little is left to you from your own store of time. You’ll  come to realize that you’re dying before your time.”

Ambition, luxury, greed, all look back to opinion.  it is according to opinion that we suffer.  Each man is as wretched as he has convinced himself he is.  Seneca, Epistles 78. 13.'""  When I first read this Stoic sentiment a couple years ago it was like an epiphany.  What do you mean that my/other's judgments about life and about me are not Truth.  They are just impermanent opinions holding no inherent value or weight.  That I somehow had the power to choose a different interpretation of the so-called facts was a revelation.

Prior to that, and other readings I was doing, I was so unconscious that I was often-times ensnared by my thinking, believing it was my reality (even when objective facts contradicted my thoughts); instead of being aware of the thinker, with the power to change my thoughts, or to not think at all, i.e., meditate or be mindful.

Should I forgive no matter what?,"Hello everyone, i’m relatively new to stoicism although I have been looking into stoic views for some time now. I am having trouble trying to decide the best course of action for my own mental and for my sports team regarding forgiveness of a teamate. A player on this sports team that I will call Jake brings down the entire team. Not just in a bad attitude towards the game way but in an instigator with his own teammates way. Jake and I were previously pretty close friends even spending some time together outside of our sport. Until Jake started being such a douche that I called him out for it. If you can’t tell yet, Jake isn’t the type of guy to appreciate being called out in front of his peers. We butted heads for many months but never let it affect us on the field. Recently it had gotten much worse as jake said cruel things to my face, gotten physical with me and my belongings/equipment, and tried to convince teamates I didn’t belong on the team. Now I am a pretty level headed guy, I didn’t let this affect me as I felt sorry for him because he is obviously lacking in some department to have to go after someone like this. What I refused to let happen was my image with others be tampered and for Jake to affect the chemistry of the team where it affects us in game play. During this period I looked at stoicism for guidance and I think I did the right thing. Not once did I raise my voice at Jake, lay my hands on jake, or even talk badly about jake to others. I reasoned that Jake is feeling a certain way and needs to take it out on others. 

Now I will skip some time and get to the part where i need advice. Jake came up to me personally and grabbed my hand shaking it and said “i’m sorry for being such a bad teammate, im working on it” I didn’t say “It’s okay” as being a bad teammate is not okay but i thanked him for his apology.

My criticism of Stoicism,"My criticism has to do with the emphasis that the ancient stoic sages gave to various virtues. Early stoicism was greatly influenced by Socratic piety and its virtue ethics of justice, temperance, courage, and wisdom. Aristotelian ethics also greatly influenced the stoics. Aristotle proposed the following nine virtues: wisdom, prudence, justice, fortitude, courage, liberality, magnificence, magnanimity, and temperance. 

Absent in these virtues and the stoic writings is the virtue of agape. This is a selfless, unconditional love that transcends romantic or familial love. This love is central to Christian theology. The core texts on this love are the sermon on the mount, attributed to Jesus, and the writing of the apostle Paul. 

A parallel to agape or “Christian love” can be found in eastern wisdom traditions as well. In Buddhism, especially the Theravada tradition, they emphasize Metta or the cultivation of boundless, unconditional love and goodwill toward all living beings.

Now the stoics did emphasize benevolence and kindness towards others, but the conception of agape is never a central part of the stoic ethic. I consider myself a novice practicing stoic, and have found that as I continue to learn and grow, my practice of virtue has been improved as I have worked to prioritize the development of agape.",Stoicism,1701914706.0,t3_18ckotn,0.69,6

Is resilience necessary?,"In a conversation here today, the idea of resilience was discussed and it was put to me that resilience is an important thing in Stoicism. I agreed at the time, but on reflection I wonder whether I was wrong. 

The word resilient has always suggested something springy to me, a surface which can be struck and bounce back, like a sapling or a good mattress. In humans, resilience is the ability to weather difficulty and recover from adversity. 

However, the Sage does not experience anything she considers adversity. Winds blow but they do not push her back. Correctly judging all circumstances, she has no need to be resilient because she experiences no suffering. 

Of course none of us are a Sage, but I wonder if resilience is the wrong thing for a student of Stoicism to strive towards. If we are affected enough to need resilience, presumably there is a flaw in our reasoning which needs to be addressed.

How did Epictetus earn money?," "" ""And how is it possible that a man who has nothing, who is naked,
houseless, without a hearth, squalid, without a slave, without a city,
can pass a life that flows easily?"" See, God has sent you a man to
show you that it is possible. ""Look at me, who am without a city,
without a house, without possessions, without a slave; I sleep on
the ground; I have no wife, no children; no praetorium, but only the
earth and heavens, and one poor cloak. And what do I want? Am I not
without sorrow? am I not without fear? Am I not free? When did any
of you see me failing in the object of my desire? or ever falling into
that which I would avoid? did I ever blame God or man? did I ever
accuse any man? did any of you ever see me with sorrowful countenance?
And how do I meet with those whom you are afraid of and admire? Do not
I treat them like slaves? Who, when he sees me, does not think that he
sees his king and master?"" "" 

This quote from the Discourses Book 3 Chapter 22: About Cynicism, makes me wonder...Epictetus loved Stoicism, was good at practicing it and teaching it, but how did he monetize it?",Stoicism,1701867952.0,t3_18c3knm,1.0,19
Choose not to be harmed—and you won’t feel harmed. Don’t feel harmed—and you haven’t been.,"I like this quote. I come back to it often. I wanted to know if I am applying it correctly after certain situations. 

For example. Every so often I will get into a negative confrontation which leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I tend to obsessive about things in gerneral. Be overly sensitive. Deem everything as a slight at times. I don't want to drone on but someone posted a post something like stoicism is not therapy or substitute for it. And it's not. Not for someone with add who hates to read it definitely won't be. But certain quotes like the one above really can make an impact. Now!! The point. 

Basically I went to a store I do deliveries for they know me. I asked the employee for an additional plastic bag to keep something warm. And he would just not want to do it. Said we can't? I challenged him. He didn't relent. I said I will pay for a freaking 2 cent bag. Still would not do it. Very infuriating, frustrating. Annoying. 

Is this one of those times this quote should be remembered??

Stoicism helps with depression,"
I will never make the claim that Stoicism is a tried and true ""cure"" to depression and/or suicidal ideation. However, I know that the lessons I personally have learned through philosophy as a whole, and Stoicism in particular, have helped me grow a lot in the last few months.

I have my low days still but I have learned how to face those thoughts and feelings from a far more practical view by changing my judgement. Every day I make the choice to allow those thoughts to run rampant or challenge them by seeing them ""for what they are"" as Marcus Aurelius put it. It's not necessarily that Stoicism cured me, it just gave me the tools to confront something I believed was bigger than myself for a long time. 

No amount of psych drugs or therapy can magically ""cure"" a person if they don't change their negative thought patterns and mindset. People who need help **should** seek it, and Stoicism has helped me and many others improve how they handle things.",Stoicism,1701871923.0,t3_18c4t0k,0.92,10

Stoicism is not a replacement for therapy.,"As the title says.

Stoicism is not a replacement for medical intervention. It can replace mental healthy therapy as much as it can replace physical therapy.

It can be an brilliant *companion* to medical intervention as you navigate recovery from any given problem, but it is not a replacement.

Remember, a stoic seeks to understand the world around us. To prioritise knowledge and wisdom above all else. 

There is a wealth of quality, validated research on mental health treatments.

The moment we reject the best established science in favour of *our own interpretation of a philosophy* is the moment we stop being rational, and start treating stoicism as a faith.

This is not just for the very large amount of people coming here seeking stoicism as a replacement for therapy, but directed at the far too many people encouraging using stoicism as a replacement for therapy.

The stoics once believed gravity was that objects are compelled to return to their natural resting point as an innate property of the object itself - A rock belongs on the floor so it is compelled to return there! A good stoic does not go ""No, Newton is wrong... it's not mass attracts mass"", so don't do it for medical science.",Stoicism,1701776416.0,t3_18ba5bk,0.95,517
Stoicism and art?,"Just finished Meditiations for the first time, and I could only find one brief passage about the relationship between Marcus and art. In one passage, can’t remember which one, MA mentioned music, and how if one were to break down a piece into each one of its notes, they could not affect him on their own. From this combined with Marcus telling himself to stop reading books, I infer that he does not believe that art is “good.” While Marcus did ‘cite’ several plays and literary works, this was the only passage I could find in direct relation to it so if someone can find more I would appreciate it.
Here is my core dilemma: I understand that one of the base precepts of stoicism is to not indulge in pleasures. To only seek clarity of the mind and to do the right thing for humanity, as your nature demands of you.  If this is the case, however, how does one justify the pursuit of beauty and art, or in our modern era entertainment such as movies and TV?",Stoicism,1701897873.0,t3_18ceo04,0.67,1
How (24m) to get over oneitis/crush (22f) that’s completely out of my league?,"So, I’ve \[24M\] had this intense crush on this woman \[22F\] for about 3 years now. I don’t know her personally, but we have some mutual friends and I’ve seen her at certain events here and there like house parties and such.

She’s so beautiful and pretty and I’ve been infatuated with her ever since I saw her. The problem is, is that she’s completely out of my league. She’s a well-known dancer in our community and has thousands of followers on her Instagram and TikTok. She’s super popular with many friends and a great social life, comes from a nice supportive family and rich background.

Meanwhile, there’s me, a 24-year-old loser virgin that’s still in university and living with his parents. I only have 3 friends and a lackluster social life. I have no relationship experience whatsoever due to my struggles with my mental health and abusive home situation that has held me back tremendously. I’m poor and broke and I have a lot of acne scars on my face that makes me really ugly. Not to mention I’m short as well.

Basically, I have no chance with her and I really want to accept that instead of constantly pining for her and stalking her Instagram. How do I get over this unrequited crush?

I lost all of my friends/they’ve kicked me out of our group. And it’s my fault. Where do I go from here?,"I’m 28 years old and two years ago, after being alone and without friends for my entire life, I finally acquired true friends. People that loved and accepted me and cared about me and all of that. For the first time in my life, I felt some sense of genuine joy and peace knowing I had them there. 

But, long story short, I said some things recently that they did not like and they decided to kick me out of the group (one of them even stuck their neck out for me before). So now I am back to zero and can feel a deeper depression coming on as well as a deep sense of regret and shame. But there’s no chance they’ll be bringing me back in anytime soon. I screwed up the only good thing I had and feel like a moron. 

The urge to take my life has escalated rapidly now and I don’t know what to do. How would a stoic deal in this situation?

ETA: Thank you to everyone who’s replied. You’ve given me a lot to think about. As for what exactly happened, it’d be too hard to explain and wouldn’t make much sense to those outside of my former friend circle.

Seneca - is there 20 books comprising letters to lucilius,"Hi 

So I'm reading letters of seneca and I have been fascinated by the legend and I thought of reading further more about him, 
I asked chat gpt how many books are there from seneca

And this was the output ! So is there actually each letters from penguin Classics are written in a bigger format as in 20 books? Or am I missing any information? 

Certainly! Seneca's ""Letters to Lucilius"" (Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium) are commonly organized into 20 books. Each ""book"" contains a set of letters, and in total, there are 124 letters. 

Here's a simplified breakdown of the organization:

Books 1-9: These books contain the majority of the letters, with each book consisting of a varying number of letters addressing different philosophical topics and life advice.Books 10-12: These books include letters on various subjects, continuing the themes of earlier books.

Books 13-16: These books are sometimes considered separately as ""On Groundless Fears,"" as they primarily focus on dealing with fears and anxieties.

Books 17-20: These books contain the final set of letters, exploring various Stoic principles and life lessons.",Stoicism,1701881816.0,t3_18c8e29,0.67,1

Stoicism can be a replacement for therapy,"Around my house I can fix things like leaky faucets and dead vacuums, but if a problem brings me close to electrical main lines I call an electrician. I'm happy to do it, but I'd never call him over to change a light bulb---it's faster, cheaper, better for me to do it myself. Some people are more handy than me and can build a house, others can't flip a breaker.

So it is with stoicism---and most moral philosophies---and mental health. Problems of the mind are the stuff of life; we all try to fix destructive behavior, figure out life goals, cope with grief, reconcile a traumatic event, and more. Sometimes the problem is small, sometimes it's big. A big problem faced by a young man whose seen little of the world and has no philosophy calls for talking to someone. A small problem faced by a woman steeped in a good philosophy is nothing for her to handle on her own. 

I've had my share of hardship, and stoic ideas often kept my mind right. Its not hard for me to think of a world where I hadn't pored over this philosophy and so found myself needing help.

For as long as I can remember, I’ve always known I would die young. Whether that be by nature, an accident or my own hands, I knew it was going to happen. I wasn’t a very lucky child. I had my first “sexual” experience at 5, with my two other male cousins. It was the turning point in my life. From then on it has been nothing but a downhill slope from there. I like to be around children and keep them happy and to make sure that nothing harms them. That they can stay their innocent and happy selves, wish someone would’ve had done that with me. Turns out from the three of us, I was the only one to develop feelings for guys even though it was never my idea nor did I like it. I’ve always felt dirty ever since then. From then on I consumed every food that caught my eyes because for some reason, that was what kept me from thinking about how “guilty” I felt.  I got older, fatter, yet always knew how to entertain a crowd. From 7-18 it was nothing but yo-yo diets, feeling insecure like any other teenager and simple unrequited crushes. I just kind of gave up then. Did I mention I am in the closet of an extremely homophobic, highly Christian-conservative household? Well I am. And even when I try to be careful I always make mistakes, that costs my family a lot (sometimes a lot of money too) I’m really sorry for that. I have a dream. Not that big of a dream but I had one. That one day, in my mid twenties I would move away to a foreign country, with a language I can not speak, preferably japan, and move to a quiet small beach town and just work at a cafe, free from anything, everyone. Somewhere where I can start all over again. Be clean. But that dream got crushed the moment I realized that I can move away from my situation,but I can never move away from my mind. This wasn’t a cry for help. Nothing can help me anymore. I love my family more than anything but I wish I could get murdered just so that they won’t face the pain of not truly knowing what storm laid inside my heart which made me wanted to kill myself. Maybe this story lands somewhere with someone who’s struggling with the same things maybe my story that didn’t have such a happy ending could mean the world to someone’s who could.

1. Averse to bus being late (As usual)
2. Seeing something triggering memory of wife (Breakup Recently - Don't wanna cry)
3. Speaking about Wife (As above)
4. Not enough table's to set up required event (Work)
5. That during my Mental Health assessment the assessor would think I'm mental and report me
6. The Bus Home from work leaves early (As usual)

My list of What is in my Complete Control preceding my aversions

1. Getting up early enough
2. My own choice to ruminate
3. Not to stalk her social media
4. Speaking honestly about my mental health to the assessor
5. Left it blank here I did 
6. Checking the bus times and live tracking

The issues I had trying to apply stoic principles,"This year I started my stoic journey and I've been enjoying it so far. I feel better overall, but the thing I like the most about stoicism is that I have guidance or some sort of ""framework"" on how to behave on any given situation, which facilitates making tough decisions.

One issue I struggled with for some time is knowing what would be ""the stoic way"" to handle certain scenarios I faced in my life. And this was an issue for two reasons:

1. I would have to search for a specific teaching/quote/insight on stoic books that would relate to the situation I'm going through. This is not easy since most stoic books (at least the most popular ones) aren't structured in an organized way. They're mostly just a bunch of teachings with no particular order or association to a specific subject.
2. Once I found some quote or teaching, it was hard to clearly understand the underlying message. I'm kind of new to philosophy, so most times the language used was difficult for me to understand.

So I ended up building an app that would help me with that. I'm not intending to do self-promotion so I wont share any particular details, but I imagine if its helping me now, it can potentially help others.

So I would like to know what people practicing Stoicism think about the concept and what I could do to make it useful to others, so I can share it through the appropriate channels.

It works as follow:

1. You enter some situation you're going through your life. Could be anything, from minor things that happen on your day-to-day to more meaningful situations that affect your overall wellbeing.
2. The app scan through a set of stoic books looking for quotes or teachings that relate to your scenario.
3. Using AI, the app display's the following:
   1. The quote extracted from the books, exactly as it was taken from the source.
   2. The quote explained in plain english. No complex or ancient language, the quote is explained as a friend would explain it to you.
   3. An explanation of how a stoic would handle the situation you're going through. Everything based on the quote mentioned in point no. 1.

# Example

**My scenario:**

*I'm working on expanding my social circle and building meaningful friendships. It's not easy for me to connect with new people and maintain those relationships since I'm very shy*

**The quote taken from books:**

*Judge no speech or action unworthy of you which is consistent with nature. Be not dissuaded by any consequent criticism or censure from others; but, if the speech or action be honourable, judge yourself worthy to say or do it. Those who criticize you have their own conscience and their own motives. These you are not to regard, but follow a straight course, guided by your own nature and the nature of the Universe, both of which point the same way.*

**The quote explained:**

Do not let the opinions or criticisms of others discourage you from pursuing actions that are in line with your own nature and the nature of the Universe. If your intentions are honorable, consider yourself worthy of engaging in those actions or expressing those thoughts. The judgments and motives of others should not influence your decisions, as they have their own perspectives and motivations. Instead, stay true to yourself and follow the path that aligns with your nature and the greater order of the Universe.

**The quote in the context of my scenario:**

In your scenario of expanding your social circle and building meaningful friendships, it is important to remember that you should not let the shyness or potential criticism from others deter you from connecting with new people. The quote emphasizes that you should not judge your own actions or words as unworthy simply because they may be met with criticism or disapproval. Instead, if your intentions are genuine and honorable, you should consider yourself worthy of making the effort to connect with others and build meaningful relationships. The opinions and judgments of others should not hinder your pursuit of social connections, as they have their own perspectives and motivations. Stay true to your own nature and the natural inclination for human connection, and do not let external factors discourage you from taking action.

Initially I was so excited and wanted to share it with the people in my life but then this anxiety set in. I feel bad celebrating when there are people in my life going through hardships. It’s hard for me to enjoy these good things when I know people are suffering.

"Genuinely curious, why should I live if no one can love me","I don’t have a single friend. They all abandoned me for various reasons or they betrayed me. I always was treated like an option or just a background character. Never treated like a *friend*. I’ve never had a boyfriend or a girlfriend before because I am physically unattractive. I’m 24 and female. My relationship with my immediate family has been diminishing since I’ve been completely alone for years. 

I’ve never felt proper love. I’ve been alone, ignored, treated like shit by nearly everyone around me, stranger or not. I can’t make friends, but either way, I don’t really want to because I can’t trust or tolerate anyone anymore after being alone for so long. No one understands that my life is over, there is no hope or “right people” for me. It’s either gas myself (I already have a suicide plan) or live the rest of my life alone, depressed and struggling. No one wants to be around me, no matter what I do no one wants to be my friend and no one wants to be with me because I’m ugly. And no, this is not going to change. Despite what people say, no it doesn’t get better or change. It doesn’t matter what I’ve done, I’ve never won socially. 

I’ve met so many people and befriended them. Only for a temporary time. And I’m still completely alone. My personality is bitter and angry, nothing can change that. My life is truly over and no. Like I said. It’s not going to change. I’ve been like this since I left high school. 

Why should I live? I don’t know anyone else, online or irl in the same situation. Sure, they may not have ever had a parter, but they have friends. Or vice versa. But no one has neither except me.

Core precepts/values and virtues - clarification please,"Bear with me here as I may be using the terms incorrectly.

Epictetus advised us to have core precepts to guide us in our daily lives.

Let's say we choose things such as: Being mindful and intentional. Staying in our power (not letting others sway us); being disciplined etc

Is the assumption correct that the virtues Temperance, Wisdom, Courage, Justice aren't core values as such but are what underpin our core values? Therefore the virtues are the foundations that help us with our core values?

Stoicism Vs. Unconditional Forgiveness,"There’s a man named Cliffe Knechtle, a pastor. I came across a video of his which speaks on “forgiveness” and if it has limits. I wanted to make an attempt to respond to how I *think* a practicing stoic would. I would love the insight of others, and the assistance with realigning wherever I may fall short. 

Interviewer: “When does God say “No more, I can’t forgive you for this.”?

Cliff: “I used to work in a prison at Lawrence Massachusetts. Every monday night I would go there, and I first would go into the cell of a man in protective custody who kidnapped little boys, sexually abused him, and murdered him. And after being with him I would go into the basketball gym to play basketball with the other inmates and they would come up to me and say, “Cliffe how can you even talk to such a piece of dirt, don’t you know what he did?” And I say, “Yes I do know what he did, pretty horrendous, pretty grotesque, pretty evil, but he still is a human being created in the image of God, and god offers him forgiveness as horrible as that is. Now there’s a part of me that doesn’t like that, cause I’ve never kidnapped little boys, sexually molested him and murdered him, so I think I’m better. No unfortunately I’m not better, Because in my own sophisticated erudite way I have rebelled against God. I am in desperate need of God’s Grace, his forgiveness, and for me to look down on a guy like that and and say, “Oh, you’re just so inferior, you’re just a piece of dirt” No, he’s a human being created in the image of God, that image has been horribly defaced, horribly, but he still is a human being created in the image of God and God offers him forgiveness.”

- The man in question kidnapped, molested and murdered little boys. This in itself is considered an indifference/external. So, it’s how we use what has happened that is ‘good’ or ‘bad’. ‘Good’ would be to lock this person up or prevent them from doing what they’ve done again in any way possible. ‘Bad’ would be to *not* prevent this person from doing what they’ve done again, in whatever way possible. 

- If we were in a position to choose whether to speak to the criminal, or to…*not* speak to them, the choice is dependent on whether or not doing so would be an act of virtue, with virtue being assigned to what is dependent on our will. If this is the case, then the decision on whether we speak to him or not makes no difference, but how we act within each choice *does* make the difference. If we decided to speak to him, what would be the virtuous way to do so? 

“*You say, “Philosophers talk paradoxes” But are there no paradoxes in the other arts? and what is more paradoxical than to puncture a man’s eye in order that he may see? If anyone said this to a man ignorant of the surgical art, would he not ridicule the speaker? Where is the wonder then if in philosophy also many things which are true appear paradoxical to the inexperienced?*” Epictetus, Discourse 1.25 “On the Same”. 

Based on this quote, I’ve concluded that if I listened to my impression then yes, I would choose not to speak to him because doing so would be bad. However, if my purpose in speaking with the criminal was to learn about why he did it and to prevent it from occurring again, then it would be the right way to act. If I chose to speak to him only to remind him of how shitty of a person is and throw insults at him, this would be *bad* because I am harming my own character by doing this. —— The inexperienced in this case would be the prisoners that question why Cliff even speaks to the man. (?)

-  “*Now there’s a part of me that doesn’t like that, cause I’ve never kidnapped little boys, sexually molested him and murdered him, so I think i’m better. No unfortunately I’m not better, because in my own sophisticated erudite way I have rebelled against God*”. It seems that within Christianity, Rebelling against God = acting without virtue. At least, if our decision to think “I’m better than this guy” leads us to act without virtue, then it is bad. So, am I better than this child, Lester? The truth is: It doesn’t matter. 

- Finally, forgiveness. Would I/Should I forgive? Well, it’s not even my place to forgive. This would be desiring what belongs to others which is a no no. If it WERE my place to forgive (ex. I’m the child that was murdered), whether I forgive or not is…no?

Suppressing emotions,"Hey there,
Am 17 and I am relatively new to stoicism I had lot of trouble while traveling the journey of life,
The problem is that I feel like,I am emotionally weak at times I can't control my anger.whenever I feel angry.I try to control myself but there are times when I have meltdowns whenever I supress my angry for way too long(happens rarely tho).there was this kid from  my class whose bigger than me usually makes fun of me(dudes a bully) most of the time around my classmates,one day we got into an argument and I never were good at arguments,
So I started throwing hands with him and I somehow managed to knock the dude out with a single scratch but even tho I felt sense of happiness after that,later on post realisation hit me like a truck after realising the collatral damage I have created(I accidentally hurt my friends who were trying to seperate us).even tho he was the one who started all of this mess,i apologised to everyone present there.whenever I let my anger control myself I have no memories of the event also I could have accidentally severly injured the guy if I choked him any longer

So I don't want anger to control myself there were many instances similar to this.i always try my best not to cause any trouble and I try my best to avoid being angry at people.but unfortunately I get into fights way often considering how emotionally unstable I am and my mom asked what would happen if I accidentally kill someone if I let my anger control me(as there were similar events just like this)and the question still revolves in my head.

There are also instances were i cry infront of people which I feel is embarassing.how can I come to peace with myself and I know for a fact violence is never a solution",Stoicism,1701699391.0,t3_18al487,0.7,4
How can one be virtuous if they have a bad moral compass,"Hi all, 

I have been practicing Stoicism for a couple years now but have a question regarding the philosophy which I can’t figure out (probably due to my inexperience/knowledge) The philosophy is more broadly a practical one rather than theoretical one, and encourages people to learn through experience rather than pure study, ‘waste no time arguing what a good man should be. Be one’ 

How does this work if you have an objectively bad moral compass but don’t realise it, I.e. think you are doing the right thing, but are actually causing more harm to people than good, but in your eyes you are practicing stoicism.

How to overcome severe emotional and physical suffering alongside chronic pain,"I (19M) have been through multiple rough patches in my life. To summarize, I struggled with bullying and loneliness as a child. My home country is going through a civil war, and my father has lost all his life savings and our family's wealth and committed suicide after I tried to stop him (but clearly didn't do enough). So, at the mere age of 16, my family fell apart, and we became semi-broke. Add that to the grief of my losing my father and the trauma from the event. This was during COVID-19, so the physical isolation did not really help.

But, throughout all of this, I still managed to succeed in school and gained admission to a top university in the US with a full scholarship. Being the oldest son, I was always the one expected to perform, and I always had a goal of giving back to my mother. During my time at university, I also managed to get a great GPA and pursued multiple internships throughout my summers and during the semesters. I had a carefully crafted plan to reach my goals, and I was determined to succeed despite everything.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Fast forward to the beginning of my most important semester yet, the one where I have to apply for my junior internships and the one where I have to take the hardest yet most important courseload. I started developing pain in my testicles; being the diligent person I am, I saw a specialist the next day of that happening. I got prescribed antibiotics, yet after completing a course of 3 weeks, the pain never went away. But I was determined not to let this pain stop me from pursuing my goals. A month later, after being in constant pain and going to 3 different doctors, I started having pain in my right testicle; this pain was excruciating. I immediately went to the ER, where they conducted imaging and lab tests and concluded nothing was wrong, so I was sent on my way. But the pain never really subsided. After countless ER and specialist visits, I was found to have a blood clot in my right-sided scrotum, which is apparently so rare only 25 cases have been previously documented. I took my meds, but the constant pain never really went away. It seems the condition is ""resolved,"" i.e., they can't find the clots anymore. But here I am left with a constant pain that often turns excruciating over the course of 4 months with no doctor seeming to help and hope of relief in the future.

&#x200B;

I couldn't apply for internships, and my academics suffered greatly to the point where I started failing classes; I am now experiencing severe depression and chronic pain. My body is always tired and fatigued. I can't help but think of my friends and colleagues who are all leading everyday nice lives, and some of whom are succeeding in the way I dreamt and worked so hard to achieve.

I now live alone and practically isolated, away from family, severely depressed, bedridden, and in chronic pain. My life fell apart, and I have lost my dreams and goals.

How would a stoic approach this predicament? How can I train my mindset to continue pushing through these problems?

No freedom in life.," 

I dont want to bore y'all with details, so in short, I am 19F. My mother doesn't give me much freedom to go outside home alone unless its college/work. This lack of autonomy has resulted in a pretty boring life, and zero life outside academics. It gets quite mundane, but my thoughts entertain me. However, a time frequently comes where I have reject my friends' invitations to outings/meetups/malls/college programs, etc and that's when I realize that I have no liberty in my life, causing emotional pain and pity like no other. Its been years now, I believe I should be used to it.

There's isn't much I can do about it either, I have tried reasoning things out multiple time and it doesn't end well. I can only move out at 24-25 (Our culture doesn't allow moving out either but I have a plan figured out). Logically it is easy to convince myself that I can't do much about it but it doesn't ease the emotional pain, specially when I have relive this while explaining to situations to friends, or think of the memories I could have made.

The only thing I end up doing is distracting myself from pain by social media or video games. I see no other way out.

“The true man is revealed in difficult times. So when trouble comes, think of yourself as a wrestler whom God, like a trainer, has paired with a tough young buck. For what purpose? To turn you into Olympic-class material.” Epictetus

“What would have become of Hercules, do you think, if there had been no lion, hydra, stag or boar – and no savage criminals to rid the world of? What would he have done in the absence of such challenges? Obviously he would have just rolled over in bed and gone back to sleep. So by snoring his life away in luxury and comfort he never would have developed into the mighty Hercules.” Epictetus

What I’m saying is, giving the response of “it’s not in my control” isn’t an all encompassing response to difficulty. The message that so many miss. Mainly the dichotomy of control isn’t just about recognizing what is external or internal so you can disregard uncontrollable events, it’s about recognizing what you can/need to take action on.

But I made a lot of sacrifices to come here, I was used to having dozens of friends, now I have like two, my girlfriend of one year and a half broke up with me because I decided to go and take care of my family and a long distance was ""too much"" for her despite me being willing to make a 1100km trip just to see her every month.

"Logos, the mind, and change","**TLDR**:

If you're dissatisfied with your circumstances and you want to change your dissatisfaction, you have to change either your reasoning process to change your judgements about your circumstances, the circumstances themselves, or a combination of both. The rest of the title is only ~~for the nerds~~ a click-bait.

**Full post**:

I’ve noticed a common pattern in advice posts where the posters ask how to be content about a situation in life they’re obviously dissatisfied with, yet they insist on changing neither their desire nor their situation. Typically they mention doing Stoic “practices” such as “acceptance of fate”, “negative visualisation”, “dichotomy of control”, etc.

In this post I will try to explain why none of these “practices” by themselves have any causal effects on contentment by relating to the concept of Logos and the Stoic theory of the mind.

***Logos***

Logos is defined as “the rational principle governing the universe” ([source](https://iep.utm.edu/stoicism/#SH2b)). The word “rational” here means explainable, consistent, causal, and deterministic. In other words the opposite of true random chance. Note that the ancients didn’t come up with the abstract concept “rational” and looked for things existing in the universe that they could apply this concept on. It’s the other way around – they observed that things existing in the universe follow a causal pattern and they described the phenomenon as “rational”.

This “rational” characteristic of the universe is what allows us to thrive using our “rational” mind. We are the only animal species that’s capable of comprehending this “rationality” permeating throughout the universe and using it to our advantage.

It might be difficult to wrap your head around this concept because it’s the only observable universe    we have access to. To understand what an “irrational” universe would be like, consider these thought experiments:

* What if gravity switches between pulling and pushing completely randomly?
* What if fire switches between generating and absorbing heat completely randomly?
* What if the Earth changes its shape between sphere, cubicle, pyramid, flat, cylinder, etc completely randomly?

When you consider these possibilities you will see how impossible it is for us humans the way we are now to live in such a universe.

Personally I prefer to understand Logos as a combination of mathematical rules (as opposed to linguistic rules) and natural laws (as opposed to man-made laws).

***The*** ***mind***

The ancient Stoics believed that the mind was purely physical ([source](https://iep.utm.edu/stoicmind/#SH2a)). Scholars haven't reached an agreement on whether this means strictly what we now call “[materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism)” or something else entirely. Regardless of what this belief should be called, they agree the Stoics believed the mind is a thing that is made up of physical materials and thus follows the physical laws of the universe.

What this means is the mind isn’t only capable of comprehending the “rationality” of the universe, it operates based on the same “rational” principle itself. The short version of the Stoic theory of mind in relation to this principle is as follow:

* We perceive external stimuli in the form of perceptions.
* We combine these perceptions with our existing beliefs (which by themselves are formed through the same “rational” principle) to form judgements (or also called impressions).
* Our emotions are a result of these judgements. Some think emotions are how the mind perceive the judgements (or how the judgements “feel”), some think they are caused by the judgements, some others think they are side-effects (or by-products) of judgements. In any case there is an inseparable link between our judgements and emotions.

There is much more to the Stoic theory of the mind but for the purpose of this post this short description will suffice. The important lesson we want to take from this is that our judgements and emotions are caused by the application of our reasoning process when combining our perceptions of reality with our existing beliefs.

***Change***

With the knowledge of how the mind works in Stoicism, the question that follows is how do we change our emotions? Given that emotions are caused by 2 factors (or variables): our beliefs and the facts about reality (our circumstances), it logically follows that our emotions will change if and only if there are changes in those factors.

As a software engineer, when I learned about the Stoic theory of mind I immediately related it to how I have always approached my software. The software is programmed in a certain way (my beliefs), this programming reflects my understanding of the business requirements, the programming operates on fundamental mathematics and logic (Logos). Given a set of input (circumstances) the software always produces the same set of output (emotions). If the output doesn’t match my expectation (a bug in software engineering terms), then I will proceed to think about whether I should change my input or my programming, or both (sometimes I also change business requirements, but that also falls under changing my ""beliefs"").

If you can’t relate to my software analogy, try to think of it like a mathematical function f(x) = y, where:

* f denotes a transformation function which contains formulas (beliefs), which adhere to mathematical laws (logos) such as commutative, associative, distributive, and so on.
* x is a variable (circumstances).
* y is the result of transforming x with the function f (emotions).

This means if you want a different result, let’s call y’, you have to change either the input to x’, or the function to f’, or again both.

If it’s still hard to relate, let’s try another analogy. Suppose you want to get inside a room behind a closed door. You turn the knob clockwise. You pull it inwards and it doesn’t open. At this point you can try one of the followings if you still want to get inside the room:

* Turn the knob anti-clockwise.
* Push the door outwards.
* Assert if it’s possible that the door is locked from the inside, if so:
   * Is there a keyhole, and if so where is the key?
   * Is there an alternative way to get inside the room without going through that door (is there a side entrance, a window with which you can climb into the room, and so on)?
* ~~Kick it open.~~

In summary, the point I’m trying to make with this post is that if you feel a certain way about something and you want to change how you feel, then you have to change something that directly contributes to how you feel about it, be it your beliefs or the thing itself.

Structure of Courage. Structure of Action. Structure of the Hero (as in the Hero's Journey).,"Not a newbie here. I have been hanging out this sub, reading the [*classics*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/wiki/resources#wiki_recommended_books_for_newcomers_to_stoicism) as well the new Stoics like Massimo for about a couple of years now. 

I consider myself a Stoic practitioner, not perfect, but Stoic nonetheless.

I write. I write a lot, I have been writing all my life. More recently, I have been thinking/writing about the Archetype of the Hero's Journey, about taking Action, and about Courage.  To me these three concepts are all interconnected, intertwined, correlated and causative.

Today I am stuck with coming up with the *structure* of Action and/or the *structure* of Courage. They might be the same.

I apologize for seeming a bit cryptic, but what is the stance of Stoicism when it comes to Action? And when it comes to Courage?

We aren’t designed for this world of pleasure,"The world we live in allows us to feel some kind of pleasure all day long if we want that. It can almost be considered a revolution in what we are going through. Yes it’s the technological revolution but now we are starting to see the effect it has on our dopamine levels. Before technology we would seek pleasure in real things such as finding a partner, pursuing a career, being social, playing sports, taking in nature but most of us today would rather stay inside and play video games then actually pursue something real.

What do you understand about Stoicism in current times?,"Hello everybody!

I’m currently researching Stoicism and considering how it transfers to modern times/ to what extent people apply it now.

My two questions for you are (without going to research, just your personal take from the top of your head):

1. What do you understand about Stoicism/ Stoic teaching?—Even if it’s very little (e.g. you saw a Stoic quote on social media once)

2. How, if applicable, do you apply it in your own life?—Do you think of it as entirely realistic and achievable, or do you struggle with it at times?

This will be posted across a few subreddits to reach a wider variety of people. No matter the extent of your experience with Stoicism, do not be afraid to offer a reply! All responses will be appreciated.

Thank you,

How to reconcile this?,"Stoicism says you can only control your internals like your own thoughts, actions & reactions.

But are we truly in control of our thoughts & actions? Our actions at any given moment are influenced by so many factors like our general upbringing, our traumas, desires, aversions, our surrounding environment, our biological disposition  & many more and most of these factors are beyond our control. 

Same goes for our thoughts.

Then how am I really in control of my thoughts and actions?

Even me stumbling upon ideas of stoicism wasn't in my control. One day Youtube decided to recommend me a video of stoicism and that point I was in a mood to watch a self help video.

So at best Stoicism can be an emotion management tool which requires many perceptual adjustments to really internalize it in one's life.

Struggling with sexual desire and buying sex,"Although sex is a normal thing, as a single virgin 28M am struggling with it. Ideal solution would be to have a stable relationship with someone, and i can do it if i pursue. But i come from a conservative background where my parents won't accept it. I have been seeing a few woman online chat/call upon their recommendation, but i live in abroad (in a more liberal society), so the communication gap with the other people matters a lot. I have been away from my family over 5 years. I do need physical affection and love and hug in this single life (friends are not enough). I don't see myself getting married soon, and i have been seriously considering buying instead of wasting my 20s youth time just like that. Can’t deny that this sex drive may have affected my work. Ethically i am against porn and trafficking. But i am not sure what would be of me if i buy sex. In the end, i don't think i will find any open-minded woman who will accept my ""past sex-buying"" experience.

I think male sex drive is uniquely high. We can disregard it focusing on productive works, but that never vanishes the urge. The urge is like a pitfall, you will fall to it naturally if you roam near it, if the atmosphere provokes yourself. Then how do i confront this hidden energy?

I'm afraid of losing my income. How do I redirect my thoughts?,"I know that it's outside of my control, regardless of how hard I work and perform, I could still lose my income.

My problem is that I feel that this fear is preventing me from applying to other companies because I start imagining scenarios where I wouldn't fit in and get fired from that new company.

I'm considering applying to other companies because
(1) the commute could be better
(2) I could probably earn more
(3) I feel like I will never be promoted at this company, as my application was rejected twice already in the past two years.

So, then I start rationalizing how my one hour commute is not that bad, how my salary is relatively decent and that I don't want to take on more responsibilities and lose little work-life balance I have.

Should I not fix it, if it ain't broke? Is there an alternative approach? Or is it simply about having more courage and embrace the possibility that the new job would suck and/or I could lose my income?",Stoicism,1701572268.0,t3_189jwiv,0.7,5
Is stoicism working for you?,"Don't know when you guys realized that stoicism is really helping you, but for me it clicked when I realized a few years ago that I was no longer overly afraid to die. 

&#x200B;

I used to struggle with the idea that I was sick with something, any tiny symptom that I had I would think I had some sort of bad cancer. Practicing negative visualization in the beginning helped me big time with that, only 10 minutes every morning, but making it a routine. It helped me understand that during the day when any negative thought came I didn't need to think about, I could simply talk myself into waiting for tomorrow's session. I realized I was becoming a much less anxious person, to the point now that I have to, for example, to do the opposite and force myself to go to the doctor to have some regular checkups, otherwise I won't even bother.

&#x200B;

It's still not perfect though, I still struggle at work, for example, to keep it cool when I'm confronted with something, when my boss does something I don't like... I still let this kind of stuff get to me. Even though it is a little better, I still see this as a big area of improvement. I can't for example receive an email that triggers some reaction on me, put it on my to do list, and carry on with the next task. I keep thinking about it until I reply it, and sometimes my answer is not the greatest as I'm still emotional when I reply to it.

&#x200B;

Obviously I know I will never be a sage, there are some areas where you excel, others that you find more difficult, but after 5 years practicing stoicism, I can say that it really helps me big time, and it completely changed my life for the best. It gave me tools to deal with frustrations and difficulties, and I'm grateful even for the simple fact that it made me think about how I behave, ways I could improve myself to make my life and my loved ones better.

Embarking on 'Our Journey of Self-Improvement and Collaboration,"I find myself at a juncture in life where cultivating virtues has become imperative. I've taken strides in developing habits, yet maintaining consistency and identifying my shortcomings prove challenging. In light of this, I am eager to propose the formation of a mastermind group focused on self-improvement and Stoicism. Through mutual support, we can collectively address our growth areas. This collaborative effort, along with staying committed to our goals as a team, promises not only personal benefits for each of us but also the nurturing of collaboration skills and character traits. Let's work together on our self-development to make a positive impact on ourselves and the world.

"""In the void is Virtue, and no evil""_Miyamoto Musashi","I've long felt that there were alot of similarities between Miyamoto Musashi's Infinite Success and Marcus Aurelius' Meditations. Maybe it's because of ""take up the attitude of the sun"" and ""to watch the courses of the stars as if you revolved with them"". Lines that standout for me in both books and to me appear to be talking about the exact same thing in the exact same way. Musashi while talking about the void in that book says ""..it is where there is nothing...it is not contained in man's knowledge."" I guess i feel like the body of knowledge of Stoicism is incomplete (I wouldn't know, I haven't read every Stoic text ever written)because of the absence of sages among us everyday. But someone wrote a comment on  here sometime that made me think Stoic Sages are all around us, but we would never know they are here because they are doing their job well.(Like the Oracle when she tells Neo, that there are programs running all over the place, programs to control the sun, the wind, and that the one's doing what they were meant to do, we would never know they are were here). To get to the void Musashi writes that ""..polish the two fold spirit heart and mind"", for which Stoicism as I've come to know it is the best substance for that. And to ""..sharpen the twofold gaze perception and sight"", which to me means understanding the origin of my mother tongue(Luganda). Origin as in which visual element in nature is associated with which sound in my mother tongue, and why.",Stoicism,1701539637.0,t3_18993g0,0.89,15
Does Stoicism Accept Suicide?,"Julius Caesar ended him. George Washington wanted to be like him.

Cato The Younger, the most Stoic of the Stoics, decided to die instead of living under a dictator.

But was his death against Stoicism's main idea?

Cato, when he realized Julius Caesar was going to win the war and become the sole ruler of Rome, went to his room.

There, with the noises of fighting men and death clouding his ears, he sat down to read some Plato.

Soon after, the time had come.

Cato took his sword and stabbed himself in the stomach deep enough to feel it, but not deep enough to kill him.

When his son and some of his soldiers entered the room, they found Cato hurt and bloody but not dead.

So they did what any good son and ally would do: they tried to save him.

But then, Cato did the unthinkable.

He was so committed to his cause, or so blinded and confused (I'll get to that in a second), that he disemboweled himself.

In plain English, Cato used his hands to take out his own guts and ensure certain death.

Not only is this a horrific way to die, but it also raises big questions.

Sure, I'm with Cato: this needs balls. To stand against a dictator and show your opposition with works, not words.

But why doesn't anyone comment on the fact that Cato went against Stoicism's most important idea: The Dichotomy of Control?

The fact that Julius Caesar was going (he didn't) to become Rome's ruler was out of Cato's or anyone's control.

Shouldn't Cato, as a Stoic, have accepted this course of events and done the best with what was given to him?

Of course, this brings new questions:

1. What if Caesar killed him? From historical references, Cato and Caesar did no hate each other. But I get that Cato would prefer to die out of his own hands.
2. The Stoics, and Cato as well, viewed life and death as indifferent. So they were fine with one ending one's life, only if the situation demanded it (sacrifice for the common good) or if their life was unbearable.

Detachment vs effort,"I'm making my way though Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus and reading a lot about the detachment from things we can't control. To me it sounds really similar to themes in Christianity and Buddhism and I really appreciate it and think this is a great way to live through adversity.

My quandary and the issue I have in applying it to my life has to do with the disconnect between detachment and creative effort. Despite being content with anything, stoics, I assume, still strive for things other than contentment? There is an imperative to ""live in accordance with nature/reason/God."" There is (even though the texts don't talk about it frequently) positive things we ought to do? Say I'm a husband and father (I am). Isn't it in keeping with stoicism that I provide for my family? Let's say I'm struggling to do that. I think the common stoic advice is to focus on the effort that I apply in this regard and accept that ultimately success is outside of my control. The idea is that I control my actions and not my situation.

The problem with that is it's only true in philosophy world. You absolutely DO have control over your success even if that control is partial and success can't be guaranteed. We are intelligent creatures and opportunities for creative solutions to our problems abound. The world is full of stories of people who thought their way out of difficult situations. Ok, but the stoics do say you can make the attempt so what's the issue? 

The issue is that trying to try isn't trying. One can only fully engage in difficult creative problem solving if they believe that the solution is within their control and they are attached to the outcome. No Olympic winner was just trying to try his best. They were trying to win. The investment in the outcome is necessary for the effort. I know from personal experience how much less likely I am to solve a technical problem I encounter if I think it might not have a solution. This is the opposite of the stoic advice which emphasizes acceptance of fate.

Confused about stoic view of love.,"I understand the logic behind how stoics say we should treat and view our relationships with our loved ones, as they are obviously not ours to possess and they can be taken away by circumstances, death or by their own choice. However, I still have a bit of a bone to pick with this attitude, as to my eyes it makes light of and minimizes the value of personal connections. If I am not attached to my brother or my child and they die, and I am not shaken or disturbed by their loss due to my lack of attachment, then did I truly love them? To me it seems like the pain of losing a loved one (whether to death, distance, a breakup, etc.) is not a bug or a problem of being too attached or possessive, but rather a simple proof of your love and value they had in your life. 

In short, if you aren't devastated at the loss of your child, did you really love them as a parent should love their child? If you lose something you value and it doesn't hurt, did you really value the thing you lost?",Stoicism,1701446105.0,t3_188f88g,0.93,13

My question is that what difference does it make if nature is rational and providential? How does that add to the argument that nature commands us to live in obedience to reason and designed us to gravitate towards virtue?

Advice On Moving Out and Possibly Coming Out to Religious Family,"Hi there, I'm a 21 Y.O. male from the UK, and would like some advice when it comes to moving out from my family home and living independently.

I'm in a bit of a tough situation, as my parents and family are aware of my apathetic attitude towards Islam. They know that they'll have to continually force me to wake up for morning prayer, they know that most of my friends are non-Muslim and they know that me moving out could only mean that I'm looking to distance myself from them and the religion.

I know many others who've managed to gain independence once they've moved out for university, but since I've been working from home ever since I left high-school at 18, I've never been able to use the excuse that I'm looking to move out for work related reasons. They'll only accept me moving out once I've found a wife.

This is why I feel forced to come out to them and tell them that I'm no longer a Muslim, for the sake of my own sanity. I'm not sure what the best approach is when it comes to telling them I'm moving out, or that I'm no longer a practicing Muslim. I've accepted that my family would most likely disown me, but I find it hard not to feel responsible for the pain that I'm causing them.

Correct me if im wrong but stoicism is a way to think about the world and your place in it. What it is not is a  sound system for dealing with the complex emotions of depression, thoughts of suicide or any other extreme mental health issues.

What are some stoic principles I can have for having difficulty learning new things,I started a new job at the beginning of this month and it’s been going well for the past week or so but the first couple of weeks were very challenging. There is a lot to learn and I’ve always become frustrated when I can’t figure things out soon after starting them. I’ve tried to tell myself that things take time and everyone at the workplace was in the same position as me at one point in time but I have a hard time being kind and forgiving to myself because I have a lot of negative talk in my head.

the thoughts are winning this week and I feel like I wanna disappear just to see how others will react,"I've struggled with depression and loneliness for years, it comes and goes in waves.

This past week its all coming back full force. The morning car ride to work is filled with these ""what ifs,"" the car ride home is the same, and I spend half my night just fantasizing about how others will react, if they even care, or even what I would write on a note and who I would mention kinda thing. Who I would thank, who I would ignore...

I dont really plan on doing it, but I cant help but fantasize about it.

The very worst part is that I have a bunch of people that seem to truly really care about me. I dont feel it much from my parents or brother, they're a very ""buh tough love"" type bullshit, but I feel it from my friends and even coworkers. Kinda sad that I feel closer and more accepted and cared for from my coworkers than my own family but it is what it is.

I have friends that reach out and invite me to things, I know they'd care. There are a few coworkers that would care.

But I keep having these doubts and insecurities about it. I always seek reassurance and even when I get it I still have trouble accepting it.

I always overthink things and come to the worst conclusions first. Literally like 95% of my overthinking's have been wrong. I see something and immediately think these people are ghosting me or talking shit or lying to me or whatever and then later I find out the truth and it really was something completely innocent and unrelated to me.

Its always the same pattern but I cant ever trust or accept that everything's fine.

I ALWAYS seek out the worst in situations even though it pretty much never happens. Like I said, just about 95% of my insecure overthinking is wrong, but every time I get a inkling of doubt I come to the shittiest conclusion and stress myself out.",Stoicism,1701337607.0,t3_187ewam,0.89,30

I suck,"I'm a piece of fucking shit . I don't like myself right now as I'm typing this. I have a little brother who I'd kill for and die for, he's a little difficult to deal with but I love him none the less. I'm supposed to protect him from the dangers of this world but I can't even protect him from my fucking self. I don't mean to hurt him in any way possible but it seems like I keep unintentionally damaging him. I don't know what to do. Just an hour ago i was attempting to get him off my bed so that he can go to his as it's night time and I didn't want him to get scolded(he has a tendency to take forever to get on the bed) and I thought he got his footing when I lifted him up but he didn't. He fell backwards in a kneeling type position and then he fell back and hit his head hard. The sound was fucking horrifying. As he hit his head he cried Mama! Mama! Man that was fucking hard to listen to man 😢. Then he started crying and I held him up. He held his head as he was crying and I don't know what to fucking do man, i feel so fucking guilty. He's okay now and is on his bed but there's this huge bump that hurts on his head and I just can't keep myself together when i think about it. Not the first time he's hit his head because of me and i didn't mean to. I never mean to and yet he still gets fucking hurt. I've never had thoughts about ending my life and I never will but i just think i might. Thank God 🙏 he was seen to by my mom and is okay now but I don't know, i don't know what to do.


Hey guys I appreciate the comments. The reason why I needed to get it out was because it's not the first time I accidentally hurt him when I had no intention to. It sucks knowing that i could possibly hurt him when trying to help him and when i do remember i try to be mindful but I'm a fairly forgetful person so it doesn't always register.

Is the heroic masculine purpose equivalent to the pursuit of Stoic moral virtue?,"I just watched this video below and I cannot not see that there is a connection between the heroic masculine purpose themed in this deconstruction and the desire to live by Stoic virtues. Is there a connection? Are they the same thing? Is the heroic masculine purpose a real thing, and if so is there a place for it in Stoicism?

Part of the draw of Stoicism for me is, the desire to live a virtuous life. It oozes purpose. And to see that it permeates the idea of the masculine hero  in our popular culture shows that stoicism is mainstream yet undefined as such or masquerading as a hero's journey.

I never hold grudges. Am I a pushover or am I just being wise?,"Since I was very young, I’ve always resonated with the quote “Holding Onto Anger Is Like Drinking Poison and Expecting the Other Person to Die”

I sometimes temporarily get really sad or heartbroken or disappointed. But I rarely get too angry. Whenever someone does me wrong, I always try to see things from their perspective. 

I have zero malice or anger towards any ex lovers or ex friends. Often, I’ll even still have a little love for them. Some of them, if they have really betrayed my trust and try to get back into my life, I will say no because I don’t want to feel the pain of getting hurt again. That’s only if I feel like they are untrustworthy but not because I feel anger or resentment towards them. But it takes alot for me to even feel this. 

I worry that sometimes I am too forgiving and I wonder if I am just being too complacent and not able to think to see my worth by being too empathetic. 

So back to my question - am I just being a pushover or am I taking a mature stance on situations like this?

Also I am reminded by this quote by Epictetus, “Any person capable of angering you becomes your master; he can anger you only when you permit yourself to be disturbed by him.”

Edit: the only reason I’m even asking this or this thought comes to mind is because I have friends tell me I’m too forgiving & I shouldn’t be ",Stoicism,1701261505.0,t3_186ofzx,0.96,88

What should i keep in mind during these hard times?,"Im a 17 year old boy and im facing the lowest point of my life so far. 

I want to survive this painfully subjective pain but for context, it all started when my girlfriend of 18 months cheated off on me and treated me in a way such that even my counselor thinks that i’m emotionally abused. After all of those, my mind wouldn’t align with my emotions. I know i deserve better (probably attachment issues) but i still long for her.Fast forward, my parents went through divorce— my mom cheating on my stepfather. It felt painful as well as it somehow a cause of my relapse from the break up i had with my cheater gf. Though im getting through the intricate pain it confronts me with, I feel either nothing or disdain towards my mother. My brother and I are to meet the new guy my mom’s with.

The environment im in isn’t much that of a niceplace, relatives that surround are quite loud and impatient (it runs in our blood) everything’s stressing me out i tend to just sleep throughout which is counterproductive especially that i base off my self worth on my academic performance (this is probably due to how  some people especially my ex and her friends belittling me, breaking off because i wasn’t “out of their league” after all the efforts and care I gave her throughout.)

The little irritations,"Hi, people, in the last month I developed a passion for stoicism and I started reading and learning more about this philosophy. In addition, I do journalling from time to time, however, I have one issue in my character that is constantly making me unhappy.

I get angry or irritated by small stuff, which most of the time are IN my control. I have already been able to let go of trying to control events that I have no control over. ( “The more you seek to control external events, the less control you will have over your own life.” Epictetus)

I can describe myself as a more clumsy person. Sometimes when I drop on accident an item on the floor or get stuck in traffic, I get angry.. When I feel exhausted at the office, I get angry... I believe that life is too short to be angry at things that do not influence me in a direct way or my family. My father most of the time is nervous and I got that trait from him, I guess, when I was growing up. Do not get me wrong.. I have no hate against other individuals and I am a person who forgives very easily (This is something that really brings me joy by the way.)

Please give me your advice in regard to living a life, where there is no anger or annoyance at insignificant events or any other issue.

I believe myself to be a control freak and I immediate get into anxiety when things don't go my way.

Know that IT WILL BE DONE.

But when I get complicated work with deadlines, I DON'T KNOW IF IT WILL BE DONE and that stresses me out. I try to control so that i get easy work and I AM SAFE.

New to Stoicism: Found my role model public figure,"I (38 M) am relatively new to Stoicism. I have been aware of the general concept for a while, but I have recently started reading credible modern works and scratched the surface of the original classic philosophical writings.

I have been thinking about modern role models who exemplify Stoicism in their daily lives and conduct, in an attempt to study their behavior and learn from real-world examples in today's society. I immediately ignored all the online influencers who peddle a modern alpha-male view of Stoicism and say that we should all be stone-faced and emotionless and work our our thoughts in the gym. 

After thinking for a while, I have settled on Queen Elizabeth II as a role model. She seems to have implemented Stoicism quite successfully in her life, both in public and private. First of all, she is a model of duty and service. Unlike the modern stone-faced take of Stoicism, Queen Elizabeth exhibited many emotions in public, including joy, sadness, frustration, strength, and compassion. It is clear to me however, that her persona and public display of emotion were backed by deep thought and consideration of an appropriate reaction to events. There are times when she cried or wiped away tears in public, both in reaction to national and personal tragedies. There are times where she also exhibited immense joy in public, again both in reaction to personal and national events. 

As somebody whose personal life was on national display and under scrutiny, it makes sense that her actions were the result of reflection and consideration. With the stress of international politics, a dissolving empire and modernizing world, wars, family strife, and everything else that comes with being Head of State, I think that Queen Elizabeth would never have been so successful or popular had she not implemented principles of Stoicism, whether deliberately or not.

I am trying to draw lessons from her life as an example for me. While our situations are obviously very different, I think that I can still learn lessons. I have three kids, a wife, a stressful job with long hours, and finances are always on my mind. It has become harder and harder to manage my responsibilities, the needs of my family, and everything else that life throws at me.

Delving into classical Stoicism over the past few months has helped me realize that how I instinctually react to situations was not the example of rational consideration that I am trying to teach my children. I have already implemented lessons from my reading and observation, and I can tell that I am improving and growing. I'm excited to continue on my journey.

Epictetus on Adultery,"Hi guys, there’s this one Discourse of Epictetus where he talks about Adultery. I believe it’s 2.4 “Against a person who had once been detected in adultery”. I’m very surprised at how ruthless he is towards Adulterers. He sounds so 💅sassy💅.It’s just bar after bar after bar:

“Wherein shall I trust you? So if you were an utensil so worthless that a man could not use you, you would be pitched out on the dung heaps, and no man would pick you up. But if being a man you are unable to fill any place which befits a man, what shall we do with you? For suppose that you cannot hold the place of a friend, can you hold the place of a slave? And who will trust you? Are you not then content that you also should be pitched somewhere on a dung heap, as a useless utensil, and a bit of dung? Then will you say, “no man cares for me, a man of letters?” They do not, because you are bad and useless. It is just as if the wasps complained because no man cares for them, but all fly from them, and if a man can, he strikes them and knocks them down.

Can I be a good stoic?,"The title says it, I want to know if it is possible for me now to be a good stoic. The biggest problem I have personally comes from my past.

I have some people I talk to and I am social enough to have conversations and do my work right. But I am not someone that opens up or trusts people very quick, thus having no real friends. 

I understand where this problem comes from and I know humans need social contacts and I know that it is for the best to help others, because that is a person's goal in this life, but somehow I feel like I can't do it 100% right because people gave me this trauma in my past and it may always be a scar.

What to do with the regret and sadness of what happened in the past?,"I would like some advice, and I am hoping you Stoics have some food for thought on my problem:

  
I went to grad school in a different country 10 years ago, and during those two years, I had a personal fallout with a person that affected me so strongly, that I started to develop a depression that would take me about 5 year to finally start getting out of. During my studies, I did not develop deep friendships, as I began to withdraw from people due to my mental state. I moved away after graduating, and moved to another country and capital city. There I struggled with my depression for 4 years and then moved back to my own country. Here in my own country, I started to get better and have with the help of psychology left my mental problems behind.

My challenge is that I still feel a deep sadness for what I lost during those 5 years of depression - no university friendships, not even strong friendships in the capital city that I lived in for 4 years (as I was coping with my condition and couldn't get close to people) - and now, in my mid 30s, see that most people my age have their great university friends and friends from living abroad - and feel that I am constantly being confronted with my ""wound"". I guess I regret that what happened happened, and I wish things had been different.

What can I do? I even find myself meeting people who studied at my grad school (not at the same time, but it's a famous school) and I feel deeply sad and also a bit shameful when we have to ""share"" experiences and they tell me about all their great times and now life-long friends.

I thought about starting a new grad school experience, but since most people would be in their 20s, I have a gut feeling that it would not make good what happened back then... I guess that I am longing for going back to that time and relive it again, this time changning it, but because I am older now, that is not possible for me.

"question regarding Epictitus, religion and God","TL/DR: How do those of you who are atheist or agnostic deal with Epictitus teachings regarding God ?

so ive been practicing stoicism for a couple years. ive read Seneca, M.A, and the Enchiridion with some selected writings from the Discourses thrown in. Recently i picked up a full length version of Discourses. Epictitus talks a lot about God. we should follow God, man is the rational beast that got the gift to make use of impressions from God. etc.

While i have my own spiritual beliefs, i've never been okay with the idea of GOD. one God, one creator, calling God 'he'.

so my question is mostly aimed at atheists and agnostics; How do you get around Epictitus \~preaching\~ about God in this way. I like his teachings but i just dont vibe with the idea of God like he does.

i dont want to hear quotes, im interested in ya'lls personal opionions

lets have a good discussion

"Stoicism, Working Hard & Cancer","I am 35 years old and last year I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. It was big, but fortunately not that dangerous. I went through the thyroid removal procedure and then radioactive iodine therapy. I had a checkup in may and I have a more serious checkup in January. 

I afraid of this checkup. 

In general my illness affected my thinking about life. On one hand it taught me to enjoy everyday life and not to wait with my plans (for example travelling). On the other it affected my plans and ambitions in the negative way. 

What's the point of investing and saving money seriously if I my life can be ended soon? What's the point of learning new things if I could spend this time enjoying myself. What's the point of taking life seriously? 

In general for me it's constant thinking about my mortality (memento mori). It's like having grim reaper standing behind me all the time. unfortunately it's not a fully positive motivation for taking actions. It's rather demotivating me. 

Did any of you had similar experiences? I would love to talk with people that gone through something like this and learning how did it affected them.

Reflections on anger,"“I did not sleep well” is not a license to be rude to those nearby. 

In fact, anger is never the course of action one will find helpful. 

There will always be something which could upset you if you allow it. 

The important part is what you *do* with feelings, not suppressing them. 

Processing your pain is a skill you must nurture, and deserves your time. 

You have all the tools necessary to topple any anger, friend. 

Learn from discomfort, and discard what’s not useful. Don’t keep the anger.

How do I be a mentally tougher person?,"I find myself getting triggered often, most of the time by things that are just in my own mind (past events or dwelling too much about what someone said). I've been very isolated for the most formative years of my life (homeschooled and basically neglected at home through my entire teen years up until I became 18, went to college and got a job). Life was too much to take all at once I guess and I wasn't prepared. I guess the only real way to recalibrate is to sink or swim but after going through a traumatic experience I've isolated myself more or less completely once again, I guess because that's the only place I feel safe or familiar in. Even before then I had also had bouts of isolation.

I just don't want to be such a pussy anymore. I feel like I'm easily influenced by those around me especially my parents who have labeled me a lot of negative things. I feel like I'm still a child not an adult. I've worked and I've travelled, and I am pursing a degree, but I feel like something is missing and I don't like being so weak. I feel like it all comes down to my lack of interpersonal skills or experience with people that I needed and was deprived of and still deprived myself of. ",Stoicism,1701114570.0,t3_185btne,0.96,55

My family, relatives and coworkers are all Muslims and I tend to hide my true beliefs just to get along with them, and that doesn't bother me much. What truly bothers me is what I'm gonna write down.

Staying grounded around immoral people/rulebreakers,"Living in NYC, I often feel surrounded by immoral people and rule breakers which makes  it difficult to maintain inner peace for me. There are many instances throughout the day where someone breaks rules and it personally affects me; I’ve been struggling to find a way to stand up for myself, but also be able to let things go.

Some basic examples:
- I am waiting in line to board the bus and before I get on, someone tries to cut the line. I will make sure they are not able to cut in front of me, but it leads to verbal conflict and I tend to carry that with me (i.e. replaying it in my head all night)
- When crossing the street, a car runs a red light and almost hits me then shouts something at me. I also carry this with me—mostly the frustration that they don’t see what they did as wrong. If I impulsively react back to them, I often feel guilt for not ignoring them.
- While commuting, witnessing people driving illegally on the shoulder or wrecklessly cutting others off; it tends to make me upset, and wish there was more enforcement of the rules. 

What are some ways to work through this where I still feel able to assert myself, but can also let the event go without any further thought? I feel like if I do not stand up for my beliefs, I will become a pushover for the sake of taking the path of least resistance. My personal belief is also that if I were to not assert myself, that I am enabling/encouraging people to continue being immoral and breaking rules.",Stoicism,1701133375.0,t3_185je3o,0.88,13

I have failed in my life,"I'm 20(F) years old, and I don't feel like doing anything. I have felt like this my whole life. I guess I'm way too lazy.

Even the smallest task feels like a burden. I end up feeling nervous and stressed. I can't remember anything about anything; when I look back, all I see is darkness. I never achieved anything in my life,and to this day, I'm just a failure.

I have no job,no skills,the exam I was preparing for,I haven't studied for it from past 7 months,and I know I'm gonna fail , it's a national level exam and I wasted my time,I spent the whole year(2022) covering the syllabus and in the last crucial 7 months I fucked up,I didn't realise when the time passed by,I kept comparing my progress with others,I kept focusing on what others have and where I lack, the exam is in 1 month now,I don't remember anything I studied,sooo much of my syllabus is left , I'm gonna fail ,I can try next year,but it's not going to be easy because everyone is going to be making fun of me,my parents are going to be disappointed,I saw this coming, it's my fault and now I don't have the courage to face it ,to accept that I failed.

Now I'm left with nothing, and it's clear to me that after my graduation (after 5 months), I will have to sit at home. This eats me alive,it kills me,my parents are going to be so disappointed. Everyone is having the best time of their lives, and I'm a failure with no goal, confidence, skill, or talent in my life. Nothing excites me, nothing is interesting, and everything is turning gray. 

During my graduation period,I spent my time studying for uni exams, didn't make any friends, not even a bf, never got into illegal stuff,and I still failed,guess I was born to be a failure.

I have no friends , no one that I can share my feelings with, and I have always bottled up my feelings. To be honest,  I don't even know why I'm writing all of this here; nobody is even going to read it. I guess I'm just so desperate; every day is the same; every day I fail; every day I go to bed feeling like a burden; every day I feel others judging me and making fun of me; every day I fear my parents reaction; every day I'm a loser with nothing to offer and nothing to live for.

I don't feel like getting out of my bed,I just don't feel like doing anything.

How do I face this ugly version of me?,What should I do?,Do I even deserve to try again?,What if I keep failing?

How do I find my destiny?,"Hi guys, I’m 24 living in the UK and have been in a job for 6 years which isn’t that well paid but the company is really good and the people I work with are nice. I would say I’ve been in a comfort zone for ages now so from last year I have been looking for a new job, starting the gym going 6 times a week, feeling a lot better in myself and have been upskilling myself by doing courses outside of work ect. However recently I’ve had a knee operation and I feel like I’m back to square one. 

The main reason for this post is there’s so many different paths I could go down, how do I know I’m taking the right one to find my destiny/full potential?

1. Part of me thinks I could go to Uni (I didn’t go to begin with because I didn’t know what I wanted to do and I still don’t so I feel like it could be a waste of money)

2. Keep trying to find a new job- one that could solidify me into my 30s, so that I can afford to move out and eventually have a family.

3. Go travelling (people say you learn a lot and I agree but I don’t know how this will help me find a job in the long term)

All I want in life is to find peace, retire my parents, become the best version of myself but I genuinely don’t know what I want to do and feel a bit lost. It’s such a shame because I’m so flexible right now I would go anywhere in the world and start a job if it meant a great opportunity. 

Any advice would be great, it’s annoying because I know I’ll smash it once I get a good mentor or find the right company to move up in the world. I try to remain as stoic as possible as I think it’s a real test for yourself but recently I feel lost.",Stoicism,1701103255.0,t3_18577kz,0.79,10

"How to deal/handle those things that you can't control, but will happen sooner or later?","I want to learn more about the things i can't control and how to deal with them. I see lots of youtube videos about stoics. Nobody of them say/tell how to deal with those things that is out of control but eventually they will happen. 

For example, if someone close to you is diagnosed with a cancer or you are diagnosed with cancer, things won't be in your favor or anyone favor.  Once that happen, doing all of those treatments, anxiety, depression, anticipatory grief, things can turn to the worse in one way or another. Treatments will stop work or they will never work, your anticipatory grief will increase as the time goes by. Your anxiety and depression is skyrocketing within you.

But you can't control a lot of those things. So What then?

My dad this year was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer on February, had surgery (March) 3weeks later after diagnosis. If you know or don't know, having pancreatic cancer is a death sentence. The most aggressive cancer out there for someone to get. Mostly because is diagnosed late, have high tendency of recurrence. But in my dad case, his surgeon and onco told him his lucky to have surgery. I am in this anxiety, depression and anticipatory grief state about it. Will chemo worked? How long my dad will live?

"Stoicism seems to be, above all else, about reasoning.","Hello everyone, hope you're doing well today and, if you celebrate it, had a Happy Thanksgiving. I've been studying Stoicism more in depth for the first time lately, and I've read Meditations and currently am reading ""How To Think Like A Roman Emperor"" by Donald Robertson. Before this I've only known it through posts on this sub, quotes, and Youtube videos. The main thing I always heard about it is that it's about accepting what you can't control, and while that seems to be a big part of it, I think the main part of it is just relying on your own mental faculties and abilities to reason.

For instance, in Meditations(Gregory Hays version), Marcus constantly mentions the ""Logos"", which in the ancient Stoic view is the rational force that governs the Universe, and on a personal level, is the use of logic and reason itself. The first part of 3.5 states one should ""never act under compulsion, out of selfishness, without forethought, or with misgivings"". It's even more apparent in 3.11, where he mentions that ""Nothing is so conducive to spiritual growth as this capacity for logical and accurate analysis of everything that happens to us"".

In Donald Robertson's book, I learned about the ""Stoic model of emotion"" as described by Seneca in ""On Anger"", which says we go through three stages. The first is the initial impression of an event, like, ""The boat is sinking"", which naturally invokes anxiety. The second is when we start ""catastrophizing"", or creating value judgements in our head like ""I'm going to die a horrible death"", which is a completely separate activity from the first event and is entirely made from our own imagination. In this stage, after we recognize our natural feelings, we should look for ways to improve our situation, or at least recognize that panicking won't help. If you can't do this, then you will enter stage 3, and start panicking and acting without reason, which is fully based on your assumptions of the initial event.

So in conclusion, accepting events as they are is important, but the main idea seems to be able to analyze those events and be able to view them in an objective manner so that you can handle them in a calm and rational manner.

How to deal with the parts of our mind we can't really control?,"A short preface:

My former co-workers pulled a very, very rude move towards me. It was an unprovoked, unprofessional, entirely unnecessary and petty situation. But, I don't blame them and I don't think they are bad people. I recognize that they are simply very misguided. I knew that even before. They act contrary to the human nature, and, in the long run, by their antisocial actions, they hurt only themselves. 

I consulted the situation with my current boss. She is a really wise person and I am grateful for having her around. She advised me how to deal with the situation in a very professional, elegant, and, actually, a very stoic way, and I did so. Therefore, I think I dealt with the problem in the best way I could.

I recognize all these things as externals, and that I have zero control over them. This kind of situation happens, there are people who act like this, and that’s fine. They can try however hard they want, but they can’t hurt my faculty of choice. 

BUT, here is the problem. 

You probably heard about the concept of the monkey mind. It refers to all the spontaneous and random thoughts that appear constantly in our minds. There is a variety of meditative practices helping to calm down the busy monkey mind. 

The thing is, this little ugly animal that dwells in my skull literally went nuts during the three days spanning the situation I described. I constantly analysed and re-analysed what happened, and it was difficult for me to focus on any other things. As I wrote above, at the level of rational thought, either from the perspective of philosophy or from the perspective of everyday dealings, I knew perfectly that everything was ok, that it wasn't a big deal at all. Their petty scheme was revealed and I have the full support of my current boss. It couldn’t have gone better. But, the less rational, or maybe, the emotional part of my mind couldn’t settle. 

Here are my questions to you guys.

Seneca wrote that the greatest remedy for anger is delay. What I felt wasn’t really anger, I felt simply bad. Just bad and tired. Do you think that time is the best remedy for all the feelings and thoughts we can’t control? Maybe you know some other ways to deal with this? I can’t simply say to myself ‘stop thinking about it’ and, well, stop thinking. It doesn’t work this way. Is distracting myself with other activities and just waiting the only option?

The thing that has been bothering me from the very beginning of learning about Stoicism is this: the Stoics wrote a lot that (if I understand it correctly, of course) the only thing we control in its entirety is our faculty of choice. But, as we all experience, our thoughts aren’t completely under our control. So, should we treat our thoughts as, basically, externals? Or maybe there are two categories of thoughts, our rational thoughts and the monkey mind’s, external thoughts? If so, where is the boundary?

What are your thoughts about these problems, guys?

I did confirm with my derms about using the product,but I should have know that they are not paying attention really to it. It's confidence killing and psychologically crippling for me.

How can I break free from the suffering of my mistakes and accept the current me. I have practice to be in the present, but every time looking at the mirror, I feel like I'm always stucked in the past.",Stoicism,1700887521.0,t3_183brv3,0.9,22

"Reflections on Meditations, 11.8","Hello!

I'm relatively new to Stoicism and wanted to share my reflections on a quote from Meditations 11.8:

""A branch cut off from the adjacent branch must of necessity be cut off from the whole tree also. So too a man when he is separated from another man has fallen off from the whole social community. Now as to a branch, another cuts it off, but a man by his own act separates himself from his neighbor when he hates him and turns away from him, and he does not know that he has at the same time cut himself off from the whole social system. Yet he has this privilege certainly from Zeus who framed society, for it is in our power to grow again to that which is near to us, and again to become a part which helps to make up the whole. However, if it often happens, this kind of separation, it makes it difficult for that which detaches itself to be brought to unity and to be restored to its former condition. Finally, the branch, which from the first grew together with the tree, and has continued to have one life with it, is not like that which after being cut off is then ingrafted, but it is something like what the gardeners mean when they say that it grows with the rest of the tree, but that it has not the same mind with it.""

When I first read Meditations, this quote reminded me of situations I've encountered throughout my life. The first time it happened was when my aunt divorced her husband. They stopped all communication, which is a horrible thing to do. This caused a chain effect where she also stopped communicating with the rest of his family and all of his friends. It was a major blow for our side of the family since we really liked those people and enjoyed hanging out together. As it became awkward to ignore the elephant in the room, our communication died out over time, and a decade later, we became strangers.

I often think about this quote, especially nowadays when ghosting has become a regular thing and what effect is has on society as a whole.",Stoicism,1700834740.0,t3_182sudb,0.94,15
Stoicism and ambition,"Can somebody practice stoicism and be ambitious at the same time? Stoicism encourages us to focus on character and becoming virtuous and considers external things, such as financial success and status, as unnecessary. By trying to have a successful career are you not placing value on external things like money and prestige ? Would a true stoic not chase these things, but not reject them either if they happened get them by chance?",Stoicism,1700830958.0,t3_182rmq5,0.94,14
Friendships,"Friendships are a gift and shouldn’t be taken for granted. As someone who grew up having separation anxiety, I clung to anyone who gave me any validation or comfort. I put my friends on a pedestal and was hurt a lot when they didn’t cherish me the way I did them, and that’s just because they were never really a true friend in the first place. An orphan growing up in the party scene of the early 2000s will do that to a young soul. I had one genuine friend who passed away suddenly very young, I believe we were just 20. I can’t remember exactly because it traumatized me so much I don’t remember much from that year and surrounding years are a blur. Since then I had trouble finding another friend like her who loved me as unconditionally as I did her. Since then I learned how to be alone and be a better friend, leaving behind my party friends and I found my loving husband in my mid 20s through one friend from my party life who managed to get out as I did, starting a band together and a new healthier lifestyle. I found stoicism through my now husband of 7 years.

I did eventually make a friend at 23 who I would have considered my best friend until just a few days ago who we shared much of the same values and loves as, but we grew apart over the last 10 years and now I just don’t know who they are anymore and it hurts me to be treated like a blip in someone’s mind when we used to be inseparable and almost psychically connected like siblings.

Our communication became more stagnant over 5 years,  by their needs, not mine. And when I reach out to check in on them it feels hollow and lonely because often their response is that they’re going through a lot and can’t hold space for me, even though it was just me who is doing the checking in on them. I know it’s a response that comes from “please don’t ask  because I can’t return the gesture right now” And that’s 90% of the few times I reach out. Still, as a friend, I don’t feel it right to stop checking on their wellbeing knowing they’re struggling so much, so I space it out a month-3 months at a time which apparently was still too much. The last check in was for their birthday, and was not met with any kindness unfortunately, just a flat “thank you” and another “I’m too burnt out to see how you’re doing, maybe another time.” Which I respond with another “that’s ok” but then retract because I need to be honest with myself this time, it’s not okay. They’re not okay.  I’m not allowed in, door shut in my face another time. They try to be there for moments of joy,  but they’re miles away and I can’t reach them no matter how much attention or space I offer. I understand their mental illness struggles deeply. I hold them above my own at times so that I can hold space for them but my well of nurturing has run dry because they didn’t help with refilling and I understand they know they can’t and that’s why I shouldn’t have kept trying.

I had reached a high point in my life the past year and I want to share my new found joys with them and share joyful life experiences without our previous trauma bond. (I’ve made new friends to share my joys with and have stopped forming relationships based on our past traumas, even though inevitably those traumas will be shared with each other because that’s how I know we’ve worked passed them and continue to hold our identities separate from those life changing experiences.) I want to believe we had a stronger bond than just that. They have been in a really bad place for a very long time and still getting worse, they don’t eat don’t sleep and had to have surgery unrelated but still alongside other health conditions. I pestered them a bit more than usual because I’m seriously concerned that they’re killing themself rapidly and not telling me what’s going on. I still haven’t been informed how their surgery went or recovery is going. 

It hurts but also I feel relieved. It’s a hard pill to swolllow and I’ll always love them and hope they can be healthy and happy again without me since I was clearly not the one that could be there for them no matter how much space and energy I reserved for them.

I told them I’ll always be there if they need but I can’t keep letting myself get hurt, confused and inevitably unfulfilled. It would be fulfilling if I was any help to bring them to a place of comfort but I’m afraid I don’t do that for them anymore. They don’t treat our friendship as a therapeutic relief like we used to. We used to talk through our issues, thought processes, creative processes together often on hikes through the hills and sometimes just making art together. Alone but together, I call it. I’ll always cherish those days. Where they are now is not where I am welcome anymore and that’s okay. I’ll never stop letting people into my life just because of this experience, always fate permitting. 

They want to talk about it another time and says I’m still family to them, which I concur.  

Either way, I’m at peace with it now to just let go in stillness, but is there anything more I should’ve done or should do at this point while still protecting my heart?",Stoicism,1700843322.0,t3_182vxa5,0.67,5

I keep beating myself up,"Well I’ve never been one to post my problems online but here we go. There’s this girl I work with and things were good in the beginning.

Couple of months go by and I can tell she’s losing interest so I backed off, but then she’d come back around and start flirting again and my feelings would come back. It was this constant hot and cold relationship, and I know this is a game but I still played.

Secret phrases or references,"Many groups have secret signs, handshakes, insignia or phrases used to warn, acknowledge or indicate to other members of the group that they are also in said group when in public. I’m thinking mainly of fraternities and secret societies. Sometimes these phrases could mean as simple as “good job” but without saying the specific words.  

Did the ancient stoics have any secret phrases whereby they could indicate to others they are practicing stoics or did they have a “nickname” for fellow stoic students?

"Does the lack of ""good"" and ""evil"" and the existence of Justice as a cardinal virtue oposse each other?","I can understand all other cardinal virtues. Temperance and Courage are quite self-explanatory and easy to understand.

Wisdom is harder, but this quote summarizes it pretty well I think:

>*“The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control. Where then do I look for good and evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but within myself to the choices that are my own”* — Epictetus

So wisdom is basically the understanding of dichotomy of control, virtues - vices and indifferents.

But Justice just looks like Catch 22.

You need to be ""good"" (perfect, virtuous) to be able to make rational and perfect decisions. But to do that, you need to have perfect virtues. But how are you going to act just when you don't have the ability what is just because you are not perfectly virtuous and cant make the perfect judgment?

**So - what is Justice?**

Can someone please just hint at what should ""**Justice**"" be? I read a lot about it, but the best explanation I could come up with was ""do things for the common good"" or - ""do good things"". It is supposed to be the most important virtue, but the concept eludes me.

One person says justice is about symphaty and love, other one is giving example of going to literal war. The best these explanations can do is give bunch of examples that show Courage, but not Justice. The only things those examples have in common is usually people a) doing what they thing is right and b) they are judged as moral by today's moral lenses.

So is ""being just"" simply acting in such a way that you think is right? That is, regardless of what would ""objectively"" be just if you were omniscient?

Example: **I travel though time to try toilets in 1939 (I am a historic toilet experience enjoyer). I meet a random person at the toilet and we make smalltalk, he gets a heart-attack and i save him.

A General Stoic Attitude (in summary),"**Source:** *From Theory to Practice: Exploring Stoic Pragmatism for a Life of Resilience and Significance*, MASTER’S THESIS IN PHILOSOPHY, by Max Giezen (Erasmus University Rotterdam, 2023), pages: 19-20.

The combined works of Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus give rise to a general Stoic attitude that offers valuable insights for living a fulfilled life. At its core, this worldview focuses on rational decision-making and the cultivation of personal virtues. By cultivating a steady mind and regulating our thoughts, we discover a harmonious balance within nature. It becomes essential to gracefully accept external circumstances as they unfold, while using our rational agency to effectively manage those aspects within our control.

There is a divine essence inherent in our being that serves as a guiding force for our ethical behavior when we align ourselves with it. Recognizing the interconnectedness of all living beings, we accept the responsibility to extend benevolence, affection, and cooperation to others. Serenity and inner peace become attainable through the practice of self-discipline as we strive to embody virtues such as wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice. These virtues not only contribute to personal excellence, but also play a vital role in the betterment of society as a whole.

Stoicism focuses our attention on the interconnected fabric of existence, urging us to acknowledge our place within the natural order and to detach ourselves from external outcomes. By fostering empathy, kindness, and forgiveness, we create an environment conducive to personal growth and transformation. By adopting the Stoic attitude, we embark on a journey of self-improvement and the pursuit of the common good. By adhering to these timeless principles, individuals not only gain wisdom, but also align their lives with the inherent harmony of the universe.

Cancer and Breakup,"Is there any stoic or non-stoic advice for me? 

about 5 months ago my ex broke up with me. I started studying stoicism and other schools of philosophy to improve myself and that helped. I am doing so much better than I was doing when the break up happened. But a couple of days ago she reached out to ask me to come pick up an old hoodie of mine. I told her she could throw it away but she refused so I agreed to come. During the time she chose to meet I had a job meeting which I couldn't skip so she said ""I'll come after my treatment"". Then I asked about the treatment and she told me she has stage 2 cancer.

Since then I have been feeling tired and sad all the time. I feel helpless and scared and I want to be there for her but I don't know how or if she even wants me to be there for her. I told her that even though we broke up that doesn't mean we can't be friends and told her that I am here for her and she said ""idm being friends"". This removed my doubts that she contacted me as a ""call for help"".  She doesn't care but I still do and I am scared that I would lose her without being able to spend more time with her. This situation brought back a lot of feelings that I thought were long gone. I feel like I still love her and care for her although she really messed me up in the past. I know I shouldn't focus on things I can't control but I feel like shit because of this and don't know how to stop thinking about it.

Accepting Who You Are,"I have figured out that certain things have become ingrained in my personality which I will not be able to change. To start with, I am an introvert, who has serious self-esteem issues. In every conversation ever, I am the person who nobody listens, ignores or taken care of. In my friend group, I am just a listener. And it has happened with me since childhood, to school, and now to college. Because of this isolation, I have very 'weird' interests as per freinds like philosophy, physics, biology, aviation, military, history, and in music I like metal song which everyone mocks me for. I am told multiple times that I live under rock, boring, or idiot. Also the fact I dont like to hurl abuses, and cannot take stand for myself, I am mocked heavily for it.

 I am ugly also and even has wrinkles hands at age of 18, as per conventional beauty standards of this shitty fuckin society. Every girl whom I talked to, or tried to talk always gave dry responses, ignores me or just... you can easily think. Nobody even boys have ever complimented me on my looks, or just whatever, even when I wear the best clothes. All of my friends have received such compliments from each other

Academically also, I am sufferring because I cant ace in exams, because I always study for knowledge and curiosity and not like to cram things.

I really want to accept myself and my body, accept the way I look, sound, talk and overall who I am. I have teared myself down so many times that I lost the count.

What drugs was Marcus Aurelius taking?,"Galen, his physician, says that Marcus Aurelius took a traditional remedy called *theriac*, which contained ""a grain"" of opium. We don't know what precise quantity this denotes, unfortunately, but Galen seems to be implying that it was a small amount.  Marcus complained that it was making him drowsy, so Galen reduced the dose further.  Some people have speculated that he was an addict.  I don't think the evidence supports that conclusion as use in very small doses, from what I gather, wouldn't necessarily lead to addiction, and the fact that Marcus requested a *reduction* in the does perhaps also speaks against it.

What's less well-known, perhaps, is that we're told several times in the Roman histories that when Marcus finally visited Athens he was initiated into the mysteries at nearby Eleusis, in a ceremony which entailed drinking a potion known as the *kykeon.*  In his bestseller, *The Immortality Key: The Secret History of the Religion with No Name*, Brian C. Muraresku collects evidence that suggests the *kykeon* contained ergot, cultivated for its hallucinogenic properties.  Marcus' trip to Eleusis seems to have been an important public event but it happened in 176 CE, which was probably after he'd finished writing the *Meditations*.

Enchiridion 21,"“21. Let death and exile, and all other things which appear terrible be daily before your eyes, but chiefly death, and you will never entertain any abject thought, nor too eagerly covet anything.” 
Enchiridion 21,  Epictetus. 

My own interpretation is the following:  
""It's hard to be a good person when no one is watching. But know that posterity always watches. When you understand that your body and belongings will be returned at some point, and together with your actions(the result of your thoughts) will be judged by posterity. Then you will always be motivated to do the right thing.""

I am trying to understand the psychological mechanisms behind why visualising death will motivate me to not to think “abject thoughts” and “too eagerly covet anything”

I am not happy with my own interpretation and unpacking of Enchiridion 21 and would love to get your feedback and guidance?",Stoicism,1705827749.0,t3_19bzbjr,0.72,3

I might have done the same thing to someone too and have often been on the receiving end as well.

Dealing with my Breakup,"I have mostly been a person detached emotionally to concepts of relationship or having a girlfriend because of my first breakup . Anyway I had a friend for an year or so and eventually we both developed liking towards each other . And as days passed I realized I was deeply in love with her . Because of that I often ignored how she used to slide her toxicity ( she literally tried to convince me to against my family) , spoke shit about my father , and even when I tried to communicate my problems , she used to put the blame on me and use tears as her weapon against me . There was a guy in our lives who basically was fellow classmate . he tried to talk to her and they started sharing reels and stuff , I was unbothered by it . But as she was my girlfriend he labelled her a slut infont of our peers for talking to her . for which I literally had a fight with him threaten him and they stopped talking. Before our breakup my girlfriend told me that because I wasn't talking to her for awhile she started talking with him again.

I've been (is) worried about the state of the world - was told about Stoicism,"Hello. I have been doomscrolling throughout the internet. I've been keep reading bad news all over the world ever since europe warns citizens from Russia.

&#x200B;

I have a problem with not knowing everything and I cannot accept it (right now).

I'm a father, kid is 1 years old, I love him to death. I wish nothing bad to ever happen to him (like every parent I hope). After all this war related stuff, i've been very depressed and I fear for the future.

I've been reading about Russia/Ukraine, NATO/Russia, North Korea threats, Iran building nukes, Israel/Gaza war, China/Taiwan. To a point where I just couldn't handle all the information and just broke.

&#x200B;

So i've come here, hoping to learn from you guys. I don't know much about stoicism but I read this simple definition of the term ""In simple terms, Stoicism **teaches us to focus on the things we can control—our thoughts, emotions, and actions—while accepting the things we cannot**, such as the actions of others or the natural course of events going on in the world around us.""

This is probably just what I need to learn in my life, but I don't know how to accept that this is what I need to do.

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading.

EDIT: I've told myself to STOP doomscrolling, stop watching all the news. Accepting that the world has always been screwed up, it's hard to take in everything. While I wish to stay informed, I don't believe I need to listen to every quote or read about everything. This is my first step.


EDIT2: Bookmarks, Reddit communities, TikTok algorithms has been removed (on these topics).

She is currently thinking about the state of our relationship and where it is heading. Im afraid that we might be breaking up.

It inspired me to create this:

""An animal decays upon death, rocks seemingly eternal withers against time. Even trees who stand straight bows down eventually. What about the mind and soul? Pests and roots cannot reach it, as it is independent of the physical world. Time does not weaken or strengthen it, only philosophy and commitment to the divine self can.

Turning to you guys for help. Lost faith in life.,"Stoicism has helped me through many of my tough times but I’m out of it now, I’ve slipped into depression. 

This is why: I’m from a fairly lowly background and I dedicated my life to a career.  The idea was I would prove my worth by becoming successful through grit.  

Over the last few years:

One of my friends from a well-connected family got an offer from a friend - a connection.  He spent a lot of his life living like a playboy and now he’s leapfrogged me in career due to the network he has that I don’t. 

My other friend who didn’t graft like me is set in inherit money I would never dream of. 

My brother, who has spent a lot of his life avoiding hard work, has pushed a pretty weak medical negligence claim but will win more money than I’ll ever have and retire from it.  

My parents inherited all the family money and left nothing for us, spent it all on drugs and alcohol and on my brother.  

Now I am trapped working long hours in a hard career and I have less than all these people.  As I have to work hard my daughter is having issues in school.

The link between what I do and what I get is broken.  I’ve ended up with less than everyone but I did everything right.

I’m losing faith in life, everything.  I want to give up, it keeps happening. Everyone I know is ending up wealthy through fate and I’m stuck still with a mortgage, long hours etc. 

What was it all for?  I can’t stop as we will be impoverished.   Why did fate choose me to be the worker?  The other hilarious point is my earnings are taxed heavily but all their inheritance and claim is tax free, so I’m having to pay their taxes too. 

I know these are externals etc but I got to wake up at 5 every day and have health problems.  I got to have less time with kids. It’s not money, it’s my quality of life. 

I don’t have to be super rich and I don’t mind others good fortune but I feel like I’ve been conned.  It’s all mainly luck and God and fate seems to want to rub my nose in it.  It’s a good job I have kids otherwise after this happening so often I would want to check out of this corrupt and unfair world",Stoicism,1705813830.0,t3_19bvqaf,0.62,2
I know what i need to do i just dont know what to do about it. I base my self worth on external factors and its making me miserable.. like not having friends makes me feel worthless.

For example no one is talking with me rn and its making feel worthless. 

Makes me feel like i have nothing interesting or worthwhile or useful to say. 

Most times i try to say something like this i get left on seen or in real life people say reply with one words. 

What do i need to do? Read? Meditate? Find a hobby? Follow my interests? Learn more about conversations and talking? Set boundaries? Do things that make me happy? Set a specific goal and achieve it? I have many problems but im trying not to overwhelm my self and just focus on one thing at a time. 

And it all goes back to low self esteem.. like i don't think girls will be interested in me, like i feel like im good enough.",Stoicism,1705788345.0,t3_19bn9go,0.81,3
Years later,"Hi All, 28F looking for some advice here..

I grew up in a small town with a tight group of friends from elementary school through high school. Growing up, we were attached and all thought we’d be friends for the rest of our lives, in each others weddings etc. When we went off to college, we each went our separate ways, got jobs in different cities but stayed in contact thru social media, keeping each other up to date in a group message. At the time, I had gotten into a new relationship which eventually became toxic. I had made some new friends where I was studying/working and they knew about what was going on and what I was dealing with but I was so reluctant to tell my hometown friends about what I was going through.. I remember feeling embarrassed by the situation I was in. They all seemed happy and successful and I didn’t know how to communicate it. 3-4 months go by, (maybe more, I can’t remember exactly) where I don’t respond or update my life in this group message. One day I sign on and see that one of the girls removed me from the group. I remember a ton of emotions and at that time (6-7 years ago) I was still young and spite got over me, so I deleted all of my socia accounts which of course was wrong in hindsight. The first few months I felt pissed/angry and then as time went on, I felt an immense amount of guilt for never addressing it properly.  I’m at a point in my life where I know that we all moved on and that’s life, to accept it and I don’t feel as guilty as I did, considering no one reached out to me during one of the hardest times of my life to see how I was doing. But Im now having my own milestones my life and I miss them and so I’m having a hard time accepting it at the moment and I’m starting to feel guilty again",Stoicism,1705785978.0,t3_19bmd61,0.6,2

My feeling when I am unhappy in general,"Hello, dear friends! ❤️

I have very difficult situation..
I am unhappy now .. in everything..
I am confused und very tired emotionally in soul. 

A lot of different situations create responsibilities for me which I must to do. It is not fantasy, it is from reality. 
As example, to study German language every day from 7:30 - 16:30 on classic school in 14 faculties and after study it in integration course 17:00-19:15 Monday - Thursday.
After I have to do a lot of tests and exams in Bio/Chemie/History/German Literature/Ethik/Art/Informatik/Math/another subjects in school for grades minimum 4 - maximum 1-2. And I have to do general exam in B1 German from integration course in March.
And in Juni I have to do Exam from German History for integration.

In another side, I have to do a volunteer project in school because it is special  important program for to get grades for all students in 9 classes from 3 faculties - GRW, Deutsch, Ethik. It is a main responsibility inside school for everyone in 9 class.

And also I have to do a lot of homeworks in 14 faculties of school and in integration course. 

I have to go to doctors also at this time when I must to be in the lessons.

I have to send all documents for Jobcenter because of Bafög (Bafög is smaller for me then Burgergeld which I got earlier. I can not to pay for my flat by this money, and for food it is also not anough per month). I have to write in Email a lot about it for Jobcenter. I am tired also of it.

I have to have good grades in study. When grades will badly in study faculties or in exam of integration German, - in faculties I have to repeat 9 class once more, and in integration corse I have to pay new course to repeat last level of German language because it is new law which government of Germant created for Ukrainians in January 2024. It is a biggest stress.

In result...

I love in my heart English, study in English, work in profession in English (as a UI/UX Designer - 5 years, Front-End developer - 7 years). 
I love to paint illustrations in study materials also.
I love a lot to be as a mentor in developing software (have 2 years experience in this area).
But...
I can not to do it in Germany.. because they from government wanted from me to study German language and go to work which they want (not a developer, not a designer/illustrator). For designer/illustrator/developer in requirements for work in companies they need a lot of ""Ausbildung in Graphik/Kunst/Digital"" , ""B2 Deutsch"", ""Akademische Ausbildung"".
When I see it, I feel myself unhappy. 

I am cry today a lot when I opened German language book of integration because I have to do a lot of Homeworks of study it, and I really hate it now(o Got, I said it.. hope, the Germans will not hate me of this). 

Why I have to do things and processes in Germany which I don't like/hate/because another institutions want it?

I feel happy when I paint illustrations of study books/materials, when I teach development for somebody and believe in this person, when I see how my student goes to get win in study process and how he gets it with happy in his face, when I can develop software by myself, when I can do researchment and read / collect special data of research for create some functions in software.. 

But.. I can not to do it in Germany.. 
I have education in internet from Ukraine, not from Ausbildung in Deutschland.. it is not enough here for work and study, and study German language for my mind is more difficult as English.

I really love English with all my heart.. I also would like to teach English for German people as a teacher.. but this needs Uni/Studium of Teaching and special license of teaching (only according German standards of teaching)

When I understand this, I am cry once more..
I am confused.. 

What do you think, what will do in my place Aristoteles or Mark Aurelius?/or Kannt/ or Nicshe?

I am very grateful for your help..

Because today I am in a border of depression..

I want advice that I can use in the moment. Not just platitudes to repeat.,"I get nervous around people. Socially anxious. I know that I don't want to give my thoughts and time over to what I think others think of me (ofcourse, unless it is something that is right) because I know that it is not a good use of time.

Advice like ""life is too short for this"" and ""They don't think about you"", or ""You can't control their thoughts"", or ""It's all in your head"", are kind of useless when my reaction is automatic and my thoughts are buried in my subconsciousness.

I need some advice that I can try daily to combat my subconscious thoughts, and also in the moment. I need something that can change that automatic reaction.

Though I am aware of these thoughts in the moment, and even talk to myself in my head to reason with myself right at that moment I realise I am having these thoughts, I can't control the ""stiffness"" I feel when I feel as if they're staring at me, or judging me.

My biggest life mistake was wanting to live an easy life,"2023 summons this the best, I didn’t want to exercise, diet, barely studied, barely did anything useful, expected my friend to do all the work for me, procrastinated a lot by saying that “tomorrow I start to do this”, got addicted to porn, tried to be a people pleaser (even going against some of my own believes), etc 

I regressed a lot as a person and what  were my rewards for wanting to live an easy life basically in autopilot with no logic and following just pure emotions ? Anxiety, memory issues, suicidal thoughts, weight gain, burnout, a lot of extra final exams that almost cost me a full semester, almost lost some of my friendships, i got way behind my peers and didn’t get my driver’s license 

Growing up I was never pushed/expected to do great things, if I was average that was enough for my parents and me, my mom basically did my homework for me, I would eat and watch tv all day and not leave the apartment and no one would care, so I never developed discipline, sense of urgency and maturity 

I have my ups and downs but basically to this day I lack those core elements and the 4 stoic principles 

With no temperance no self discipline nor control so I will waste my days with pleasurable things and just “do the important things tomorrow”, even tho nothing guarantees me a tomorrow

With no wisdom no intelligence and resourcefulness making me have bad grades at my college and be afraid to treat patients (I’m learning to be a dentist but I don’t reread core concepts such as anesthesia so I just ask my friend to do all the work for me at the clinic)

With no courage no scape from my comfort zone so I don’t try to improve myself 

With no justice I abandon my principles of wanting to be a good man and focus only on pleasing people and not strengthening or even developing a sense of character 

I hope that this serves me as an experience of what living a shallow existence is and how to always try to be better than yourself from yesterday (even if it takes baby steps)",Stoicism,1705691126.0,t3_19aqv6w,0.97,169
