I love this story so much - I'm trying to learn not to mind what others think of me - I welcome any help!,"At one time the Buddha was staying near RƒÅjagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels‚Äô feeding ground.

The brahmin BhƒÅradvƒÅja the Rude heard a rumor that a  brahmin of the BhƒÅradvƒÅja clan had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in the presence of the ascetic Gotama. Angry and displeased  he went to the Buddha and abused and insulted him with rude, harsh  words. When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him:

‚ÄúWhat do you think, brahmin? Do friends and colleagues, relatives and family members, and guests still come to visit you?‚Äù

‚ÄúSometimes they do, Master Gotama.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you then serve them with fresh and cooked foods and savories?‚Äù

‚ÄúSometimes I do.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut if they don‚Äôt accept it, brahmin, who does it belong to?‚Äù

‚ÄúIn that case it still belongs to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn the same way, brahmin, when you abuse, harass, and attack us who do not abuse, harass, and attack, we don‚Äôt accept it. It still belongs to you, brahmin, it still belongs to you!

Someone  who, when abused, harassed, and attacked, abuses, harasses, and attacks  in return is said to eat the food and have a reaction to it. But we neither eat your food nor do we have a reaction to it. It still belongs to you, brahmin, it still belongs to you!‚Äù# # #

I realized it is a slight variation to the gift story where it is food instead which I actually like a lot better because he talks about ""if you don't eat the food, do you react to it?""

I love that consuming aspect of it - because we are consuming or taking in others thoughts and options of it.  But if we don't consume it / eat it / take it in then how would we get a reaction?

Feeling doomed after the realization of our endless cycle.,"After many years spent thinking about Buddha's teachings, suddenly, the realizations start to actually ""sink"" into my own perception: I am going in circles with endless rebirths. 

I feel overwhelmingly intimidated by this recently and so suddenly - even though I know the concept of rebirth and karma long ago since I was a child. Even as time (which is a product of our own construction) goes on, I feel as if it is merely an illusion.  I am ... stuck. 

It feels like the road we are traveling on (with occasional stops to refuel - rebirth) is endless and  that going further is pointless as it never stops. It is like the mirror which is shattered... but we still need it to see ourselves.

I know it sounds crazy but, how can I deal with this, fellow Buddhists? Thank you very much.

Edit: is this nihilism thinking? Am I ""feeling doomed"" because I am conditioned to interpret in this way?",Buddhism,1705815089.0,t3_19bw34e,0.81,9
request for advice regarding my practice,"Hello, my friends

I've Already decided on tibetan buddhism but it's tough for me to actually walk the path because of certain constraints I have. 

Due to the fact that I'm still a teenager, I don't really have the freedom to go to the tibetan-buddhist temples or centres in singapore. I also can't really spend any money on any malas, statues or online courses. Only thing I can really spend money on is books. I also don't really have the luxury of being able to study under a teacher right now.

Right now, how do I walk the path of tibetan-buddhism within these constraints? How do I learn meditation practices like tonglen, vipassana, shamantha and metta in a way that is true to my specific sect which is tibetan buddhism without spending any money on courses, online or in person? 

I do have full internet access but do bear in mind that even my access to tibetan buddhist books might be indirectly restricted due to my parents, who might not want me spending too much time on something like religion and/or who might be afraid that this distracts me from my studies.

Again, I need a structured practice but it's hard to do so with so little resources. Would appreciate any advice :)

Presenting the Dharma on Social Media,"Please read this post entirely before responding in order to avoid any misunderstanding. I will try to make my intentions as clear as possible.

I am considering the possibility of setting up a social media channel in order to present the Dharma to anyone who stumbles upon it and is interested.

By 'presenting the Dharma' I specifically mean:
* Quoting Pali Canon Suttas and Mahayana Sutras.
* Mentioning useful books and online resources.
* Sharing personal experience (explicitly marked as being personal).

EDIT: I forgot to mention that I intentionally chose the word 'presenting' as in 'showing', 'sharing', 'replicating'. I am *not* speaking of *teaching* the Dharma.

I *do not* intend to do any of the following:
* Misrepresent myself as a qualified teacher.
* Misrepresent my personal views as Dharma.
* Attack other traditions or religions.
* Making money in any shape or form.
* Using unskillful methods to boost engagement (e.g. baiting people with false promises or intentionally evoking intense emotions).
* Criticizing people or trying to pressure, change or convert them.
* Engage in fruitless online discussions.
* Pursuing fame or recognition.
* Starting a new school, let alone a cult.

I am also well aware of what awaits me if I slander the Dharma or cause division in a Sangha.

In short, I intend to present the Dharma in accordance with the Dharma.

Please also note that I am not expecting anything from this. I am not emotionally attached to this project. I just want to use my abilities and means to do what's skillful.

Thanks for reading all of this. Here are my questions:
* **Is this a skillful thing to do at all?** If not, please just say so.
* **If so, did I miss anything that I should be aware of?**",Buddhism,1705842173.0,t3_19c2ypf,0.75,2

About the gods.,"One of the things I see so often here, is a casual disregard, a misunderstanding and fundamental lack of empathy regarding deities. 

Because of this, I want to set the record straight on their behalf. It means more to me than is so often quoted. If any of you are actually a real Buddhist, then you will understand. 

Gods are people. They are, fundamentally no different than us. In realms without the teaching, many of them live lives of service to others. The weight of hundreds, of thousands of years is behind that statement. 

Many gods see the Dharma, and they eventually become Dharma protectors. Many, Many gods choose this path. I've seen enough to know that, statistically speaking, any random god more likely to achieve enlightenment than any random human weighted on balance with time.. This is a fact. The reason it's taught otherwise has more to do with accumulation and what was, rather than anything else. Time does not move at same pace betwen realms. 

I guess, what I want you guys to understand is how much they are there for us. They're the ones that in our practice whisper to us when we lose our way and fall short. They're the ones that facilitate the most basic aspects of our ability to practice. If you've ever experienced intervention, 9/10 it's them. That is the reality of this world. 

They are us. They are every wish we ever had and the manifestation of our metta. At least, many do their best to be. I just.. want you guys to know. So often the invisible voice that brings you to the next point.. it's them. More than anything else, they are people. People who push us forward and help us overcome in our practice. It  is always them. The Dharma protectors.

Never ever look down on the gods. Many of them are buddhists and do their absolute best for the sake of others.

As lacking as I am, this at least I've seen. I guess I just wanted people to know. So, so few understand just how hard they work, what they actually do. Thank you for reading.",Buddhism,1689881064.0,t3_1550jlw,0.66,20

Unanswerable questions in the context of Buddhist cosmology,"I‚Äôve been reading some about sets of questions that the Buddha categorized as unanswerable such as a precise model of karma / its results, the ultimate origin of this universe, whether this universe is spatially infinite, the existence of a Tathagata after death, etc. I think there‚Äôs great value to be had in discerning when a question is ill-formed, unanswerable and/or untestable. I have a lot of respect for the Buddha for steering his students away from such fruitless wonderings. 

> ‚Ä¶ Some questions are skillful in that they provide a useful context for putting an end to suffering, whereas others are not. ‚Ä¶ the Buddha would answer only the questions that provided an answer to our primal question and helped put an end to suffering and stress. Questions that would get in the way, he would put aside, because the problem of stress and suffering is urgent
> ‚Äî Thanissaro Bhikku 

> The Buddha always told his disciples not to waste their time and energy in metaphysical speculation. Whenever he was asked a metaphysical question, he remained silent. ‚Ä¶ Life is so short. It must not be spent in endless metaphysical speculation that does not bring us any closer to the truth.
> ‚ÄîThich Nhat Hanh 

Given the apparent emphasis on practical teaching, what‚Äôs up with the extremely complex cosmological model in mainstream Buddhism? These claims are so beyond human experience/verification that they must be regarded as metaphysical. They are so fantastical and also specific that they are totally ascientific. Floating mansions in the air for beings that live for thousands of years ‚Äî really? Indeed, some of these realms are formless, and so there‚Äôs no material interaction to be had, no basis upon which one might design an experiment to support a testable model. And that‚Äôs totally leaving aside that these realms supposedly facilitate conscious awareness in the absence of a physical substrate. 

Why bother teaching about them? How are they useful towards the cessation of suffering? What purpose does it serve? If the point is to indicate that liberation takes a long time and nothing lasts forever, why not just say that? If they‚Äôre simply metaphors for states of mind, which seems most practical, why not just say that?

A lot of the Buddha‚Äôs teachings and very reasonable and practical, but I‚Äôm struggling to find any utility in this intricate cosmology. To take it as literally and physically real is just incomprehensible, and so far removed from the otherwise grounded and immediately applicable teachings. I get the whole arguing with the doctor about who shot the poisoned arrow and what the arrow was made of etc. Is this complex cosmological model not just yet another distraction from receiving the medicine that would end the suffering? How does it actually help any living being?

It seems to me to just be a cultural, mythological trapping. But I‚Äôm open to and eager to learn of any better explanation.

Does Anyone Know This Book on Buddhism?,"A few months ago I had asked someone to read a Buddhism book they had lying around. I've since forgotten the title and want to buy my own copy.

1. The book was a paperback written in English.

2. It talked about buddaland

4. It talked about Earth being heaven and the diety we worship is the God of Heaven.

5. It talked about the 7 levels you have to go through in life before reaching Enlightenment.

6. It talked about each day being one year. Noon = Summer, Morning = Spring Midnight=Winter, Evening = Fall

7. It talked about how those who have not learned there lesson in this life will be forced to re-live it again, and again until they do.

Sexual misconduct in the sutras,"It was my understanding that the sexual misconduct in the five precepts related to adultery, rape, or having sex with a celibate monk. I was [reading an early sutra](https://read.84000.co/translation/toh287.html#UT22084-068-021-42) from the Kangyur and was surprised to see it was against oral sex and anal sex exclusively.

> ...sexual misconduct occurs when one penetrates one‚Äôs own wife, or another man‚Äôs wife, through an opening other than the vagina, or when one rejoices in others performing such an act, or when one makes others engage in it even while refraining from doing so oneself. 

If you don't end up in hell, as an animal, or hungry ghost, this bad karma may ripen as having a disrespectful wife in the next life OR being born a [hermaphrodite](https://read.84000.co/translation/toh287.html#UT22084-068-021-59). 

I'm not a scriptural fundamentalist and I think it can often be clear which parts are political and worldly and which are truly inspired and holy. But this surprised me, especially since it does not include adultery. 

Also, Buddhism is considered to be welcoming to all people in modern times, but I can't help but wonder what a gay man or other LGBTQIA+ persons might think reading this.

enlightenment? did I achieve it as a child without knowing?,"It seems ridiculous now but, when I was a child, between the ages of 10-14 I got into a habit, whereby when I was in bed at night (no, not that habitüòÇ)  before I went to sleep I used to hold my hand up in the dark and stare at it and think about the universe and my place in it.

I did this for the first time without planning it or knowing what I was doing and I achieved a great sense of enlightenment. I was overwhelmed with the sense of it and It felt dizzying. I felt that I had done something that had a great effect on my being. I focused on my place in the universe and the complete insignificance of it. I then felt a rush throughout my body. I felt amazing afterward.


After this,  I continued to do this for a brief time in my childhood. I was excited to go to bed knowing that I was going to ""meditate"" and the rush that I would get. 
 It eventually fizzled out and I more or less completely forgot about it.

I didn't really think about it again until years later when apps like headspace and calm brought meditation back to my attention.

I have since tried guided meditation a fair bit and have found it to be very good for sleeping and to have some good mental health benefits for me but i have never been able to properly get into the state of mind that I had as a child and fully relax, or achieve and enlightenment. 

I blame this on the stresses of modern adult life such as work, marriage,  children, mobile phones etc 

I was able to fully engage without guided meditation as a child and achieve something that is still with me to this day. Whereas now I find it hard to even relax enough to organise my breathing to do a session of guided meditation on calms app.

Does suffering exist? Why isn't Buddhism monistic? How far does non-dualism go?,"I have read that Buddhism does not take anything to exist or not exist, to put it crudely. This seems to be untenable as Buddhism seems quite sure of the existence of suffering. Following that, it must be necessary for something  - with existence - to be suffering. I think therefore I am.  How far does non-dualism go? Is existence not necessary to understand anything and must be assumed?  There is not even a first step without the assumption of existence.

I came to this question because, to my understanding, Buddhism is monistic. Is Nirvana not much like Kant's Thing-In-Itself and Schopenhauer's Will, which is completely unconditioned yet can still be said to exist? I don't think the Thing-In-Itself contradicts non-self, as it is indistinguishable from any other thing. It is everything after all.

I would like some real advice on this,"I need some advice

Hello everyone! Long time lurker and first time actually posting here. I want to tell everyone a story here and I would like some opinions.



I‚Äôm going to pre-face the story with some things about myself and we can get into it from there, I am a ‚Äúwhite‚Äù (not really) man who was in the military to be exact to the infantry. Since getting out of the military and moving on to different things in my life, I have had a overhaul and a rehaul of who I am as a human being. I am a Yogi, I am a vegetarian, and I have converted to Buddhism. I am by no means perfect but I live my life as a secular Buddhist the best way I can. 


Currently I work at a small family bar and French bistro in Arizona. It is a very prosperous bar, upscale and the new thing on the block. We get immense traffic and it‚Äôs great. 


Since day one of working at this establishment, I have been met with some resistance from one of the owners nieces. She is as she puts it ‚Äúwoke, an activist, gay, a feminist‚Äù she is Hispanic, (and whiter than I, who is native and Moroccan and Portuguese but I don‚Äôt give a shit about race so I just say ‚Äúwhite‚Äù as I am fair skinned and slightly tanned) And from the first day of us meeting has made very rude comments to me that I can only subscribe as to things that would get someone immediately terminated. 

The comments first started with her telling me to my face in front of coworkers that she judges me for being a white man that‚Äôs an imperialist from the military who has committed war crimes, which of course is a straw man if I ever heard one. I wonder if she knows that I, with my unit, rescuers 100 woman out of sex slavery in Africa? Goes against her agenda so most likely not. Anyway. 

Things have slowly reached a tipping point, lastly with her telling me that it‚Äôs disgusting that a white man thinks he can be a Yogi or a Buddhist. The other day we had an incident at work where she was sticking up for a table and not the server even though the table was harassing the server to try to get free food, the table happen to be two women. As I was explaining the situation to the owner she started chiming in with small snippets about how I don‚Äôt know that table, they were nice to her, and I‚Äôm being judgmental. When I looked at her and I asked her are you doing this because I am a man and those are women or because I‚Äôm a white man and those are black women? She responded with and I quote ‚Äú you white piece of shit misogynistic motherfucker fuck you and your white family‚Äù and stormed off in front of customers. Mind you I work at a nice place, not a damn chili‚Äôs. The evidence will also show, to the kangaroo court in session, that the true colors came out when she was called out. Instead of helping and backing up her female teammate who is new, she immodestly and effectively begins to take sides when she has no idea what‚Äôs going on. It‚Äôs the most obvious case of identity politics at a ground level I have ever seen, in a damn upscale bar of all places!

After speaking with the owner, it has become apperantly that the issue is me. I‚Äôm ‚Äúwhite‚Äù, I‚Äôm a male, I‚Äôm what you would consider not a beta man (I will not use the word alpha, so cringe) but I am tall, muscular, I box, I‚Äôm kind of loud and fun. I‚Äôm your typical dude. Except I‚Äôm a philanthropist, activist, and scholar. This woman‚Äôs entire identity and her views is to be against someone like myself. She knows it, I know it, the management knows it. 



The owner became infuriated with the situation, obviously not myself but with her. My question to everyone here is this is a group of thinkers philosophers and people in the realm of law and ethics, how should I respond to this?

If this was any other race or sex of person in the roles were reversed there would be a lawsuit, full stop. 

Being that I walk or try to at least a different path in life, I will not be asking for her to be fired nor will I be asking for a lawsuit or trying to obtain any damages but my question to everyone here is how do you see the best way of going around rectifying this? Nothing I‚Äôve said here is exaggerated and it is the full spectrum of what she has said to me among other things she said. Does anyone see a real way around this?

"Brahman is real, just empty on a larger scale","So for context, I went to school to study astrophysics before getting into spirituality. Brahman as a concept always made sense with the science we see. All of matter is actually just condensed energy emerging from a latent field that permeates everything. We are like waves in the ocean, not seperate from the ocean, but made up of it. 
But I also recognize emptiness as true. Everything is dependant on everything else, there is no inherent nature to any individual. The blade of grass is as much the water it drinks, as it is the sun it grows under. But we cannot ignore that physics does tell is there is an essence in this universe. So my thought is, Brahman is real, is the energetic foundation of this universe. But this isn't the only universe, not the only Brahman. So while Brahman is real, it is empty in connection to a wider omniverse. 
Is this a thought others have had? I feel strongly drawn to Buddhism, but I cannot deny Brahman as a concept is valid. This seems like a good middle way.",Buddhism,1611775509.0,t3_l6cahe,0.45,0

Buddhism leads to the extinction of mankind,"Dhamma teaches us to overcome desire. The moral rules therefore include that one must live in complete chastity, which is totally understandable. But if all the people in the world lived according to dhamma, humanity would die out, because there would be no reproduction. And is a teaching the right one if it leads to the extinction of humanity? In my opinion: No, it isn't. I like the Buddha, I like dhamma. But this one thought is still the one that keeps me from accepting it as the truth. 
Of course, it is very unlikely that everyone in the world would follow the teaching. But it is important in morality, which you think is the right one and you want to live according to it and spread it further, to use the categorical imperative of Immanuel Kant: Act only according to that¬†maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.

"I think the beauty of music, art, and mathematics is associated with Jhana, and hints at the nature of Nirvana","I often attain Jhana, or strengthen an ongoing Jhana, by becoming absorbed in the beauty of a musical piece, an artistic work, or a mathematical insight.

The same logic which the Buddha applied to his first Jhana, applies here: it is a wholesome pleasure, entirely divorced of sensuality or any unwholesome state.

An effect so profound has to penetrate all the way to the deepest nature - to Nirvana.

I was slightly disappointed to read that Theravadin monks were forbidden from listening to music. My guess is that this is an archaic rule from a time when music had to be played live, typically in the context of some unwholesome revelry. I am sure the Buddha would not condemn a [piece like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3x18VxqdLk).

Of course, you do need a fair amount of mindfulness to clearly distinguish wholesome from unwholesome states.

"The Buddhist sangha for ""35 and Younger"" is cliquish and has a singles club feel to it. There is not sense of community here.","At the 35 and Younger Sanga, there's a cliquish feel to it.

Another thing that happened to me happened today. I see this guy whom I always say hello to and include him in my conversations. He's a very quiet guy, but I include him when I speak to others. Today, he was speaking to 2 girls, and he didn't include me. He didn't even say hey to me. He made no attempt to say hello to me either. 

The people at this sanga are interested in Buddhism because they were interested in a practice that could benefit them and make them more calm and mindful (that's the outwards reason that they give), instead of wanting to benefit OTHERS. Moreover, my suspicion is that these sanga members are very status oriented and are attending this sanga as a sort of an intellectual achievement or a source of prestige.

Is there a type of Buddhism that praises romantic attachments and love? What about sex?,"I agree with so many Buddhist ideas and philosophies, even about reincarnation.

I love my girlfriend very much and have learned to recognize the ""formless"" within her. It's not her physical body I am attached to, it's the bond we have of our souls. Unfortunately, Buddhism states that you must let go of all attachments. I simply believe that a man and woman partnership is like the yin yang and can be spiritually healing. I can understand removing the attachment, the value you think the person will add in your life, but not celibacy. Sex can be spiritually healing and rejuvenating! Why is sex condemned then?

Vast Impersonal Intelligence,"I had an intense peak experience recently, which I revisited some aspects of my previous realizations/experience.

There is a vast impersonal natural intelligence which is living you, or rather, it IS this life, this breathing, this walking, this drinking... this life of the universe, of the earth spinning, .... all an interconnected play of Dharma, of total life, intelligence, and awareness. The only blockage is simply this sense of an 'I', someone who controls will and dictates actions in life.

If you think that I am sounding like an advocate of 'God', I have to reiterate that this so called 'God' or intelligent Mind is empty of its own existence apart from Dharma (whatever sensed, experienced, cognized), is not something changeless and independent, and is not some sort of source acting behind the scenes or pulling the strings. Because this vast impersonal intelligence is so magnificent, powerful and impersonal, it can give the impression that we are all just the dream or expression of a Universal Mind of God, and if we follow this 'personification' and 'reification' we may start to think whether we are living in a matrix, a dream of Shiva for no other reason than his own enjoyment. But we are not the play or lila of a Brahman, there is no need to personify or reify this at all. This intelligence IS the miracle of manifestation. The divine has no face of its own, and yet every face is the face of divinity. There is no I, no perceiver, or a controller of this spontaneous intelligent happening. Living this is living in complete ecstasy and joy born of this total intelligence, life and clarity.

I just found something by Daniel Ingram which pretty much describes it nicely:

""Thus, sensations of effort are just sensations of effort, but imply no fundamental split off entity that is making this effort. It is just a natural product of the interdependent universe. Just so, the sense of a will is replaced with a mysterious sense of absolutely natural causality and a natural, creative ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù that operates in all of this, though the sensations that make up the sense of will continue as before. This is what is meant in the teachings of the twelve links of dependent origination when it says, ‚ÄúWith the complete cessation of [fundamental] ignorance, volitional formations cease.‚Äù Similarly, sensations of intimacy are just sensations of intimacy and simply imply proximity rather than a separate self. Those of third path know this to some degree, and those of second path can look into this to try to attain the understanding of third path. Arahats have fully understood this.""
(note: his definition of 'Arahat' is different from the suttas definition)

Also in moments of peak experience, I see we have to overcome the habitual tendencies of distracted thoughts... means we must be able to completely silent our mind and be able to have no thoughts at all to fully experience the fullness and presence of our six senses without a single trace of thought or sense of self... the trees, the sky, the breeze, everything in its complete intensity without thoughts. I'm not saying thought must be stopped at all moments, but like Eckhart Tolle said, after awakening 90% of his (unnecessary) thoughts just disappeared and thats what make a difference to his life. Without this we will not be able to feel the intensity of total Presence. So meditate and do yoga. Realization alone is insufficient without shamatha. Yes, you can experience anatta even when there are wandering thoughts because it is always already so, but one can never fully appreciate the Presence, total life, intelligence and awareness... it is a whole different level.

In other words: thoughts are ok, but you must have 'mastery' over them. Means unnecessary thoughts do not arise.",Buddhism,1427073510.0,t3_2zyq9n,0.54,1
Could Psychedelics be used to aid Buddhist practices?,"""Traditional mainstream Buddhist training does not include the use of mind-altering substances. With very few possible exceptions, they are simply not mentioned in the sutras and other texts. Some think that they are dealt with in the precept that states *""a disciple of the Buddha does not intoxicate mind or body of self or others"".* Others think differently: the same poll mentioned above found that almost 60% of the responding Buddhist practitioners felt that psychedelics and Buddhism do mix and that they would consider taking psychedelics in a sacred context (in the ""under 20"" category this percentage was 90%). The traditional understanding of intoxicants refers to all mental and physical phenomena that foster confusion through fanning our likes and dislikes. And as the Buddha never fails to point out, ultimately everybody has to decide for themselves what is what.""

There's no greater peace than the cessation of thought,"To be able to stop inner discourse is bliss.

This skill is very precious, it frees you from your own thoughts.

Free your mind from itself, from words and concepts. Understand that they are mere illusions. They are tools that can become traps.

Never remain in what is called the formless realm of thought too long, or it will trap you.

If you find yourself with your mind not being able to stand still, your sight blurry, your hearing being annoyed by any sound or word, your touch insensitive, your nose dry, your body tired and low in energy, drowsy; stay in contemplation, be still in observation. Be energetic, or it will drown you. Soon disease will attack you, emotions will be uncontrollable, and bad karma will follow. Do not panic, remember that your nature is that of the buddha, perfect and enlightened, remember there's no reason to be not ok; there's nothing we actually need, nothing that can actually affect us, we only convince ourselves deeply that it does affect us.

Stay in contemplation, assume whatever bad karma you may have created knowing that it too shall pass not in sadness, but in understanding that it's nothing but dust traveling in your path, and focus. This will take you out of samsara quick enough.",Buddhism,1394175421.0,t3_1zsipi,0.57,2
Thoughts on what buddhism is.,"The practice of buddhism is essentially the adjusting of the components of one's psychological reward system to be primarily items over which one has the most immediate dominion so that overall satisfaction--and hopefully wellbeing generally--is as accessible and reliable as possible. Additionally, developing a strong foundational reward system configuration is beneficial to the process of conducting ventures to achieve additional satisfaction in realms over which one has less dominion than the items already secured in one's psychological reward system. This is because coming at a new task from an already-existing position of strength and moderate satisfaction is more effective than an approach dominated by an attitude of desperation and weakness.

The most objective manifestation of this process is found in the practice of meditation, a process that distances the conscious mind from its normal thinking routine. This routine is that of constantly exploring, re-exploring, and over-exploring one's real or imagined needs and wants and the various urgent tasks required to achieve them. The non-meditating mind appears to be in a state of overactive commentery on one's life and anything remotely relevant to it. Some non-meditative activities, such as entertainment, are popular because they seem to distract this state of overactive commentery from doing its work on the self and onto other things. 

The difference between entertainment and meditation is that while entertainment distracts the mind from the its life by redirecting the perpetual commentery and mental activity to another object, meditation allows the mind to truly rest and regain stamina by seeking to quiet this tiring activity. To focus one's attention solely on the breath requires the mind to adjust its pace and energy from that required to integrate and interact with a complex smattering of facts and ideas to that required to merely patiently observe a slow and gentle binary physiological process. Doing this repeatedly helps nudge out items unskillfully placed in one's psychological reward system.",Buddhism,1391842024.0,t3_1xc9k3,0.45,0
Secular Humanism and Secular Buddhism,"Perhaps the biggest difference between Humanism and Buddhism is that Humanism is a set of principles to be believed and followed, and Buddhism is a path to be practiced. Essential to the notion of a ‚Äúpath‚Äù is the distinction between where we are now and where we are headed. Humanism has philosophical parents, such as the Stoics, that recall Buddhist principles, but it will perhaps be instructive (following philosophers like Owen Flanagan) to use Aristotle‚Äôs approach to ethics as an apt comparison to the Buddhist path.

For Aristotle the aim of philosophy is to bring us well-being or ‚Äúeudaimonia‚Äù. One who lives a life of eudaimonia is distinguished from the the many (‚Äúhoi polloi‚Äù), who do not aim at the highest good. Similarly, Buddhism distinguishes samsaric existence, unstable and hence unsatisfactory, from the potential to attain a more reliable state of well-being or ‚Äúnirvana‚Äù.

Unresolvable Plurality in Buddhist Metaphysics?,"The moral force of karma derives from the notion that we must live with the consequences of our actions and that even death is no barrier to the consequences being visited on us (or someone linked to us in a way we care about). It is fundamentally fear of negative consequences, particularly a bad rebirth, that pushes the unawakened Buddhist to be ethical; and the prospect of liberation from repeated death that pulls them along. This implies that the person who lives out the consequences of my present actions must in some way still be me. I must feel a sense of ownership over my actions and their consequences. In other words karma implies some kind of personal continuity or it doesn't make sense in human terms.

Ikeda's Cult of Personality Synonymous to Idol Worship within the SGI.,"A Cult of Personality tantamount to idol worship is evidenced by the extreme obsession of SGI members for their ultimate hero and frequently personal savior (otherwise known as master/mentor), Daisaku Ikeda.  Individual members will vehemently deny worshiping the ground he walks on, but close observation of the SGI membership behavior and attitude reveals how the organization consistently places a superhuman-like Ikeda high upon a pedestal of adornment, elevated far beyond all others.  Since the embarrassingly mud-slinging split between SGI (lay org) and NST (temple Org) two decades ago over control of the vast membership and its potentially enormous monetary donations, the push by SGI to establish Ikeda as absolutely essential to each member's personal practice has only deepened and intensified, further pressing home the point regarding the claims that the unelected, unselected, self-appointed, and unaccountable Ikeda and his SGI empire do indeed qualify as a religious cult. (Note: not trying to claim here that something positive can never result from associating with this organization - just pointing out some grotesquely major flaws in the organization‚Äôs dogmatic doctrines that are contradictory with the essence and spirit of Buddhism as commonly understood and accepted).  

Ikeda is presented to the members as a father figure, whose requisite guidance is absolutely indispensable to maintaining so-called ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù faith.  The CULTivation of a special magical relationship gushing with emotional devotion for Ikeda by each member is obligatory for advancement in practice and/or leadership position by SGI. This characteristic of the SGI alone should begin to set off warning bells with anyone interested in joining, as well as for those newer members not yet spell bound and ensnared by polished propaganda and constant pressure by leaders to ""make a determination‚Äù to get ""closer"" to the perpetually unapproachable master/mentor.    

Ikeda is regarded by the SGI as the equal of Gandhi and M.L. King, and in hushed tones, even as the Buddha of modern times.  He is treated with super-star status by the membership (a feat devotedly enabled by generating mentor propaganda to the membership by his organization's leaders). His books and publications fill SGI bookstores to the brim, where members are constantly pressured by leaders or through sales campaigns to buy in-house publications and to purchase subscriptions that provide enormous profits.  Members have been known to sacrifice their homes, personal finances, and life savings (and sometimes even spousal relationships) in order to provide cripplingly large and often unaffordable monetary donations during regular SGI contribution campaigns. The SGI even has a program to help arrange legal documentation so that the SGI (and consequently Ikeda) will automatically receive your estate instead of your family upon your death. Ikeda has become a multi-billionaire that has built his enormous wealth upon the backs of countless unpaid hard working, dedicated, well-intentioned, and purposefully mentally-conditioned membership, programmed to volunteer themselves into a sleep-deprived oblivion, while unknowingly advancing the unscrupulous objectives of Ikeda to obtain ever increasing amounts of wealth and power by their supposedly flawless  mentor/master.  

The SGI reinforces the artificial importance and magnitude of Ikeda in the indoctrinated minds (attending schools be they public or religious almost universally deliver indoctrinated minds) of members through many different means. One example:  the indication that no other human alive could be as awesome as Ikeda at dispensing wise and magnificent guidance. Or in another example, the unwritten direction regarding the placement of his picture directly upon their altars, or hanging beside the altar on the wall. An even more bizarre example exists in the self-surrendering acceptance of Ikeda by each member as his or her life-long master (mentor). For many decades, the overly self-indulgent Ikeda has enjoyed the jet-setting idolized rock star lifestyle of the ultra-privileged elite while hidden behind closed gates, limos, army of bodyguards, and presidential hotel suites, He has long enjoyed his celebrity status while misusing adoring disciples to serve as hand servants and vassals for his personal prestige, while steadily building his corrupt empire, financial holdings, and counterfeit appearance of legitimacy. Ikeda‚Äôs thinly disguised level of total control and influence over the minds and hearts of SGI members is appalling to the average Buddhist or the outside observer and hard as rock evidence of indulgence in cult behavior.

Soka Gakkai and Ikeda also established a powerful political party with the intention of taking control of the Japanese government‚Äôs parliamentarian Diet. Ikeda and his radical followers have been convicted of criminal interference with elections. Soka Gakkai members under Ikeda's leadership are widely known in Japan for their extreme and militant behavior, and excessively radical forced conversion methods. Furthermore, Ikeda has used his massive wealth to purchase precious artworks and to obtain a garish number of university degrees, and has used internally publicized ‚Äúdialogues‚Äù with highly recognized and influential individuals in an obtuse attempt to establish legitimacy and credibility both within and beyond his wealthy and powerful organization.  

Ikeda's carefully concealed ego and lust for power underlie his crafted meteoric rise to the top of the SGI organizational pyramid, where he commands millions (mostly in Japan) of deluded and obsessed minions as they lovingly hang upon his every word (leaders having sworn to ""give their lives"" for the continual expansion of the SGI organization, otherwise known as the twisted and tormented goal of ""World Peace"" - where Ikeda and his SGI would rule the world through their religious organization with absolute authority and power over all others.)  However, none of these aspects would be immediately apparent to anyone naively attending a discussion (conversion) meeting or being love-bombed by happily zealous Ikeda-bots into joining the SGI (because making a conversion is considered to be a massive karmic benefit for‚Ä¶  the gain-motivated member that receives credit for the conversion).  How twisted is a top-down organization that encourages over-indulgence and greed by example, including guidance to chant for anything one may desire - with little or no concern of bad karma created by unwise choices.

As death approaches for the elderly Ikeda (if not already here - how would anyone know for sure?), Ikeda‚Äôs lackluster son is being groomed to take over the leadership of the SGI in a brash move that would establish an ongoing Ikeda family dynasty of SGI presidents.  The imagined heroic martyrdom of the father will be forever established while the adoration of all SGI members would be magically transferred to his undistinguished and not so illustrious son, and would introduce a tradition similar to the current family dictatorship ruling  North Korea.  

Any one of the preceding statements regarding Ikeda/SGI should warrant serious caution and reflection, but taken together, demand extreme prudence and further independent research into the SGI and its cult behavior as exhibited by Ikeda, his SGI empire, and its self-perpetuating obsession with establishing Ikeda as the supreme mentor (master) of all Buddhists.  Regarding one‚Äôs former faith, there is NO tolerance, only lip-service to tolerance - if you've been with a different sect or religion, your old religious or meditative practices are regarded as worthless (and eventually you will be ‚Äúencouraged‚Äù to get rid of any connections to your former beliefs.)  Contrary to rhetoric, relationships with perplexed friends and family may also need to be sacrificed in the wake of following unending guidance (control) in pursuit of becoming a perfect SGI member or leader and devotee of Ikeda.

Let this be a clarion call to na√Øve marks and unsusecting potential victims tempted to listen and accept at face value the outlandish propaganda spewed out by the SGI that serves to establish their leader as the supreme practitioner of all Buddhism and every SGI members' ultimate mentor (master).  Advancing in one‚Äôs Buddhist practice cannot be so easily accomplished by unquestioningly following the guidance of a Jesus-perfect mystical leader (he magically knows when your chanting is sincere or your ichinen is pure) or a self-praising organization that declares ""we have the ONLY way to happiness for EVERYONE‚Äù (because you know - all others will fall into hell and have their heads broken into seven pieces unless they practice exactly as the SGI dictates).  The SGI misses the Buddhist mark completely with the adoration, veneration, and deification of Ikeda.  What has always been essential in Buddhism is to doubt everything, and to then discover and to follow one's own true path ‚Äì precisely the opposite of blind acceptance of a slickly packaged religious faith that dangles the proverbial carrot before hungry eyes.       

Ikeda is no Buddha. Not by any means. Ikeda's carefully concealed lifelong quest for power and wealth are not even remotely consistent with the aspirations or objectives of a Buddha.  Yet his extremely exaggerated importance and status as extolled by the SGI's dogmatic doctrines would have Ikeda's magnitude surpassing even that of the historical
Buddha.  The tenant regarding the extreme importance of  ‚ÄúIkeda as my master in life‚Äù has been inescapably encoded into the veiled (and sometimes not so veiled) doctrines of the SGI.  Furthermore, after a lifetime of purportedly perfect SGI practice, Ikeda has not attained Enlightenment. What then does that signify for the SGI members under his ultimate and supposedly infallible leadership and guidance toward the promise of attaining Buddhahood without fail in this lifetime?    

Since the (sales) pressure to join in but never leave can be tremendous yet subtle, it would be prudent for those interested in joining to first take a very close look at what is hidden under the SGI sheets before making any hasty decisions to get in bed together ‚Äì for all this unbridled Ikeda-ism presents an extreme case of  ‚Äúbuyer beware‚Äù!

Why God Became A Buddha,"I came across this book, [Why God Became A Buddha](http://www.amazon.com/Why-Became-Buddha-Metteyya-Brahmana/dp/0988708310/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1375375193&sr=8-1&keywords=Why+God+Became+a+Buddha) through a conversation on goodreads.com with the author.

I haven't read it, but it sounds very interesting, so I thought I would post a blurb about it here.

Commence blurb:

>For many of us who grew up in a theistic world of 'God', the idea of God becoming a Buddha may seem confusing and disorienting, as we tend to think of God as the creator of the physical universe and ""the Buddha"" as just a human being within this creation. And while it is certainly true that the historical Buddha (Siddhattha Gotama) was a human being just like us, this book examines his past lives as a God, his discourses to the Gods, and central teachings from the Dhamma he taught to shed light on the logic and nature of Buddhist Cosmology and its relationship to the path of spiritual liberation from the things that make us suffer.

>One may ask, how could a God who ruled the universe not be fully liberated spiritually, as the awe, overwhelming power, and genius of the physical universe appears beyond human comprehension, and therefore its ruler must have achieved the highest state of being. Complete mastery of the physical laws of the universe - the elusive goal of science - is widely considered the ultimate in human development. But through examining Buddhist Cosmology and the numerous discourses the historical Buddha gave on the nature of the God(s), we learn that the Gods were/are imperfect and addicted to form and/or sense gratification, and had many spiritual fetters that kept them bound to the gross and finer material realms of existence despite significant spiritual advancement.

What about when anger is the most appropriate emotion to feel,"Anger, many social psychologists argue, is a useful emotion. It may tell us that someone is treating us unfairly or dishonestly, bullying us, or creating intolerable situations.

Responses to one's own anger, while often very damaging, can aslo have the benefit of protecting us by letting others know that we think their behavior is not acceptable and it needs to change. If we do not tell the offendeer that, they very well may continue with the behavior that is angering us. Why should they stop if there are no consequences?

"Something happened to me tonight, and I don't think I'll ever be the same.","Earlier tonight, while waiting for the release of Black Ops 2, I smoked what my cousin told me was weed. It probably wasn't simply weed, because something happened to me that I can only describe as a 'bad trip', even though I've never done any hallucinogenics. My reality shattered. I still have no words that I know that will make the thoughts and feelings that I experienced for a few short minutes coherent enough to be
truly understood, but I can say a few things. First, it was terrifying. I believe that the moment in my life, at least up until now, in which
I experienced the most fear and/or anxiety was this one. I had no control over what was happening to me. Later, I would describe the initial minutes of what happened to me to my cousin as feeling like I was stuck in some kind of loop that only lasted a few seconds but seemed to go on for eons, only there was really no 'I'. I know that that sounds strange, but the closest I've come to putting one of the feelings that I had into English is that I felt as if I were all that is, and that everything was me, and that everything was that moment. I can remember it feeling like it took years for me to realize that the things that my cousin were saying to me were not the things he had just been saying to me. There was also this concept that was horrifying to me, something that for some reason makes me recall a word like brood or bluud. It was the concept that what was happening right now had never happened before, or something like that. I was in a car, so I started thinking about cars, and about why cars, and why people, and what are people...I'm not leaving out words, that is just the best feeling way to describe what I was thinking about. After I finally came down, and I say finally even though it only lasted about 5-8 minutes, I felt, and still feel, like something fundamental changed in me. I don't know how I ended up on /r/Zen, and then /r/Buddhism, but what I'm reading on here, in the sidebar..It's REALLY clicking. I just ordered the book Hardcore Zen by Brad Warner, since it was suggested for skeptics in a sidebar post. I don't know how Buddhism and Zen view recreational drug use, again, I'm VERY new to all this. I've been an athiest for years now, with no spiritual views, but this...is really making sense. The stuff I'm reading about like impermanence and interconectivity are making so much sense. I just want some advice. Where should I go from here? This feels like a huge deal for me right now. It feels like my life is changing.



(I left a LOT of detail out about my experience, but only because I have NO way of describing it without it being a disjointed incoherent word salad.)



EDIT: I don't really want to talk about the drug. I made this post primarily because I was in awe of how much this subreddit and the information on it are speaking to me in light of this experience.


Edit again: I don't feel like my interest was welcomed. I was downvoted because what led me to look into Buddhism was smoking something instead of consciously deciding, ""Well, seeing as how I've been an aspiritual athiest for years now, I ought to sit down for 20 minutes and think about the innate suffering in life."" Should it really matter HOW I was brought towards learning about the Buddhist teachings, just so long as I was at all, especially since life is constantly changing, people are always experiencing new things, and things are happening in new ways.

The key role of emotions in letting go of attachment,"This explanation relies on you knowing correctly what attachment is, so I will explain it first:

When we say someone is attached to something isn't because he carries it, but rather because he can't let it go. Making this difference is crucial. Here's an example: *A mail man carries a package which is very heavy to it's destination, when he arrives, he tries to leave it but he finds he's been glued to it, so when he leaves it on the ground he rises it up again with him, and he's very unhappy because he can't leave the package where it belongs.*

In this example, the mailman is ourselves, the package is anything we can hold: family, love, money, even our life... Everything that doesn't accompany ourselves after we die can be the package (whether you choose to believe there's somewhere to go after life or not, it's your choice). And the location is where we must leave this thing we are attached to; if it's our family, we must leave them when we have to make decisions by ourselves or when we have to create our own family, for example, if it's money, we must leave it when we are hurting ourselves and others, if it's love we must leave it when we are hurting the other person or are hurting ourselves.  Again, whatever you carry, be it money, family, love, fashion, pleasure, melancholy , anything, even things you consciously know are attachments themselves... It's ok to carry it, as long as you can leave them when you must.

I hope you understood attachment, if you have questions you might ask in comments. 

Now, if that is clear, we must understand what causes attachment to be able to let go of all attachments.

An attachment happens when we are overrun by one emotion, thus by this saturation, the other emotions seem to disappear and we seek to perpetuate this state. Actually all emotions are always there (in potential of being experienced) but since we seek to perpetuate this state we ignore the chances we have to experience them.

The next logical question would be ""why we seek to perpetuate this"". The answer is: because it's comfortable, and comfort is ego wanting to perpetuate itself as it is now. Explaining it a bit further: Since all material things face change one day or another anything (again, material) that attempts to perpetuate itself immobile (or immutable) will begin to face decay when change happens. Thus, ego must always destroy itself and rebuild itself, in this particular way (too) ego doesn't exist, since each time you look it's always something different. But ego is a whole different subject.

So, going back a few steps, the reason, or rather, the happening that causes attachment to happen is being overrun by one emotion, thus choosing to be blind to the other emotions. So, the solution of attachment would be quite simple: Seeking other emotions. But some times it's not like that so I'll explain a bit further.

We seek happiness in our lives, and particularly in buddhism like seeking to be ""white"". In what sense? We seek to be white while illusorily thinking that white is a color on it's own, we think this because we see always the result, not the process. Since white isn't made of ""white"", like blue is made of blue, which is indivisible into other colors, white is made of all the colors mixed in the same amount. By this example, happiness isn't aiming to be happy, but rather experiencing every emotion in the same amount as our choices lead us to experience them, without ever lingering in one and allowing it to overcome our will, of course unless we chose to (which in such case, it isn't overcoming our will). We usually avoid emotions like anger, sadness and anxiety, but these emotions are all part of the cycle, and we can't ignore them if we want to be happy and free.

Going back to the subject, we can't seek other emotions since now we want to preserve this emotional state and we are in samsara. We hold a problem inside us so *we must give it a solution*. All problems must be solved in our mind, or else they will haunt us.

In this there are two cases:

- If the problem can be solved, the solution is facing the problem, which will lead to experiencing the emotion further, then experiencing a new emotion.

- If it can't, which then would mean it's somebody else's problems since only the problems that are not our own can't be solved by ourselves... Then we must accept that we can't solve it, learn and simply forget about it.

In these ways we will release ourselves from the emotions and thus allow ourselves to jump to the next one, never attaching to one emotion, cycling thru all of them, thus being ""white"" or happy. I hope this was clear.

That was the long explanation, the short one is: live in the present, altho not throwing away your future.

Hope you found this useful.

How should a Buddhist fall asleep?,"The only way I can fall asleep normally is to 'turn-off' my Buddhism.  Go back to automatron and stop mindfulness, stop awareness and breathing meditation.  

I would not sleep for days if I continued to be 'fully' Buddhist.

What happens if I don't turn off is I will eventually meditate into a trance, and then into a semi lucid state, where maybe I'll fall asleep but more likely blast into an out of body experience.  This SUCKS because it is very uncomfortable.

So my question is for experienced Buddhists, on falling asleep.  Techniques / Tips much appreciated.

Thanks ^^

Is secular Buddhist identity - Thoughts,"I know we've had some discussion on the impact of secular Buddhism on Buddhist discourse a few days ago, and I'd like to take a slightly different angle of reflection: is the Secular Buddhist identity a coherent one? I would argue no through a series of reflective exercises:

**Definitions of words** ***can't work for 'everyone'***

Claiming that the term *Buddhist* needs to be inclusive (of atheists, materialists etc), is illogical, since one of the functions of a noun, is to ***delineate*** an object in the world ***from other objects/phenomena***. This makes *productive communication possible*. 

So when we say *Buddhist,* we mean a member (nominal or otherwise) of the Buddhist religion. *So we know immediately*, by the use of that term, ***we are not talking*** about: Atheists, Quakers, or Salafi Muslims or Santeria devotees etc. 

The term Buddhist, if it is to remain a ***coherent*** term, *must exclude*, those who are *not* Buddhist.

Now we know from previous threads, secular Buddhist ideologues have time and again, made their commitments to atheistic, scientistic materialism very clear: ***by their own conviction and insistence***. 

So the plea that they *also be seen* as a ""type"" of Buddhist is incoherent and schizophrenic.  

**So who is a Buddhist?** 

Well, Lord Buddha had a very [succinct answer](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an08/an08.025.kuma.html) to this: 

>""Venerable sir, in what way is one a lay follower?""  
>  
>""Mahanama, inasmuch as one has gone to the Buddha for refuge, has gone to the Dhamma for refuge, has gone to the Sangha for refuge; in that way, Mahanama, one is a lay follower.""

And today in 2022, this formula of Refuge remains part of all devotional practices, *regardless of school.* Buddhists in Myanmar, Tibet, Japan and Indonesia ***do not share*** language, culture or diet, but what they do share, is that Refuge formula (and an array of other practices and precepts).

So Buddhists *can be identified* not by (what are by now) nebulous concepts like: ""mindfulness"" or ""meditation"", but by ***their commitment*** *(nominal or otherwise)* ***to the Three Jewels/Triple Gem***.

In other words, *where you place your faith* determines if you're a Buddhist or not.

**""But no one owns the word Buddhism!""**

The issue really has nothing to do with ownership (a red herring), but with *coherence and harm*. 

Like many Buddhists have said in last weeks thread, perpetuating the idea that atheistic materialists/sceptics are Buddhists (when they say they are) has an impact on historically Buddhist communities, particularly those in settler colonial states (like the US and Australia). 

And by insisting that Buddhism is a ""non-religion"" (another outdated, nonsensical claim), *actual Buddhists can be denied their rights to religious liberty/recognition*.

So claiming you're Muslim when you're not,  (and speaking over actual Muslims) is harmful to Muslims, the same goes for Buddhists.

""**But I can call myself what I want!""**

Yes you can :) But that right *runs both ways*: based on the precedent of 2600 years, ***I also get to respond*** to claims about identity, as it pertains to my religious tradition. A wise black women once said: ""If the glove can't be worn *both ways*, the entire enterprise is a sham.""

""**But you're persecuting me!""**

The hyperbole: I find it especially delicious when secular Buddhist ideologues invoke (mistranslated) suttas to appeal to ""logic and reason"", but when Buddhists seek to test their various claims (through our established epistemologies), we've somehow set up an inquisition to ""persecute"" them. 

This is a huge red flag for me personally, since uncharacteristically for ""Buddhists"", they're pleading for their ideas ***not to be scrutinised*** (under threat of being called a zealot of course!)

\-------------

Ladies and gents, I think as the pressure continues to mount (I'll do my bit in that department) around this issue, we will see many largely abandon the unskilful use of the label *Buddhist*. More and more people are now better educated around the orientalism and fetishisation that lies at the foundations of this strange ideology.

Secular Buddhism is starting to age as badly as those old Judd Apatow movies from the 2000s. It just feels outdated, when you look at how far we've come in globalising Buddhist discourse here.",Buddhism,1665913179.0,t3_y5co8r,0.61,8
A closer look at Secular Buddhism and Cultural Appropriation,"Hi guys, so I have another article on Secular Buddhist movement. I'll share it here in its entirety for comments/discussion. Thanks!

Full article below:

As part of my series in critiquing the Secular Buddhist movement, I thought it worthwhile to take a deeper look at the phenomenon of cultural appropriation, by taking a look at how we define culture. One of the claims of the Secular Buddhist movement is that culture can be separated from ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù. Now, let‚Äôs begin by having a look at the definition of culture and cultural appropriation and see whether this particular feat is possible.

For my analysis, I‚Äôll look at two definitions of the word ‚Äúculture‚Äù as listed in the [Oxford Learners Dictionaries](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/culture_1):

Definition one states that culture is/are: *the customs and beliefs, art, way of life and social organization of a particular country or group.*

Definition four states that culture is/are: *the beliefs and attitudes about something that people in a particular group or organization share.*

For the definition of cultural appropriation, I‚Äôll be using an article from [NCCP.org](https://nccp.org/):

**Cultural Appropriation:** *‚ÄúTaking intellectual property, traditional knowledge, cultural expressions, or artifacts from someone else's culture without permission. This can include unauthorized use of another culture's dance, dress, music, language, folklore, cuisine, traditional medicine, religious symbols, etc. It's most likely to be harmful when the source community is a minority group that has been oppressed or exploited in other ways or when the object of appropriation is particularly sensitive, e.g. sacred objects.‚Äù* (Who Owns Culture? Appropriation and Authenticity in American Law; Susan Scafidi)

So we can see that: cultural appropriation refers to a phenomenon where dominant groups can change the very meanings of the cultural capital of other non-dominant groups and thereby marginalising the source community.

Now, let‚Äôs look at some claims in the FAQ section from the [Secular Buddhism website](https://secularbuddhism.org/faq/). I‚Äôve placed the entire section on appropriation here, and as you will see, problematic ideas around culture become immediately apparent, when placed alongside the Oxford Learners Dictionaries definition:

>2.We reject the appropriation of Asian/Diasporic culture/s as part of engagement with the Dhamma  
You will see many references to separating the Dhamma from specific Asian/Diasporic cultures.

Given the dictionary definition of culture, one has to wonder in what way is separation of ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù from Asian/Diasporic culture (or say any other culture) even possible? If my point is not immediately apparent, allow me to tug at this particular conceptual thread a bit more:

If definitions one and four apply to all human communities, it stands to reason that culture is an inevitable by-product of all these human communities, whether religious or secular. So then again, the question is, how is it possible that a separation of ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù is possible from culture?

For this to be possible, the following phenomenon should be scientifically observable and demonstrable:

1. That certain groups of humans are devoid of culture,
2. which puts them in a position to extract ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù from another group of humans who have a culture.

If that is the claim, then we must ask, how do these humans attain the state devoid of culture? Is there some facet of their development that renders them thus? Could it be linked their ‚Äúsecular‚Äù worldview? If so, how does the secular worldview render these humans immune to generating culture, as defined in the Oxford Learners Dictionary? Would it not make more sense to claim that ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù moves ‚Äì through the concerted effort of individuals and groups ‚Äì from one cultural context to another?

So in my view, the claim that ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù is separable from culture, is not only impossible as an ontological claim, but also obscures the implicitly religious claim: that ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù is a set of transcendent truths that exist outside of time, space and culture and that it can be extracted/mined from those who remain mired in culture.

At this point, we can see that we‚Äôve moved far from a ‚Äúsecular‚Äù worldview to an explicitly religious one. This is a particularly curious position for the Secular Buddhist movement to hold. Is Secular Buddhism even a secular movement at it‚Äôs foundation? If the claim is yes, given the claims about culture and Dhamma above, what renders it so? Surely it can‚Äôt hinge on the existence of devas and rebirth etc, since many Heritage Buddhism(s) place little to no emphasis on these phenomena.

>Unfortunately, these are often read as attacks on those cultures; it is claimed that this separation is due to an aversion to these cultures or as a preliminary step to appropriation. Truthfully, some of the confusion is our fault.

Actually, as far as I can tell, this has not been the claim at all. The claim has been, that existing Buddhist traditions have been subject to the colonial gaze, framing these traditions as a degeneration of a pure unadulterated version located in the distant past. In fact, Western, normative narratives/histories of ‚ÄúBuddhism‚Äù, are essentially those of degeneration and contamination. This is why we still see the widespread misunderstanding of Vajrayana and Mahayana Pure Land teachings as ‚Äúlater‚Äù, degenerate forms of a ‚Äúpurer‚Äù form of Buddhism.

This Western, colonial gaze continues to frame living Buddhist traditions as simply collections of moribund rituals and superstitions. And that ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù can be extracted, to be spirited off to lands where humans have no culture, to forever exist there in pristine glory, far from the mindless religious and superstitious masses.

However, many non-Asian Buddhists continue to practice Buddhism(s) in their traditional forms while applying creative innovations to reach people from other cultural milieus. This makes perfect sense, as the task in rendering ‚ÄúBuddhism‚Äù intelligible to others, will require cross-cultural understanding, religious literacy and most basic of all, that Buddhist ideas ‚Äì in this process ‚Äì are shifting/moving from one cultural context to another.

>We haven‚Äôt been able to find the right words to express ourselves. (However, we‚Äôre going to try here and now:)  
The opposite is actually true. We do not wish to appropriate these cultures with our practice of the Dhamma. For those of more European descent, this prevents a repetition of historical harms.

If this is the case, my recommendations would be the following:

1. Redress of the historical harms that have been done to heritage Buddhists,
2. acknowledging that cultural adaptation and exchange is actually what should be happening
3. Disavow ‚Äì in theory and practice ‚Äì the harmful idea that ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù can be separated from cultures

>For those of more BI/POC descent, this allows us to engage with the Dhamma without dealing more harm to our already harmed (by Imperialism) cultures (i.e. there is a responsibility to uphold our own cultures to combat harm to those cultures that the adoption of Heritage Buddhist forms can interfere with).

Once again, the same misunderstanding is repeated here. The issue for Heritage Buddhists, is not that ‚Äúpeople from one culture should not participate in the culture of another‚Äù. That position, is not only impossible, but is in fact a straw man of the phenomenon of cultural appropriation, largely perpetuated by those who refuse to intellectually engage with these issues and cast negative aspersions on Heritage Buddhists who raise concerns they deem valid.

>And for Asian/Diasporic Secular Buddhists specifically, this allows practice of forms that are not specific to their specific ethnicity without similar issues around appropriation and harm to the practitioner‚Äôs culture (i.e. a person of Thai heritage could explore elements of Zen without issues that might otherwise arise).

The example above is logically unsound, as Zen Buddhism, is very much the historical contribution of Chinese Buddhists. Chinese cultural engagement with Indic ideas, literally gave the world the basis of the Zen traditions we know today. Again, people of different cultures sharing practices is not the definition of cultural appropriation.

>This is why we seek a separation of specific cultures from the Dhamma ‚Äì to prevent appropriation and to facilitate access to the Dhamma by those of BI/POC descent (who otherwise may have to choose between the Dhamma and healing their cultures) ‚Äì and NEVER as a form of erasure.

As the reader can see above, once again, the magical claim is made regarding separating the dhamma from specific cultures.

>The Asian/Diasporic peoples who started and maintained (i.e. transmitted) Buddhist Forms for millennia, allowing for Secular Buddhism to eventually arise ‚Äì our Dhamma ancestors ‚Äì have our deep and explicit gratitude for that and always have. (And, again, part of that gratitude is making sure that we do NOT harm cultures with appropriation as part of our practice of the Dhamma.)

Here we can see a carefully crafted paragraph meant to give the reader the impression that the secular Buddhist movement is simply another school of Buddhism. I will not delve into the doctrinal issues (in this article at least) that make the above claim problematic. I will say, that from the authors point of view, the Secular Buddhist movement seems to require this association, to position themselves as legitimate heirs to the extant Buddhist traditions that have their wellspring in Asia.

The fact that a vast (and growing number) of Buddhists (regardless of heritage), by and large do not recognise them as such, should make us pause and reflect on what is actually being peddled as Buddhist Dhamma ‚Äúwithout culture‚Äù. It is the authors opinion, that **the Secular Buddhist movement is ‚ÄúBuddhist‚Äù only in so far as association with an ‚ÄúAsian religion‚Äù can add legitimacy and orientalist mystique to their particular quasi-religious movement**.

So, to some up: the claim that ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù can be separated from cultures **renders the cultural biases of those engaged in this magical process invisible**. It renders *their assumptions* of what constitutes ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù and what does not, opaque. **Who** gets to decide what constitutes the ‚Äúcore‚Äù of a tradition and what cultural conditioning is at play when making these decisions?

Buddhists, heritage or not, should be willing to engage this movement with the difficult questions it repeatedly refuses to answer. Secular Buddhists continue to build institutions, invoking the name of a world religion, of which they claim to be ‚Äì simultaneously ‚Äì members and secular detractors of. This astounding position makes perfect sense if one factors in cultural appropriation, driven by materialist, scientistic, capitalist concerns and reinforced by [orientalism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Orientalism), a form of racial essentialism.

99% sure I've attained to Stream Entry AMA!,"Hi all at /r/Buddhism!

First off, I've decided to write this purely to stir things up a little - to convince people as best I can that SE is possible in this very life, and not after spending years living in Tibetan caves either! 

How I did it/my meditation history: I began meditating in late 2009, so less than 4 years ago. Back then I practised very irregularly - maybe once or twice a week IIRC. I will say that I did seem to always have quite an appetite for meditation even at such an early stage. I think I pretty much always practised in hour-long sessions, not without difficulty, but my point being there was some natural aptitude towards still-sitting, solitude and introspection. 

For over two years I devoted myself to practicing samatha, with my goal being the first jhana. It wasn't bloody easy. There were many, many disappointing sits and times where I was forced to change tack, realising that you don't just brute force your way beyond a light first jhana, which was the furthest I could get, using a forced-breathing technique (no doubt millenia-old) that I discovered. 

What really pointed me in the right direction (though I believe could easily have sent me on a years-long sort of fool's errand, based on what I've read of other people's accounts) was a ten-day Goenka retreat I did around April of last year. This left me convinced that a return to unforced breathing was the only way forward samatha-wise, and also in retrospect was when I first crossed the 'Arising and Passing Away' stage of Mahasi Sayadaw's progress of insight map. I spent that summer practising samatha two hours a day, figuring that a solid grounding in concentration practice would give me the best chance of landing Stream Entry in daily life (I was not prepared or able to drop out of normal life to do it, though of course there were many times when I wished I could). 

The effects of the 'dark night' or 'knowledges of suffering' stages also started to set in. This involved a slow, steady descent into complete anhedonia (something I'm still living with to this day), accompanied with regular low moods, apathy, strong aversion, loss of connection with emotions (though I do wonder if some of these are unrelated and simply the result of my life being unusually difficult as the latter of these also remains with me) and a general sense of everything I thought I could rely upon/cling to was crumbling apart in my hands ‚Äì a real process of purification, of being left with nothing but oblivion, and in the end wanting nothing more than to surrender to it.

The anhedonia I think played an especially important, and probably helpful, role as I think I may have being getting jhana by late summer and simply not realizing, though it could also have simply been a very strong pre-jhana ‚Äòaccess concentration‚Äô. Either way I‚Äôll take a brief detour here to explain what worked for me in finally making substantial/lasting progress in samatha:

* Incorporating mindfulness into my sits. This is enormously important. At this point I see it as one of the two key aspects of success in samatha, the other being mental stillness.
* Developing a mind ‚Äòinclined to abandoning‚Äô ‚Äì realizing that ‚Äòyou‚Äô don‚Äôt ‚Äòdo‚Äô jhana. It‚Äôs entirely a process of letting go, making less and less effort. Ideally I think the mind should be allowed to naturally sort of reset to attention on the breath, not be pulled back there. Though I‚Äôm aware that it‚Äôs also not about never doing anything. Maximum effiency for me then (post-SE it‚Äôs a whole different ballgame) involved knowing when to allow the ‚Äòdoer‚Äô to step in and make a slight tweak, say to re-establish mindfulness if it had become dulled, or change the width of attention‚Ä¶
* Finding a width of attention that worked for me. That meant focusing on the sensations that made up my head generally, and especially those of mental movement and concentration. This I think is especially powerful as a kind of positive-feedback reinforcement loop is created where the more one concentrates, the more one has to notice. It also helps sustain the benefits of the following‚Ä¶
* Taking a few seconds to objectify/see the three characteristics in sensations of my head and temporarily root-out the sense of self or centerpoint, really helping to speed up the solidification as otherwise the self can start to panic and squirm as concentration encroaches on it.

With all of these employed my early-jhana/access concentration could be really ramped up so that by Christmas I was getting super-intense mental solidification where the five hinderances were totally stamped out through the sheer brunt of concentration. Then over three days I went from a very obvious and sustainable first jhana, to the first four the day after, to all eight the day after that, albeit these were still quite light and wouldn‚Äôt qualify by Ajahn Brahm‚Äôs and a lot of people‚Äôs definitions of jhana, and five to eight may not qualify by less-strict standards either as they weren‚Äôt truly formless ‚Äì I could still sense my body, hear and think, etc. But they did clearly align with the names of ‚Äòboundless space‚Äô, ‚Äòneither perception nor yet non-perception‚Äô etc., so I do consider them valid attainments.

By January of this year the dark night was really hitting hard, or maybe my ability to endure it was wearing thin. I started ruthlessly investigating reality around then mainly out of desperation. There was no formal meditation technique involved that I‚Äôm aware of ‚Äì I couldn‚Äôt abide the idea of starting from scratch with some new technique I think (body-scanning from what I‚Äôd read wasn‚Äôt effective for getting path). So maybe once a week, usually at my lowest ebb, I would try to unravel the sense of a centerpoint. This involved:

* Pretending I was in the stage of ‚Äòequanimity regarding formations‚Äô (and indeed this often left me there) and trying to be as inclusive as I could in objectifying the sensations that made up reality for me, really hitting at the false sense of duality until all seemed to become one and the centerpoint was part of it.
* Riding the jhanic arc up to ‚Äòeighth‚Äô and residing there as long as I could, trying to attain ‚Äòhard‚Äô jhana as best I could, stewing in fourth jhana‚Ä¶ doing anything I thought would boost concentration, then beginning the investigation.
* Pretending the observer was outside looking in, pretending an arrow or bullet was being shot right through my skull, destroying my self.
* Seeing bodily sensations as not just not self, but not me at all ‚Äì more like any other object. This was an important turning point I think.

What I believe helped me get there:

* A strong (though not exceptional or anything) intuition that was always running in the background during meditation, throwing up insights.
* A thorough clobbering from the dark night until as I said I wanted nothing more than oblivion ‚Äì in other words, I was a little bit suicidal.
* Not obsessing over dissolving coarse sensations until the body was entirely vibrating particles, as Goenka would have you do, but having confidence that I was seeing the impermanence, suffering and not-self in everything anyway.
* Hanging out on forums like the DhO and Kenneth Folk dharma where attainments are discussed openly and there‚Äôs a strong message that this can be done by lay people in years, not decades.
* Having the self-knowledge to focus on concentration over dry insight, knowing that my awareness doesn‚Äôt naturally flit quickly from one thing to another, etc.
* Realising that the three characteristics apply just as completely post-SE as pre. Getting to a point where I only wanted to attain this in order to better help others. Thinking my way out of the trap of anticipation of path.

So I kept this up for about 3 months, practicing samatha daily and vipassana once or twice a week. Then, early this month, feeling thoroughly fed up with everything one night and turning to vipassana for an hour or so before going to bed, I was laying there in bed ‚Äì I say I but at this point there was no I, just a mass of atoms not anticipating or doing anything or locating themselves on any map ‚Äì when I decided to focus on bodily sensations, remembering that Goenka advised doing this while on retreat (I think?). After I believe no more than a few seconds of this, just beginning to relax after a long day, there was a sudden, bright flash of light and a discontinuity - not exactly pleasant, probably entrance through a suffering door ‚Äì followed by a shower of warm, tingling sensations through my head. No pleasure of course due to the anhedonia. 

I don‚Äôt think I jumped to conclusions but just laid there. It was anticlimactic. But very soon I started to cycle and before I went to sleep I must have completed four or five cycles through nanas 4 to 12, then 15. It did seem to be nana 16, the ‚Äòreview‚Äô stage, though I was still skeptical. The following two weeks saw the following, which left me convinced:

* Regular cycling that sped up when I stopped to pay close attention to it.
* A sudden increase in samatha skills ‚Äì I can now simply drop ‚Äì not do much of anything ‚Äì and end up in jhana. Indeed the cycling meant I was only seconds off a light jhana.
* A jump in perceptual ability ‚Äì seeing vibrations in equanimity in daily life without even trying. Easily dissolving blind areas where I struggled before.
* A transparency and increased sense of things unfolding as they always have. Just a general reduced sense of there being a self at the controls of this body.
* An increase in intelligence, or maybe just a return to my pre-dark night intelligence level, which was so long ago I‚Äôve almost forgotten what I was like then.
* Much-reduced feelings of craving and aversion towards anything.
* Much-reduced capacity to become even slightly irritated or stressed out by anything.
* ‚Ä¶in other words, a quite significant reduction in general suffering that makes it all worthwhile.
* I believe reproducible fruitions are also a sure sign, though not diagnostic. I‚Äôve found them tough, though not impossible, as all sense of self and doer needs to be completely out of the picture for them to happen.

I write these in the past tense because I‚Äôve since begun a new progress of insight for second path, so it‚Äôs all died down a bit and gotten confusing as to which nana I‚Äôm in.

Ok, so maybe I‚Äôve just answered most of the questions people would be interested in asking me. If you have any left, I‚Äôd be glad to field them!

Is cheating always BAD KARMA and wrong?,"  

Hi,

Is cheating always BAD KARMA and wrong?

I and this girl I like started getting physically intimate recently and she is in a relationship. Now this is cheating I understand. But I wanted to understand if with added context, is it still wrong or is it less wrong or something.

She has had emotionally abusive and in general bad relationships especially with one ex trying to commit suicide when she wanted to break up with him. 

About a year back she met this guy whom she liked and within a few months of meeting once a month physically\[rest of the times on phone\], the guy‚Äôs father died and he begged her to commit to the relationship because he really needs it right now and she did. Since then it has turned into this unhealthy thing of him trying to control her and tell her how she should feel, and to make her talk to his mother for long durations in which the mother \[who is a psychologist by the way\] would vent out her life‚Äôs troubles on this girl for hrs sometimes. She has difficulty saying no due to various reasons and just tries to not confront and can‚Äôt deal with her boyfriend getting angry and shouting and is v afraid that he will self harm if she ends things and doesn‚Äôt want to be the cause of that.

I know talking to her that she doesn‚Äôt want to be in the relationship but she really cant confront or take any decision right now in the midst of studies and all. She wants to be physical and close with me. But she said that she really cant end things right now. I know she doesn‚Äôt secretly talk to him or anything, she just gets scared by him and his mother and tries to talk just enough to avoid them or avoid being shouted or guilted at. My bonding with this girl is something I really cherish. I have been honest with her that this is unhealthy and she says she understand but needs time, she cant bring herself up to end things right now.

Now I am caught up in a dilemma. Should I stop being physical with her, is it wrong even with the above context? Or should I continue being close with her because we have a good bond and she is like a healing presence for me, the first one for me till date. Am I generating bad karma for myself being with this girl sexually?

I apologise in advance if this is v na√Øve and things are obvious, this is my first time being close with any girl.

Thank you for reading till now:)

Rock Bottom,"I came to Pattaya (which is the world's biggest brothel) in Thailand to enjoy the girls, but I ended up hitting rock bottom, alone in my hotel room crying. Not because I was lonely or was rejected. I had all the fun and sex I expected. Money will literally fullfil your wildest sexual fantasy ever imagined. And you will not understand what lengths mankind do to satisfy themselves.

I always refuse/try to ignore the Noble truths, because I refuse to give up what I have and what I will have. However I cannot turn a blind eyes to what I experienced next.

Yestersay, I took a cheap bar girl to my hotel, let's call her Fern, as the night progressed, we had a lot of fun together. But at the same time, I learned to know about the guys Fern slept with and how her life is being a bar girl. Eventually I understood that even though she's is 27, her mental age is like 17 and is used by men of all ages as a sex toy including me, stringed by promise of money and especially the promise of true love. For example she tells me about the guys who started out as her lover but then started beating her, but she endured in the hope of he being the one. You can literally see a life devoid of love and full of exploitations. But who would ever love a bar girl? So do I, I only wanted Fern for the holes she has. I never believe in love anyway (love often blinds people). So I gave her the money, she leave in sadness of separation and I go mongering for other beautiful prostitutes.

Fast forward to today, I spend around 700 bucks having a blast at various brothels. I had the blast of my life, I saw hundred of amazingly sexy girls stripping throughout the day. I used some prostitutes to what ever I fantasized. Most of them did not like it but do it because of financial needs. But who cares right? I know they didn't like it but I ignore what they feel anyway. In the mean time, Fern, the girl I used last night, started to posting statuses about how fucked love is which I immediately know is about me. Even thought I paid her, we had genuine fun and did really connected but I ditched her and listened to my dick like always. At last I took another girl home and used her until I no longer can and kicked her out of the hotel.

 Then the reality started sinking in. This have been in the back of my mind for the whole time but I wanted to turn a blind eye to it. I started to realize how serious the suffering of these prostitutes I used. They are mostly young girls employed by bars aimed to roll in as much money to the owner as possible. They will do whatever degrading things you wanted, if you give them money. Call me a hypocrite, but if you ask me how bad the future of these girls will be, I would say they have no future. I started to realize that these girls have hopes and dreams, just like I do. That Fern the bar girl also has hopes and dreams, she wanted to have a confidence, well off foreign guy like me (I can be quite charming to girls and manipulative as well). But the difference between me and her is, my future has a chance of success, I will be wealthy, will marry a beautiful wife, and hers has none. She will spend every single day in her life dreaming about a good husband while being used by men like me until the day she turns old and discarded by society. I don't blame her, to survive here is tough and selling your body can make you decent money.

I started crying. The great but short fun I have with these prostitutes is over, but what will remain after that? Fern is literally the result of countless exploitations, which I AM THE CREATOR OF ONE. While I was enjoying the new girl, Fern was once again grieving about a guy she connected with ditching her again, and have once again learned that it is best to not falling in love being a prostitute. 

I feel so heartless. It makes me feel sickened how I did the same thing with other girls, only using them for their bodies. I am stuck in a cycle of continuously creating sufferings while seeking for pleasures and her in an endless cycle of suffering while providing it. And the roles shall be swapped.

Why was I born with such an insane sexual desire that I have to do these kind of things? I am so conflicted. I am selfish in nature, I won't abandon my needs but at the same time, I can no longer turn a blind eye, especially to the one you have connected and choose to ignore but you can't. I tried to enjoy the girls and drink a bit to ignore the problem, but I can't.

I hope that was my lesson. That I have had enough and end that cycle. I do not want to see girls like Fern suffering anymore. And me suffering because of the unfulfillment of my desire.

I think I loved Fern, she is only an innocent girl. However, I know money is not the solution, I will not sponsor her and sends money to Thailand like many foreign men do with the hope to wife her.  I still have a few days with her and I will be gone forever. I will pay her the cheap daily price, while at the same time broaden her knowledge about what I know about the world, taking her to go do charities with me, and to the temples. I hope with this she can get out of this cycle by her own. After those days I will not be back.

I know there will be still some of my selfish motives with Fern's body. That is the conflict. But I can inspire her, even as a lover for a short time. I truly want good for her too, that I will not lie.

But im afraid do I have high hopes?
Would it create more suffering as I once again lead her on? Would it fall on deaf ears? Should I just focus on my own actions first?

"Banned from /r/Buddhism for quoting one of the mod's (Bobba Phet) malicious private messages. Some of Bobba's words: ""Fuck off asshole ignorant fuck face""
","I was recently debating (that is being generous with the nature of the discussion) one of the mods here in a thread about a shakespeare quote. 

He originally went back and deleted only the spiteful responses, but now I see he has gone back and deleted all of them. IDK if mods can see deleted comments, but I know at least one other board member (lvl_5_laser_lotus) saw some of the comments as I discussed them a bit with him (http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/y5w3x/awakening_and_psychedelic_drugs/c5topoi). Like I said there, I really was trying not to make this a big deal - I don't want Bobba Phet to feel unwelcome here. At the same time, when I see him making others feel unwelcome because they are drug users (which I am as well, and I refuse to be made to feel badly about it by anyone but myself), I just can't abide that - when someone sees he is a mod, and look at his comment karma, they may assume he is an authority on Buddhism. He is not - or at least not in any kind of Buddhist practice. His own words are all the proof one needs. 

And so when I see him disparaging people for exploring their mind with substances, I feel the need to raise the counterpoint ""Hey this guy clearly doesn't know what he's talking about, he is not practicing what he is preaching"" by quoting the private messages he sent me after our discussion on the Shakespeare quote. I don't want him banned - I just feel very strongly that he should not be a moderator. If nothing will be done about this, then I'm going to stop coming here. I know that probably doesn't mean anything to any of you, but it means something to me. There are few places in real life, much less the internet where you can have thoughtful discussion without it devolving into petty arguments. I thought this was one such place, but apparently as it sits I was wrong. 

I fully admit, that towards the end of the original thread that spawned all this, I lost my patience a bit, and made some condescending/insulting statements. But you'll just have to take my word that it is a fraction the vitriol that was being spewed at me which was being reflected in my statements. 

Which is not an excuse, but rather some context. And like I said in the thread, I'm not really ashamed of any of it, and that is why it is still there - Bobba Phet cannot say the same of his comments. 

Anyways here is the full exchange of private messages which took place, the posting of which prompted my being banned. (posting in first comment reply because it's too long)


Hopefully it will result in something other than this account being banned. If you have any questions feel free to message me at my main account - sh3rog. Unfortunately I cannot post here under that identity.

It's a good thing identity is meaningless

**EDIT**

So bobbaphet (or another mod IDK honestly the mods seem to be in collusion a bit in my opinion, given that Bobba had to notify them about my banning)

**""Check the Sidebar"".**

How do I start with...?

**""Check the Sidebar"".**

excuse while I don my Hardliner hat.

""Check the Sidebar"" has to be the laziest, BS answer anyone can give when somebody comes here, asking questions about Buddhism.

to me, ""Check the Sidebar"" says that the commenter does not give enough of a shit to provide an actual answer. It indicates nothing, it says nothing. 

When somebody asks you for advice within your realm of knowledge, do you say: ""I don't care enough to answer, ask somebody else""? When somebody needs help from you , do you tell them that you don't care enough to share your own experience?

THAT's what I see when ""Check the Sidebar"" comes up. Instead of a column of resources that we could pick out in order to answer a question, it has become a crutch that further breaks our legs. I am not advocating that we remove it, but I do not believe that it exists so that people don't have to think about their answers.

When any Lama, Roshi, or what-have-you gives a Dharma talk, they're not just reciting some party lines, or beleaguering a go-to sutra, they are necessarily sharing their experience, and that's all they can do. Otherwise they may as well all say ""Check the Sidebar"" and wash their hands of helping anybody. 

All this talk about compassion and it seems that some don't care enough to give a response a full ten minutes of their time and effort. I don't care if you hate what I'm saying, as long it gets stuck in your head, and forces you to reflect before vomiting out that same tired crap.

"""Is Buddhism against Birth Control?"" (Master Sheng-yen, ""Orthodox Chinese Buddhism"" 3.23)","*3.23 Is Buddhism against Birth Control?*

This issue has yet to be discussed widely in Buddhist circles. In accordance with the basic principles of Buddhism, as long as one does not break the precept against killing a person by having an abortion, there is no reason to oppose birth control. Birth control is moral if it is done to improve the children‚Äôs quality of life and education, or to avoid financial burden.

Abortion is strictly forbidden in Buddhism and is considered equivalent to killing a human being. It does not matter whether the aborted fetus has developed recognizably human features or not; any abortion is the same as killing a person. So Buddhism is opposed to birth control through abortion.

So we need to investigate the various techniques of birth control.

MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhists believe that the intermediate-state body (*zhongyin shen*) (the spirit-body in the stage of existence between death and rebirth) enters into the mother‚Äôs womb while its parents are copulating. Seeing its future parents united, the spirit becomes deluded; if it feels passion for the father, it enters the womb to become a female, and if it feels passion for the mother, it will become a male. It also clings to the father‚Äôs ejaculated sperm and the mother‚Äôs ovum as its ‚Äúself.‚Äù But as we can deduce from embryology, this concept of self should not arise until the ovum is actually fertilized‚Äîthat is, at conception‚Äîwhich does not necessarily occur while the parents are copulating. And this account cannot explain how artificial insemination occurs. So this traditional view must be an explanation that was expedient under certain circumstances.

It follows then, if one wishes to use birth control, it should be done before the sperm fertilizes the ovum in order to avoid abortion, which constitutes killing. It may be moral if prior to sexual intercourse one takes anti-pregnancy pills or installs anti-pregnancy devices and/or medication inside the uterus or vagina. Such treatments will prevent the sperm from reaching the ovum or cause the sperm and eggs to lose their potency. But one must be absolutely sure that one is not killing the fertilized ovum. Otherwise, it‚Äôs best not to use birth control at all, and to instead use the method that Buddhism praises most highly‚Äîto practice sexual restraint.

Meditation and Ableism?,"I'm a very big advocate for disability and I have been practicing Buddhism in the Hu√°y√°n tradition for about three years now.

Recently I've been having second thoughts on meditation as a vessel of enlightenment. As disability studies informs us, not all minds are neurotypical, which is to say that all individuals experience phenomena differently. I have heard a few concerns from autistic individuals about the inability of certain neurologies to meditate (in the traditional practice) and it makes a lot of sense to me that the primacy on particular forms of meditation may be exclusionary of non-neurotypical individuals.

As someone who also believes strongly in Th√≠ch Nh·∫•t H·∫°nh's concept of engaged Buddhism, the coalescence of social justice and disability advocacy is crucial to the path of bodhisattva. This seems to come into direct conflict with the aforementioned primacy on meditation.

Is it possible for women to achieve anuttara-samyak-sambodhi?,"
TLDR: is it possible for women to achieve the same feat as Gautama Buddha, anuttara-samyak-sambodhi?

In the 12th chapter of the Lotus Sutra, Longn√º the dragon girl attains enlightenment, but only after first transforming into a man. I'm not sure if she attained anuttara-samyak-sambodhi or another form of enlightenment, but either way she did so in the form of a man.

Many nuns in the Pali Canon achieved enlightenment, but unless I'm mistaken they all became arahants, or ""sravakabuddhas,"" rather than samyaksambuddhas like the Buddha Gautama.

In modern times, the Kagyu nun Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo ""made a vow to attain enlightenment in the female form, no matter how many lifetimes it takes."" Assuming that the enlightenment she is referring to is anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, will it be possible for her to fulfill her vow?

I feel like a lot of people say ""all enlightenment is the same,"" which may be true but seems a little off-topic. The intention with this answer I think is to say there is no difference between a man achieving anuttara-samyak-sambodhi and a woman achieving sravakabodhi or pratyekabodhi, but my question is whether a woman can achieve anuttara-samyak-sambodhi like Gautama Buddha did? This answer might also be an oblique way of saying that in fact women cannot achieve anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, but that it's no big deal because the other two are just as good.

If the answer is no, why not?
If the answer is yes, who is a woman who has achieved it?",Buddhism,1701713281.0,t3_18aq4zg,0.53,1
How does advanced AI fit into Buddhist cosmology?,"Disclaimer that I don‚Äôt think any of this affects actual practice, but with all the AI news and seemingly inevitable advancements how do you think this meshes with Buddhist cosmology?

"Hindus and Buddhists view on each other's spirituality, and thoughts about Jesus","Hello,

I was wondering how Hindus and Buddhists (from all sects or denominations) view each other and each other's spirituality and religiosity. Your religions and world views amongst other Asian religions are somehow interconnected, and I'm really curious how they are viewed amongst you as followers.

I'm asking this since I'm taking a broad interest in Asian religions, and I am myself open to the thought of rebirth, karma and meditation. I spend a lot of time reading literature from gurus and about Buddha. I am learning how to meditate, albeit still at the beginning and it's taking time.

You might wonder what tradition I come from, and I come from an Eastern Christian tradition, and I regard and love Jesus Christ highly as an awakened person and a godly messenger. I guess he might be easy to revere from Buddhist and Hindu perspectives? I believe Christians with their religious practice have misunderstood him and his message. I find myself seeing him through new eyes. I would also like to hear common views about that.

Questions I didn‚Äôt get real answer about Buddhism,"Hello all. 
I tried asking these questions in various forums. But usually I was copped out. 
I hope someone who is not a blind fanatic can help me:
1) how far can you be kind? If you are kind to people that harm you or your kin, isn‚Äôt that not right action? On the other hand there was some ruthless killings in mynmar. Which I assume related to defending the Buddhist religion against annexation. 
Also, narcissistic people can take advantage of kind people. And not care or ‚Äúconvert‚Äù to be kind as well. 
I‚Äôm sure all of us had that kind of behaviour upon us, and it‚Äôs very challenging to me how to approach it, as I want to be kind, but I also know it won‚Äôt do him good. Or me. Like a spoiled child that needs educating. If you‚Äôll only care without borders you will get cruel behaviour from him/her. 

2) regarding reaching the highest state of non- rebirth. (The stage where you gained stream entry and you won‚Äôt be reborn again) 
That sounds to me, from what I‚Äôve read, and heard from
Various monks, practitioners is that the current existence isn‚Äôt the ultimate one. 
And here‚Äôs what puzzles me. If you actually reached a stage where nothing harms you mentally, what kind of suffering would you endure? Only physical. But you won‚Äôt suffer really. So what does it matter? Why do you think non rebirth is the best? 
It‚Äôs either nihilistic. Or there‚Äôs something I don‚Äôt understand. From what I know about life in my 48 years of experience, is that resilience is needed, and flexibility, to suffer less. And to absorb more and enjoy life by just existing. Which I found such a huge discovery when I start with Buddhism.",Buddhism,1683045434.0,t3_135t2sh,0.54,1

I'm interested in the more widespread Buddhist beliefs on abortion,"Hello friends, I am a secular Buddhist who has come to my own understanding of the intersection of Buddhism and the modern world. One thing that I am interested in discussing is the topic of abortion.

Tenzin Gyatso has said that he supports abortion in cases which birth would either kill the mother or result in a deformed/""retarded"" child. (I don't know the direct translation of his words, though I'm sure the word he used could mean either or both)

I personally disagree with his thoughts on the child, specifically in the act of denying someone existence solely because they would be born extremely neurodivergent or deformed. I understand what he means and I think that if the child will undoubtedly face a rate of suffering much more than normal that abortion would be considered sparing it then it could very much be used.

As well, I am of the belief that there should be measures taken to hopefully prevent women and trans men from undergoing abortions (such as financial aid, therapy, healthcare), but ultimately it should entirely be the choice of the pregnant person in question. In other words, I'm very strictly pro-choice as long as that choice is well-informed.

"""Dark"" Buddhism","**OP edit: dayum, considering this is a Buddhist forum there's some hardcore judgment and downvoting going on. Good job.**

Trying my hardest not to sound like an edgelord here.

So what I've noticed in my ""practice"" (not a normal morality-focused eightfold-path following one) is that there comes a point (years down the line) when the facts of unsatisfactoriness, Impermanence and no-self doctrines are so deeply ingrained in you and felt in your everyday life that psychologically it could be called depersonalisation.

I'm chasing pleasures of all kind (sex, drugs) and observe my desires being quenched and leaving me empty inside immediately afterwards.

I see constant change, flux and impermanence everywhere. This I think is the biggest truth of Buddhism. I realise how attachment to anything is ultimately futile and the only things I attach to are endeavours of pleasure, kinda going along for the ride (can be as innocent as being focused on a TV show until I binge it). Can't attach to people, wouldn't want to anyway, I see most people (and all other animals for that matter), as inherently selfish, temporary bundles of flesh and bone with a disgusting-looking organ in the driver seat.

Don't consider myself an exception in the least.
I also know that our personalities are made up of a constant flow of different emotions and thoughts, utterly meaningless.

Death is final and there is no reincarnation, just as there is no heaven with Jesus or Allah in it. I only believe what I observe and see about life as the Buddha intended.

Now this obviously does free me from a lot of suffering when I let go of attachments. It also, obviously, makes it extremely hard for me to connect with other people and even be emphatetic instead of utterly selfish.

Goodness is only a coping mechanism for inevitable death.,"I've been contemplating my own mortality and the meaninglessness of it all for the last few days. I have especially been curious about how Buddhism seems to avoid this issue and what differentiates it from Existential Nihilism.

Then I found this comment in a zen thread by a deleted account from a year ago:

""When you live for happiness, you fear death. When you live for goodness, you don't need to. Death is an enemy to happiness, but not really an enemy to goodness. I know that's vague but that's the direction I'd point you to, and is probably the extent of my wisdom on the topic!""

From [https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/82x9mb/zen\_and\_the\_fear\_of\_death/](https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/82x9mb/zen_and_the_fear_of_death/)

This brought me to two realizations:

\- living life for your own happiness, whether through pleasures, relationships or accomplishments, is ultimately unsustainable and brings only suffering

\- when you shift the focus from your own happiness to another person, a goal or even the worship of a god or an ideal (such as goodness), it is nothing but a psychological coping mechanism that allows you to reconcile your getting up in the morning with the futility of your impermanent existence.

The original zen/chan masters seem to disregard both theravada and mahayana Buddhism as lesser vehicles, in fact they throw out both good and evil as merely conceptual thought and for them, realizing the unborn Buddha mind equals killing the Buddha and ordinary mind being the Way.

With regards to modern times, a lot again don't know or care that the Dalai Lama has been in asylum in India since almost 1960. Not just asylum, the Tibetans have freely practiced Buddhism and the govt of India has given land for monasteries across India.

-Friend says something. I instantly answer in a reactive non-grounded way. There is a strong fear of rejection if I take long pauses instead of snapping out out of reactiveness. Also a desire to make people happy.

"Karma, Dharma, and Acts of Compassion 101","If you are interested in Buddhism, or any Eastern philosophy/religion for that matter, here are some basics you should know and/or teach.

Karma is a Sanskrit word, and just like any other Sanskrit word it has dozens of definitions. But one of the more practical ones is ‚Äúaction‚Äù. 

On a grander scale it refers to the cosmic law of cause and effect, action and re-action. Everything that occurs on any level in the universe percolates through the mysterious fabric of reality to create a change that must eventually resolve somehow to maintain equanimity. That‚Äôs nice to know and all, but for all intents and purposes it‚Äôs just theory. How does that apply to you personally? 

On a smaller and uniquely individual scale there are three basic types of karma to keep in mind. The first is a sort of ‚Äúprenatal‚Äù karma - this is what brought you to the precise time, place, and circumstances in which you were born on earth. The second is ‚Äúactive‚Äù karma - this is everything that is currently happening to you based on your actions since you were born. And the last type of karma is a little tricky - it is a sort of combination of the first two  and can be thought of as ‚Äúdestiny‚Äù karma, this is karma that will manifest at some point in the future. The trippy part of this one is that it can be altered based on your understanding and eventual manipulation of the law, which is where dharma comes into play.

Dharma, another Sanskrit word with dozens of meanings, essentially means ‚Äúduty‚Äù. Karma and dharma go hand in hand. It is because of karma you are here (again), and it is your duty to understand how to free yourself from subsequent misery-making incarnations. One of the most effective ways to do so is by realizing the true nature of the ‚ÄúSelf‚Äù by sincerely practicing a meditation technique similar to the one taught by Lord Gautama (pranayama and breath control are good places to start). Proper meditation will either help you ride the waves of karma with more ease as they come and eventually cease, or it will ‚Äúroast‚Äù the seeds of karma completely.

And once you master these principles, it is also nice to know the main types of compassionate, or ‚Äúliberating‚Äù, acts that will also help balance the karmic scales in your favor, until you reach the goal of caring about karma no more. In this world of ‚Äúsuffering‚Äù, having inner compassion for others is fine. Doing something about it is better. One can alleviate the suffering of another by three ways (in order of increasing utility) - material, mental, or spiritual. For example, you could give someone money, shelter, clothes, or food - this would help, but wealth such as this depletes. Or you might teach someone a physical skill or a mental tool to help him get along easier in this world. But, most importantly, you could also find ways to give someone lasting peace, such as teaching him how to meditate to the best of your ability or showing him where to learn. This is true spiritual wealth, and it is the kind of wealth that multiplies exponentially as it is passed on. 

The world can never have too much good karma, so let us continue creating it.",Buddhism,1496886228.0,t3_6fxxx4,0.5,0
Have I reached enlightenment?,"Six or so months ago, I was lying in bed on my own late at night. I usually think about various things late at night. Sometimes, I think about the nature of my existence. Other times, my thoughts are simpler and not very profound. I'm not really a Buddhist, but I can only guess this is what you people call meditation (is it just thinking for a long time?) Whenever I think about my existence it just puzzles me so much. I feel like in searching for an answer I am trying to solve a a complex differential equation in my head. It seems impossible as you barely even understand the question, let alone the answer. And the solution can never be exactly figured out; it can only be approximated.

But on that night my thoughts drifted in a totally unuiqe way, and I stumbled on a the thing that 'completed the loop' for me. It is an indescribable truth, and it was so defiant of my expectations, so simple, and so beautiful that I didn't find inner peice.

"I think certain drugs (dissociatives) have the potential to Enlighten or liberate you. I've seen the Supreme Self and the Absolute. I've seen the universe/Samsara from ""outside"". These experiences are just as valid as meditative ones. Right?","Different paths to the same place, I feel. 

Last night, I had an M-Hole that felt so spiritual and divine. I had an out of body experience, my ego was nowhere to be found. I was dissociated from my ""self"" and all that was left was pure consciousness and awareness.

Nirvana was perceived as a paradoxical truth about existence and non-existence. Existence is eternal and has always been here and will always be here. Things might go into and out of existence, but existence itself is always there. It makes you question, how is it that something has always been yet never came into being? You also wonder, instead of this reality we experience, why wasn't it just non-existence of all things forever? We know that has never been the case, because if reality never existed and there ""was"" nothingness for eternity... then we wouldn't even be here to question it.

The tricky and paradoxical part is that within existence, there can be non-existence. There can be non-experience. So in a way, even though there was always something here and it was never just eternal nothingness (which has never existed, can't exist by definition) the concept of nothingness has also always existed (within existence, paradoxically). 

The mind realizes that there was always a nothingness and  emptiness that it could attain. Liberation from itself.  It's difficult to express in language, that's why you get statements like ""neither perception nor non-perception."" It's possible for the Mind to detach from experience and be in a state that is neither experience nor non-experience. Nothing coming, nothing going.  

At least, that's how I see things at the moment... it's extremely difficult to express these understandings, words really don't do them justice.

MDMA and enlightenment,"This may just be downvoted into invisibility due to the general anti-drug sentiment in this sub-reddit, but I'll give it a shot.

-----------------------------

Does anyone else think that the MDMA/ecstasy experience is very close to nirvana? For those of us that have never done ecstasy before, let me clear something up: MDMA is *not* rolling around on the ground laughing, as it is portrayed in the media. The main effects are endless happiness, empathy, love, and peace.

When I take MDMA, I have unlimited feelings of peace and love towards all people. I don't act like an idiot like you've seen in movies. I feel as if something has been unlocked inside of me and it's finally spilling out like it always should. Sometimes I will just yell out things like, ""I love all of you! Peace to everyone! I now declare the world a happy place!"" This makes everyone around me happier too, even if they're not rolling.

I know a lot of you have negative reactions once people on here start talking about drugs. I don't think that the Buddha was experiencing an acid/mushroom trip for his whole life. I do feel like what he had was similar to what I experience when I take ecstasy. 

I'm not saying that we should all take ecstasy all the time instead of practicing. However, if you've always wondered what enlightenment is like and what you may be in for if you do awaken, you may want to try out MDMA or its siblings.",Buddhism,1342455259.0,t3_wndji,0.4,0

"Dharma Master Hengyun answers questions about abortion (3/3): ""Should a doctors perform abortions?""","**Question: My relative is an OB/GYN. If a pregnant woman has financial difficulties or already has too many children, is it okay for the doctor to perform the requested abortion?**

Answer:

...

A woman once brought her husband, an OB/GYN, to the temple. He had been diagnosed with cancer and hoped that the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas could help him. He told me that he took good care of his body and exercised everyday to maintain his health. Therefore he had no idea why he still got cancer. Actually, with abortions being so prevalent nowadays, OB/GYNs especially need to be careful. A doctor‚Äôs duty is to save lives, and performing abortions is contrary to this duty. Whatever causes we plant, we reap the corresponding effects. Karma results from our daily actions, while we create a cause only once in a while. Let me give you an example to illustrate these concepts. If we plant seeds in the spring, we need to wait until autumn for the harvests. 

The Brahma Net Sutra‚Äôs Bodhisattva precepts state that ‚ÄúA disciple of the Buddha must not kill by himself, tell others to kill, kill with expedient means, praise killing, or condone killing. He must not use any methods whatsoever, not even mantras, to kill. He must not create any causes for killing, effects of killing, methods of killing, and karma of killing. As long as the being has a life, he must not end its life intentionally.‚Äù ‚ÄúTo kill by oneself‚Äù means not only to take other‚Äôs life, but also to take one‚Äôs own life. ‚ÄúTelling others to kill‚Äù includes advising others to kill or sending someone to kill on your behalf. Whether the act of killing is done by your own hands or by others‚Äô hands because you told them to do so, the offense is the same.

...

During the 1980s, a manager came all the way from Southeast Asia to visit the Venerable Master at CTTB. This man had cancer and hoped the Venerable Master could save him. . .The Venerable Master further asked, ‚ÄúHow about your wife?‚Äù In surprise, the manager answered, ‚ÄúOh, I remember now. I once talked my wife into getting an abortion!‚Äù All the lives he had taken were coming to him and demanding payments. Therefore, if someone asks you whether she should get an abortion, you should advise her against it. Don‚Äôt say things such as, ‚ÄúIf you are in a difficult situation, just get rid of the fetus.‚Äù If you tell someone to get an abortion, it is considered as telling others to kill.

Upholding the precepts creates merit and virtue; breaking the precepts creates negative karma. However, causes and effects exist regardless of whether one has received the precepts. By killing a fetus, one will bear the consequences. I once saw rebirth plaques made by a mother who tried to cross over more than ten fetuses that she had aborted. It was frightening to realize how many lives she was indebted to! Our current ignorance creates a future full of ignorance, and a future full of ignorance causes us to be even more ignorant, thus creating a snowball effect.

I remember being an animal. How is this possible?,"I was a house cat. I still remember a few snippets of my previous life - I can remember the spot I liked to eat, a small glimpse of my owner, and the moment I died. When I became a human, I was close to my owner - I was able to verify that my memories were legitimate. Apparently, my cat self experienced kidney problems and had to be euthanized because I was no longer able to eat. I was even able to remember some fragments of the time in between lives, although some of it has no doubt been forgotten.

The reality of the world I found myself in has led me to ask a few questions about this experience.

1. Aside from a brief few seconds as a baby, my memory started to be continuous in roughly October 1999. Back then, I realized that I couldn't remember anything other than the day I was experiencing, the brief memory as a baby, parts of my cat life, and the time ""in-between"". According to my owner, my cat body was long dead before my human self was born. With this in mind, was my mindstream always inside my human body since birth, or did I possess someone?
2. How did some of my cat memory survive? If my cat body was dead before my human body was being formed, this must mean that the cat's ability to possess memory was dead too. How could it be, then, that I have those cat memories in my head?
3. Where are the other animal -> human individuals? Early on, I questioned others about their past lives, thinking it was common at first. When I realized it was not, I read stories about people remembering past lives as other humans, but there was never one about an animal life. Am I really that alone?
4. I read that habits can influence where you end up in the next life. I very much want to try and retain some memory of my current or past life for the next one. If I think about my strongest memories moments before death, is there a better chance that those memories will survive? I don't know if my cat self was actively trying to pass memories on - maybe I just got lucky that I could remember something.",Buddhism,1593073933.0,t3_hfik4b,0.64,17
The compassion and wisdom of the herb spirit Auspicious,"Hello r/Buddhism ! Since today is 4/20 (in the U.S at least), I think it would be valuable to show our appreciation and gratitude towards herbs. The following excerpt is from chapter 1 of the Avatamsaka Sutra (The Flower Ornament Scripture). This sutra is vast and the wisdom incredible. I pray this excerpt expresses the great compassion of the Mahayana sutras in liberating all types of sentient beings.
------

Furthermore, the herb spirit Auspicious found the door of liberation observing the mentalities of all sentient beings and striving to unify them. The herb spirit Sandalwood Forest found the door of liberation embracing all sentient beings with light and causing those who see it not to waste the experience. The herb spirit Pure Light found the door of liberation able to annihilate the afflictions of all sentient beings by pure techniques. The herb spirit Universal Renown found the door of liberation able to increase the boundless ocean of good roots by means of a great reputation. The herb spirit Radiant Pores found the door of liberation hurrying to all sites of illness with the banner of great compassion. The herb spirit Darkness Destroying Purifier found the door of liberation able to cure all blind sentient beings and cause their eye of wisdom to be clear. The herb spirit Roarer found the door of liberation able to expound the verbal teaching of the Buddha explaining the different meanings of all things. The herb spirit Banner of Light Outshing the Sun found the door of liberation able to be the advisor of all sentient beings, causing all who see to produce roots of goodness. The herb spirit Seeing in All Directions found the door of liberation of the mine of pure compassion able to make living beings give rise to faith and resolve by means of appropriate techniques. The herb spirit Everywhere Emanating Majestic Light found the door of liberation causing beings to remember the Buddha, thereby eliminating their sicknesses.

At that time the herb spirit Auspicious, imbued with power from the Buddha, looked over all the herb spirits and said,

*The Buddha‚Äôs knowledge is inconceivable‚Äì*
*He knows the minds of all sentient beings,*
*And by the power of various techniques*
*Destroys their delusions and infinite pains.*

*The Great Hero‚Äôs skills cannot be measured;*
*Nothing he does is ever in vain,*
*Unfailingly causing the suffering of beings to vanish:*
*Sandalwood Forest can understand this.*

*Observe the Buddha‚Äôs teachings like so:*
*He practiced for immeasurable eons*
*And has no attachment to anything:*
*This is the entry of Pure Light.*

*A Buddha is hard to meet, in a million ages;*
*If any can see one or hear one‚Äôs name,*
*It will unfailingly bring benefit:*
*This is the understanding of Universal Renown.*

*Each of the Buddha‚Äôs hair pores*
*Emits light annulling distress,*
*Causing worldly afflictions to end:*
*This is the entry of Radiant Pores.*

*All sentient beings are blinded by ignorance,*
*With an infinite variety of miseries from deluded acts‚Äì*
*Buddha clears it all away and opens the radiance of wisdom:*
*This Darkness Breaker can see.*

*One tone of the Buddha has no limiting measure‚Äì*
*It can open up the ocean of all teachings*
*So that all who hear can comprehend:*
*This is the liberation of Great Sound.*

*See how Buddha‚Äôs knowledge is inconceivable‚Äì*
*Appearing in all realms he saves beings there,*
*Able to make those who see follow his teaching:*
*This Outshining the Sun deeply understands.*

*Buddha‚Äôs ocean of compassionate means*
*Is produced to help the world,*
*Opening the right path wide to show beings:*
*This Seeing in All Directions can comprehend.*

*Buddha emits great light all around*
*Illumining all in the ten directions,*
*Causing virtue to grow as the Buddha‚Äôs remembered:*
*This is the liberation door of Majestic Light.*

------
If you read this far, I hope you found the excerpt enlightening. Now to conclude by dedicating merits:

May these profound merits and virtues
Be dedicated to all sentient beings
May we eliminate all karmic obstacles

"How Buddhism comes to Earth, how it disappears, and what you can do about it","For a while before the Buddha awakened, the Earth was devoid of Buddhism (dhamma vinaya). Without the knowledge of dhamma, beings are bound to perpetual, stressful existence. 

But then a Buddha arose, around 520 BCE, and set the wheel in motion. By giving his teachings, people lend ear, implement them, awaken to them, and teach others. This is how dhamma spreads throughout the world. 

For the sheer fact that we are on a Buddhism sub-reddit, we can give thanks to the Buddha for giving that first teaching to his four friends. From that teaching, that wheel has still been spinning. The teachings have continued to spread in all directions, and the unprecedented power of the world wide web has facilitated the teachings and their spread even greater. 

But as soon as the Buddhas body dies, the teachings start to erode and the wheel begins to slow down. This is because the Buddha is no longer around to verify the dhamma, so it is up to us and our sangha to preserve it. The dhamma, the Buddha said shortly before his death, should be our teacher and guide when he is gone. 

Many things can help facilitate the erosion of the dhammas existence on Earth. Off the top of my head they are:

    -a schism in the sangha
    -allowing women into the sangha (dhamma disappears 2x as quickly)
    -listening to other teachers and not the Tathagata

From these actions, the dhamma is pushed a bit further into disappearance from this Earth. 


So what can we do to maintain the dhamma. First of all, realizing that dhamma comes and goes as a natural cycle is healthy and rooted in right view. But that doesnt mean we cant do our part to help it be preserved and even continue to grow. The webadmin at ATI is one person I can think of who has helped spread dhamma. We do it everyday here, too. As long as its real dhamma.

Because of the scope of audience online, the disappearance or spread of dhamma can be manifold. Hopefully we contribute to the continued spread of dhamma. :)

Before the recluse Gautama, there were numerous Buddhas (28 in our aeon) who awakened and there will be numerous Buddhas in the future who awaken to the truth on their own. 

But right now, 2014, we are still experiencing and learning from the teachings in what we hope to be their preserved form. And this is why putting the teachings into practice is so important. This is how the dhamma becomes a living thing within everything. 

Try and facilitate the spread of true dhamma, and not its disappearance.

**The Buddha explains how Dhamma disappears from the Earth**

Staying at Savatthi. ""Monks, there once was a time when the Dasarahas had a large drum called 'Summoner.' Whenever Summoner was split, the Dasarahas inserted another peg in it, until the time came when Summoner's original wooden body had disappeared and only a conglomeration of pegs remained. 

""In the same way, in the course of the future there will be monks who won't listen when discourses that are words of the Tathagata ‚Äî deep, deep in their meaning, transcendent, connected with emptiness ‚Äî are being recited. They won't lend ear, won't set their hearts on knowing them, won't regard these teachings as worth grasping or mastering. But they will listen when discourses that are literary works ‚Äî the works of poets, elegant in sound, elegant in rhetoric, the work of outsiders, words of disciples ‚Äî are recited. They will lend ear and set their hearts on knowing them. They will regard these teachings as worth grasping & mastering.

""In this way the disappearance of the discourses that are words of the Tathagata ‚Äî deep, deep in their meaning, transcendent, connected with emptiness ‚Äî will come about.

""Thus you should train yourselves: 'We will listen when discourses that are words of the Tathagata ‚Äî deep, deep in their meaning, transcendent, connected with emptiness ‚Äî are being recited. We will lend ear, will set our hearts on knowing them, will regard these teachings as worth grasping & mastering.' That's how you should train yourselves.""

"How Aqua's song ""Barbie Girl"" relates to Buddhism (long)","Sometimes when I'm in the middle of some sort of process like driving or showering, I'll randomly start singing a piece of a song. I'll only sing a line or two, but inevitably, whatever I sang will prove itself to be a sort of signal for where my mind is at. It's like my subconscious wants to make a musical connection to whatever is going on. Today, I found myself singing a piece of the song ""Barbie Girl"" by Aqua. Which part?


""Imagination, life is your creation.""


It got me thinking about how the funny part of doing away with attachments and aversions, or living in the past or future, was that those things are all imaginary. It's like somewhere along the way I was told ""The imagination isn't for making friends unless you're a kid! If you're an adult, it's for reminding yourself of your past failings and future doom!"" hahaha. 


But the imagination is just the tool of the mind to create some something. Some concept, symbol, stuff like that. Essentially through my years of Buddhisting, I've learned the hardest lesson is simply making the mind a friend. At first, it felt like someone I didn't want to hang out with at all. Why would I? All it ever talked about was terrible things, and it looked down on everyone else for every reason it could muster unless they had something to offer me. What a jerk, right? That was my imagination. Now, I realize that imagination is just as much a part of me as anything else, and it deserves equal amounts of love and most importantly, space to grow. You can't just duct tape an annoying person's mouth, or run away from them or whathaveyou and expect that person to be any different the next time they make contact. You have to let them know that they are capable of infinitely different things, and that includes seeing the world in infinitely different ways. Sure, that friend might struggle, and the growing pains may feel hard to bare. But then, it's all imaginary anyways. 


I've learned that meditation can be a tool for me to run away, or a tool for me to explore and befriend. Either way, nothing is really happening. It's all in my imagination, but meditation helps me relax my imaginary concept of what kind of person I'm supposed to be, and with what mindset. The present moment is what I contrast that imagination with. The present is reality. My breath, my room, my bed, my a/c, my senses, my awareness of everything, that's the reality. 


If I take one more step back I can see that even that present moment is imaginary. It's all empty, and selfless. Nice work, 4 seals of Buddhism. And to contaminate that present with my imaginary b.s. attachment and aversions will never lead anywhere. That's like playing hide-and-go-seek with an imaginary friend and expecting to win in a real way of actually seeing them with my eyes, haha. 


So if my imagination creates all of this, and I can create whatever I want, what kind of world do I want to create?


Imagination. Life is your creation.

The Cult of Quotes,"People like to quote.

However, if you understand what you are talking about then you can put it in your own words using modern language and metaphors. This will communicate your point better than any old quote. Everybody knows this.

And if you don't understand what you are talking about then you are in no position to be picking quotes.

So why quote?

Because it's impressive. You get to borrow power from some old wise dude. You BECOME the old wise dude. 

It's like LARPing except without the inconvenience of buying a costume.

Give us a break. Don't quote.",Buddhism,1419354301.0,t3_2q6th4,0.48,0
The White Privilege of Zen Buddhism?,"If there is no concrete self to be found and if we, before a single though occurs are all essentially perfect and the same. If we are to put down opinions of good and bad, like and dislike to just perceive a situation clearly, treat all beings as our self.... Where does the white privilege of the Buddha dwell and where is the white privileged of east asian Zen masters?

I tried to give the simple advice to a family member distraught by thinking about race and thinking about the thinking they were having to put it all down and just look at what is before in every situation. I tried to say that we are all one race despite and that we should just moment by moment respond compassionately with a clear mind and that if we all can do that that is how we end racism and war. But I was just told that such a view was itself racist and was a product of my white privilege. 

If this practice and philosophy is extends back 2500 years to India and also over a thousand years to east Asia how can I be founded on white privilege and how can one show someone that they are just perpetuating suffering by clinging to ideas?
