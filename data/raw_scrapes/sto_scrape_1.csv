Looking for Seneca's quote on why even bed fleas have a purpose,"I think it was Seneca who wrote something along the lines of: even the fleas in our bed serve a purpose, for they prevent us from staying in bed too long.

My biggest life mistake was wanting to live an easy life,"2023 summons this the best, I didn’t want to exercise, diet, barely studied, barely did anything useful, expected my friend to do all the work for me, procrastinated a lot by saying that “tomorrow I start to do this”, got addicted to porn, tried to be a people pleaser (even going against some of my own believes), etc 

I regressed a lot as a person and what  were my rewards for wanting to live an easy life basically in autopilot with no logic and following just pure emotions ? Anxiety, memory issues, suicidal thoughts, weight gain, burnout, a lot of extra final exams that almost cost me a full semester, almost lost some of my friendships, i got way behind my peers and didn’t get my driver’s license 

Growing up I was never pushed/expected to do great things, if I was average that was enough for my parents and me, my mom basically did my homework for me, I would eat and watch tv all day and not leave the apartment and no one would care, so I never developed discipline, sense of urgency and maturity 

I have my ups and downs but basically to this day I lack those core elements and the 4 stoic principles 

With no temperance no self discipline nor control so I will waste my days with pleasurable things and just “do the important things tomorrow”, even tho nothing guarantees me a tomorrow

With no wisdom no intelligence and resourcefulness making me have bad grades at my college and be afraid to treat patients (I’m learning to be a dentist but I don’t reread core concepts such as anesthesia so I just ask my friend to do all the work for me at the clinic)

With no courage no scape from my comfort zone so I don’t try to improve myself 

With no justice I abandon my principles of wanting to be a good man and focus only on pleasing people and not strengthening or even developing a sense of character 

I hope that this serves me as an experience of what living a shallow existence is and how to always try to be better than yourself from yesterday (even if it takes baby steps)",Stoicism,1705691126.0,t3_19aqv6w,0.94,27

Does stoicism care anything about how simplistic or grand your goals are?,"I've been thinking a lot about meaning lately, and I guess I'm in somewhat of a crisis. 

I know a lot of people in the world might say that if you want meaning or purpose in your life you need a respectable goal. Which, on the surface, I can understand. 

My concern is that...what does it mean if you can't? What if you fail? We're all prone to do so. What if other obligations come along and you have to give up your dreams? What if you become disabled? What if you straight up die the very day you decide on a goal? 

I'm not saying that if someone is dreaming of being an astronaut they should just give up. But should our goals be where we find meaning and contentment? 

is there something, existing independent of our ability - or even desire - to self-actualize, from which we can draw value in our lives? ",Stoicism,1705689787.0,t3_19aqbnt,0.86,5
How does one stop being so emotional?,"
Hello,

A few months ago, I stumbled upon stoicism, and I've been thoroughly enjoying immersing myself in its teachings and practicing to become a true stoic, striving to be the best version of myself. However, I find that I'm facing a challenge in effectively harnessing my emotions. I comprehend that the teachings emphasize the practice of refraining from expressing unnecessary emotions, but I'm particularly struggling with becoming less emotional, especially in my interactions with other people. How can one navigate the path to emotional restraint and cultivate a more stoic approach, particularly in interpersonal relationships?

Even though I have researched and tried to apply my findings of stoicism, I feel that the one thing I still struggle to control is my emotional decision-making.

It’s easy to say to yourself “stop being emotional,” but I find it’s counterintuitive, especially if you encounter situations that will strike an intense emotion.

I appreciate your feedback.",Stoicism,1705688478.0,t3_19apsri,1.0,9

Today I will begin a path of gratitude,"4 years ago, coming out of high school. I experienced mental struggles that changed myself and the way I view life. For over a year, I struggled with severe depression and anxiety. While it did get a bit better, these mental issues underlied my time in college. They were related to regret, guilt, and insecurity.

4 years later in the present. I'm honestly in a position I never thought I'd be in. I've gained a lot of personal confidence, lost social anxiety, have a great girlfriend, and will be starting a job after college making more money than I could ever imagine.

But still, lately I've found myself more low than normal. Starting to spiral down into some of my old thoughts. Which are triggered by specific things that I won't get into. These past years, I don't think i've ever truly felt peaceful and free, at best I could push my thoughts away and try to ignore them. 

4 years of overthinking, dark thoughts, self-doubt, anxiety, closing myself off to others. What did I gain from that? Nothing at all. Just lost time.

Today I will try to being a path of gratitude and perspective. I cannot base my happiness on my current situation. I need to appreciate everyday as it is, not regretting the past or worrying about the future. I need to focus my energy into the things I can improve on and control, my work, the gym, building friendships, my relationships etc.

How do stoics react to an invitation for an argument?,"I was in the gym the other day, minding my business and focusing on my workout.

I'm putting myself down because of my thoughts,"







I'm so sick and tired of myself. I just don't understand why am I not taking actions in life to improve my life. It seems like I'm just living a meaningless life, where I can't find any enthusiasm optimistica. It's always ""sighs"" feeling whenever I even try to think of doing something. 
Often times I just feel like ""just do it"" but I'm making it so hard and complicated. Im repeating 2023 in 2024 and I feel this heavy burden like I just can't let this keep going anymore. Today my mom got mad on me reminding you're not doing anything with life but wasting critical time. You have whole life ahead and you already lost momentum and willingness to improve life. You already accepted failure and aren't doing anything to change. If I just keep going this way, then history will repeat year after year. I wanna get out of my head. I want to change my mindset. I have too and need too change. I told myself I want to start driving so I could become more independent. So I can go college in campus and find jobs that are far. I haven't even worked last year because I've been fed up working dead end jobs near my area. All I worked is fast food and retail jobs. I didn't even take classes for 2 semesters and this year, I even didn't sign up classes. I'm feeling so disgusted with myself like why am I living in misery and became loser.

What are some actionable steps to practice Stoicism?,"Recently I've been making a planned effort to study philosophy everyday, where previously I'd just passively consume information as my Youtube and Reddit algorithms put it in front of me. 

I've been primarily reading about Buddhism, and some Taoism as well. What I like about Buddhism, is that it is very clear about the steps you must go through in order to attain enlightenment. You must follow the Eightfold Path in order to attain enlightenment, and each step has very clear instructions. 

For example, Step 1 is to understand the Four Noble Truths, Step 2 is to internalize them and allow wholesome actions to naturally flow forth. Steps 3,4, and 5 precisely tell you what actions are wholesome or unwholesome and clear up any gray areas. Step 6 instructs you how to remove the 5 Hindrances (mindsets that hold you back from enlightenment), and cultivate the 7 factors of awakening (positive mental states). I haven't gotten to steps 7 and 8 in my studies yet, as step 6 is very dense with information. I'm getting this information via Ajahn Sona from this playlist of videos https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCXN1GlAupG0_DzIOFNrDSp0fTwTLkTxV&si=fiBpd9SM2c4m8XRA

I was wondering if Stoicism had similar actionable steps. I'm familiar with Memento Mori and the following quote from Meditations:

""[2.1] When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they cannot tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me.""

I was wondering if you know of any other actionable steps that can be taken in Stoicism, like there is in Buddhism. 

Also, from what I understand, Stoicism seems to be a reactionary philosophy. It seems to suggest waiting until something offends us, then rationally choosing a reaction during the time between stimulus and response. Buddhism seems to be more proactive however, allowing me to exert energy in order to remove the 5 hindrances, and giving me a task of cultivating healthy mental states via the process of meditation and mindfulness/metacognition. What do you think about this interpretation?

I made a very similar post in the /r/Taoism if you'd be inclined to see their responses. I enjoy learning about Buddhism, Taoism, and Stoicism; they seem to have a lot of overlap. The answers from that subreddit may potentially help you develop a deeper understanding of Stoicism if you're so inclined.",Stoicism,1705605483.0,t3_199y6r7,0.44,0
"'[...] Certainly it has made the inferior in the interests of the superior and has connected the superior one with another. You see how it has subordinated, co-ordinated, and allotted to each its due and brought the ruling creatures into agreement one with another.' Book 5, Paragraph 30, Meditations","
Adding:

'[...] For it has been proved long ago that we are born for fellowship; or was it not plain that the inferior creatures are in the interests of the superior, the superior of one another? But the animate are superior to the inanimate and the reasoning to the merely animate.' (Book 5, Paragraph 16, Meditations)

-----------------------------------------------------------

Hey, this quote(s) left a big questionmark on my mind, so I'm here for some input to understand them correctly. I conclude I've got more then one question to ask as they built up on each other.

(1) It translates to me that the old stoics distinguish between valuable and less valuable people.

(2) If my first impression (1) is right, why do high valuable people and superior only be the interest of likewise people and the inferiorjust existng just for the earlier mentioned? Why is the superior not helping the inferior to rise or at least show a new way of being and try to practice it? It seems that inferiors are only in the equation to look up to the rational ones (At first without judging it, just what it seems objektive. Later on it seems arrogant.).

I guess it's the distinguish between people who serve stoicism no matter what stage there on and the other people. A second or more detailed guess is that they distinguish between those who think, act and behave for the community/social mind and those who lay on them because they don't bring something valuable into it.
(3) Am I even close with my guesses?


From actually looking in our society we indeed have people who think, act, behave, yeah work and live for the society and e.g. others who can't or simply don't bring that much value into it and need to rely on others help, get cure or a financial minimum (at least to live) etc. We could see them as 'less valuable' because of the different input we all put in the big pot. Also thinking of disabiltys some people experience. But everybody is gifted individually and although I see those more- or less-'valuable' people in society, I wouldn't morality-wise treat them less respectful or think of them like less of a human being. Indeed it is humanly.

I slightly remember (might remember wrong) that Seneca said that as a stoic and aiming for getting wise you need to sort of break contact with those who aren't on the same path. Like choosing not to deal with them.

Please correct me if wrong or missing anything.)

"What would be the Stoic approach to dating and finding love? Is it even worth me, as a man, trying my hand at dating?","Long story short: I’m 28 years old and have never been on a date, and thus never been in a relationship. I’ve never known love outside of that given by my parents. And I also never had friends growing up and thus spent the majority of my life alone. That was until recently when I finally managed to acquire two genuine friends. 

To put it simply, I’m lonely. I feel an emptiness inside me that no amount of Lexapro (antidepressant medication) can seem to fix. I want the feeling of waking up next to someone I love and feeling genuinely happy. But I also know how hard it is for men in our day and age to find romance/love and how dating apps can be like bottomless pits of swiping over and over again, just hoping and praying one girl out of 100 will match with you. But even then, there’s a good chance she’ll ghost you just because. It all seems so hopeless. 

But, I also know the Stoics would say things like “Your happiness should not be dependent on the people in your life and the value you place on them”.

I need a stoic solution on how to deal with an issue in my relationship.,"Hi, my (F30) husband (M32) have different levels of affection whereby I am more affectionate and love spending quality time, hugs, kisses, asking about his day etc whereas this doesn't seem to occur to him naturally. Therefore I always feel deprived of affection and acknowledgement very often. It's as simple as not being acknowledged when I walk into the house after a workday, barely even looks in my direction and I have to initiate a Hi let alone a kiss. When I initiate he does respond but this is wearing on me since it would be nice to have that without asking for it. I have expressed this multiple times but he changes for awhile and goes back to old patterns soon after. I'm beginning to grow resentful especially because this last week and part of this week I have really struggled mentally and would have loved a genuine ""How was your day today?"". I would also love hearing ""I love you"" without having to say it first. So I decided to mirror his behaviour and not Initiate any of my usual affection and conversation, we've been quiet for 2 days. I wonder if I should focus on controlling my own actions as recommended by stoicism and maybe seek the affection elsewhere? Or maybe not give affection either so that I don't feel short changed and hence protect my peace of mind.

What’s the point,"Hey everyone. I got into stoicism about a year ago while I was having some family problems and the philosophy helped me get through those times. 

Because of Marcus Aurelius I started reflecting on my death a lot more. Originally this was helpful as it helped me put a lot of things into perspective. I realised how temporary my problems were.

However I’ve been thinking about death almost all the time for the past few weeks to the point where I don’t see the point in most things. I’m in college and used to be really focussed on my career and working out but now I feel like why should I bother being the best version of myself or strive towards being virtuous if it’s so temporary. Does it matter if I live according to my nature if I’m gonna be dead anyway? The advice I’ve gotten is to be good for the people around me but even their lives seem so temporary.

Practical advice to not dwell/feel guilt on past mistakes/regret,"When you make mistakes, big ones. Ones that might change the trajectory of your life. It's hard not to dwell on them.

It's very easy for me spiral into overthinking mistakes. Part of it is due to my perfectionist personality. The past few years for me have been rough to say the least. At times very low, but at times I felt happy and found joy in life.

Like I said, I often spiral into deep places of guilt at what I've done, anger at myself, anxiety towards the future, and so much regret that I just feel hopeless towards life. How can I help myself when this is happening.

Some things I try to tell myself.

\- Comparison is useless, I will always hurt myself looking for what I lack in others.

\- The only good a mistake can serve is a lesson, other than that it's just needless suffering

\- If my mistake does cost me now or in the future, than that is something I have to deal with, suffering in my mind is just extra punishment",Stoicism,1705552475.0,t3_199hmtv,0.86,15

"Hell, Camus, and the Ancient Stoics","I have a thought experiment and a question for y'all. 

**(The setup)**

Imagine that on the Day of Judgement, God, the Christian god, banishes the ancient Stoics to Hell. 

There are many Christian views on Hell, but let's suppose this Hell is an *inescapable*, *eternal* stream of *torment*. 

I know there are many Christians on this sub. Out of respect for their faith, let's not argue but simply suppose that the Ancient Stoics come to the conclusion that the Christian God is unjustful and thus not worthy of worship. Their claim is that an inescapable, eternal stream of torment is unjustifiable and inappropriate for punishment for whatever ""sins"" they committed in their finite lifetimes. If humans can forgive their persuctors, they reason, then surely the ""all loving"" Christian God can forgive. And if humans have the instinct to correct, rather than just punish, bad behavior , surely the ""all loving"" Christian God would eventual seize the torment so that people could reintegrate back into a relationship with God. 

**(The question)**

What attitude would the Ancient Stoics take in Hell? How would they handle themselves in Hell?

To be clear, this is just speculation. I speculate the Stoics would forgive the Christian God. I would imagine them like Camus said of Sisyphus:  *One must imagine Sisyphus happy*

And I would even imagine Epictutus whispering to himself:

> To incarceration. Do I have to complain about it? To exile. Is there anyone stopping me from going with a smile, joyful and content? ... **You'll shackle my leg, but not even Zeus can conquer my will.** 'I'll throw you in prison. My body. 'I'll cut off your head? Well, have you ever heard me suggest that I'm unique in having a non-detachable head?

So, what do you think? How would the Stoic handle themselves?",Stoicism,1705548648.0,t3_199gema,0.58,2

Example of daily Journaling,"Today at the grocery someone was backing out of a spot. I didn't see them until I was already behind them. I just kept driving because legally I had the right away. They laid on their horn. Now I didnt get mad and I didn't get worked up. I did get out of the car after parking knowing that they were about to drive past. I didn't want to seem like I was hiding or avoiding them as im trying to become more comfortable facing conflict, this is something ive struggled with my entire life. I also got out with a smile waved and started to say sorry. But the guy cut me off with some attitude ""boy you don't know how to drive do you"" (SO MEAN RIGHT?!🤣) here is were I lost sight. I got a annoyed and said something about how I was going to apologize but if he wants to be an ass we can be assholes. I could of just said. You know what man. Im sorry. In my defense me and my wife were talking about how she is currently having a miscarriage and I haven't really had a chance to grief and process the loss. So my emotions might of been a little off. 

In this situation there are a few things I could of done better. 1. Not let his comment annoy me into getting into a play ground argument. If he's not physically coming at me there is no reason to engage and 'save face'. Just apologize and move on with life.
2. I got a little bit of an adrenaline dump from arguing with him. This tells me I was looking into the future and the possibility of a fight from having words with him. If words are to be had then have them and be in that moment at that time and only get ready for a fight if a fight is about to happen. ""I have to die. If it is now, well then I'll die now. If it is later then now I will take my lunch"" 
3. After I walked away and into the store I was still worked up and it took some time to really come down and let go. I was still replaying the moment in my head. But not in a ""could I have done that better way"" in a ""I could of said this, that dude was such an asshole, I would of kicked that dudes ass"" way.  In this moment I was ""suffering more in my mind then in reality""

Stoicism is incredible !,"Hey friends, I didn't imagine that a philosophy could impact me so much in such a short amount of time. It's just incredible.

I discovered Stoicism recently, and to be honest, I didn't believe much in the effect. Out of curiosity, I started delving deeper, and just wow, it resonated so much with me and really improved my mind. I found peace with myself. The idea that life is about balance; I found that controlling your actions is not achieved by fighting your emotions, but by accepting your emotions at their fullest and letting them express inside you. Little by little, I began to feel a kind of moment where you face your mind, and you see your feelings taking over. With time, I feel more and more able to see clearer and take better decisions and I'll be happy to learn more.

"I do not recommend ""How to be a Stoic"" by Massimo Pigliucci","When I started this book, I expected a philosophical manual on Stoicism, at the end of a most underwhelming read however, what was delivered was a poorly written and thinly disguised self-help book.

&#x200B;

It started out decently enough though, a brief history of the philosophy, followed by an examination of its main tenets. All the good in it was contained in the first 20% and even then there were traces of the navel-gazing to come. Everything after... shockingly poor.

&#x200B;

Never have I seen an author miss the mark so much. The decision to write this in first-person only served to show how flawed the author is, all of his biases and prejudices were laid bare. A better title for this book should have been ""How to be Massimo Pigliucci"", every chapter was littered with entirely boring and braggadocios anecdotes of a man who evidently thinks himself an embodiment of humility, modesty and fine character. You would see interesting chapter titles that ended up being neither informative or thought-provoking, for someone who never missed the opportunity to tell the reader how non-religious he is, the whole book had an air of boring preachiness about it.

Scary lawyer letter,"Everyone probably heard about these letters, knows someone who received them, or received them themselves. Lawyers keep sending these letters because they are effective. People get scared and pay even if they have no obligation. For example, in some countries, media companies hire lawyers to send these letters to people who pirate movies, demanding payment to avoid a lawsuit.

From a Stoic perspective, these letters are ink on paper - nothing more. It's up to you to decide what you think and what you do. If you feel anxious, the letter is not causing it. It's your brain that is taking the bait. 

I never cared about these letters, but it's always a few days of drama when a household member picks them up from a mailbox. Since they don't understand the law, they already imagine someone coming to our house and taking possession of our household items because of ""debt"" or me ending up in jail for years.

Don't suffer imagined troubles. Seneca said, ""we suffer more in imagination than in reality.""

How to deal with Anger and Discomfort during banter among friends.,"I have this group of friends that I hang out with sometimes. Where, I don't feel like I am being myself when I am with them. Sometimes they throw banter at me and laugh. I initially took it lightly. But when they repeatedly use the same joke (which is not even funny tbh), I get irritated and angry. I don't show it but I feel like my ego is getting shattered. I usually want to create an impression about myself where I want to be treated with respect. I respect others too. But, here I feel like that impression is getting shattered when my legs are being pulled.

I have other friends too. With whom I am very comfortable. I speak my heart out when I am with them, unlike the friend group I talked about above, where I would always be on my toes and want the conversation to end.

How to turn an obstacle into an opportunity?,"I am struggling to find the opportunity in the obstacle. This is where I call upon your help. Please be gentle, I am a sad raccoon 🦝

Three years ago, I lost my job caring for a sick previously estranged family member (dementia and alcoholism-based physical complications). I had no support from anyone so I fell into debt paying bills and rent and groceries. One family member stepped in, making all sorts of  allegations and being outright abusive in a bid to get total control of my dad's finances. I was proven innocent again and again, but nonetheless it all took a terrible mental toll and I eventually had to step back for my own health.  The whole situation lasted around three years and every moment was awful. I managed to find another job within a few months of losing my last, which I dislike and pays badly.

I'm trying to move past it all but with the debt at £12,000 (I pay it down and it just gets bigger every year at 47% interest) I'm finding it hard. I've been job hunting for a better salary to outpace the interest as I'm currently underpaid where I am but I've had terrible luck. 

I was offered one job after around seven interviews, for example, then the offer was rescinded because the company decided to freeze all hiring. Situations like this have happened repeatedly, where I'm unsure how my actions could have created a better outcome and I'm doing everything ""right"" on the surface. I have given up on job hunting for now and am trying to accept and be grateful for the job I do have.

This has increased the sense of desperation, as the job I lost caring for my father was awesome and paid well, and I feel like I'm not going to be able to get back to that again. This increases my resentment towards the situation, like it's a reminder how many steps back it's pushed me.  

I am also very physically unwell, recovering from three years worth of burnout, but I cannot take any significant amount of time off because my company does not pay sick pay. In fact, they threatened to fire me if I took more than a fortnight off. I exercise a lot, take medication and eat healthily but am so very, very weary and generally sad all the time. 

I am also unable to get the medication that would help my newly diagnosed disability, which apparently compounded the stress of caring for my dad, due to a long waiting list in my country's healthcare system. 

I think about all I did caring for my dad, all the things I fixed for him, like chasing down scammers to get back money and using that to organise his care, and how it helped him and the family member that savagely betrayed me but just set me back so far. 

What opportunity can I find in this adversity? 

I regret doing it. My dad abandoned me as a child and it was foolish of me to help him.  My friends say I should be proud of helping him when he was so terrible to me but I don't really see what the virtue in that is. I mostly feel stupid. I'm struggling to see what I can learn from this or how it has been anything other than a a series of cruel circumstances drawn yet again from having an abusive, screwed up family. Other than, maybe, I should have just left him to die. But that doesn't feel right at all. But perhaps it is? Perhaps that is the opportunity? Or is just plain acceptance the way forward? 

So please, help me find the silver lining, the opportunity in the obstacle, so to speak. I feel that if I can extract meaning from it I can move in. It's been a year since I stepped back from the majority of my duties, and I still cause myself suffering over it all the time. 

I'd like to cultivate peace and moving on from it rather than the daily resentment, grief, self-hatred and desperation. I know some of this is my C-PTSD and how it all triggered a lot of trauma, but a lot, honestly, feels spiritual and mental, like I can't make my world right after it.

I've been practising Stoicism alongside general philosophy and meditation for awhile. I also go to weekly therapy and exercise for up to two hours daily for fitness and anger processing.

SouthAsian Narc mother causing me issues that directly impact my life and beyond my control. How to proceed?,"My SouthAsian narc mother is making my life hell from far away in another country. She is the kind who will go to extreme lengths that directly impacts your life (e.g. calling up your workplace and generally ruining your work life) that you have very little control over OR you need to mitigate or defuse it afterwards but the damage has already been done.

Problem: Now she is spreading rumours about me and my partner about me being abused by him. Solution - we can ignore it as it does not impact my life directly. 

Problem: She is calling me every moment, bombarding me with messages which is literally causing me to physically hyperventilate and increased blood pressure. Solution - i can block them on phone after writing a short message not to call me so that they don't think I am dead.  

Problem: She may come to my place unannounced and me being unprepared. Now this does directly impact me. I do not know how to deal with this if she suddenly appears at my door. Solution? - I take her to an airbnb or dump her with my potential mother in law so she can diffuse the tension for me. This is just one idea.

An Unorthodox Method To Deal With Anxiety,"In this post, I will present what I consider to be an unorthodox method of dealing with anxiety and what I will dare to call, anxious thinking. 

**Cause**

It is possible that, at this moment, you are going through a particularly tense, difficult, or painful situation in your life and think that your anxiety is the direct, natural consequence of events in your social, family, or work environment.

However, the cause of your anxiety is not found in what you are currently experiencing; instead, it lies in the future that you believe you will have to face. Your mind is filled with repetitive thoughts about imaginary scenarios in which that catastrophic future will occur.

What causes your anxiety is not a specific situation you are experiencing but the imagination of something much worse, which your mind categorically classifies as unbearable.

**The Method**

How to deal, then, with anxious thinking? How to overcome chaotic, repetitive thoughts in an imaginary scenario that torments us? The method I propose is to imagine the worst, to think about the scenario that torments you.

I dare to classify this method as unorthodox because it goes against what we intuitively would like to do to avoid anxiety: avoid thinking about what we fear. However, analogues of this method can be found even in various ancient philosophies, among which Stoicism is no exception.

The idea is to observe the same imaginary scenarios that generate anxiety, but really analyze them, view them as another possible option calmly, rather than as an event that will inevitably occur in a way that is categorically incompatible with our existence. The reason these thoughts obsessively cause us anxiety is that our mind unquestionably classifies them as unbearable.

Likewise, just thinking about them calmly is a very powerful weapon to drive away anxiety. We must remember that, evolutionarily, the goal of these repetitive thoughts is to prepare us for plausible future scenarios and obtain useful intuitions about how to act in response to them.

However, individuals experiencing anxious thinking are unable to use imagination as a source of knowledge, only as a source of fear. When possible worrying scenarios appear in their minds, the anxious individual gets stuck in them, going round and round through chaotic, repetitive thoughts.

But if, following the original evolutionary objective of these thoughts, we delve into the imagination of possible solutions, our thoughts will not generate the same anxiety. By doing this, we put ourselves in a situation where we internalize them as past events that have already occurred.

Seeing them through this key is much simpler because it is not difficult to face a past situation, which, like any other, is just a fact against which we will have to act.",Stoicism,1705424826.0,t3_1987x3d,0.91,9
Dr. Michael Sugrue has died.,"According to his official YouTube channel, Dr. Michael Sugrue has died.

How do I have more patience with my mother ?,"I’m sorry to use internet terms but, she’s a Karen, There’s no better way to tell it

She’s always talking loudly, complaining about everything, treating her own mom like garbage, always fat shaming me, she doesn’t accept that I’m bisexual (I had to break up with a great guy because of her), she’s a hypocrite, an alcoholic, she doesn’t listen to my arguments, she never listens to me, she makes it super clear that she wanted another son who would follow everything that she wants, everything needs to be her way, she doesn’t respect my boundaries and limitations, is always calling me weird even tho my psychiatrist told to her face that’s likely that I’m on the autistic spectrum, she’s always hammering in that I didn’t get my driver’s license after failing the exam for the first time, she doesn’t want to pay for my medications, she forced me to go to a college that I don’t like (she literally matriculated me there without my consent), she’s always doing things behind my back and telling me moments prior until the event happens, making me super anxious, she thinks that I’m faking being depressed and anxious….

Next year I’m graduating from college and I will be able to live my own life but I still need to get through this year 

I really didn’t want to feel this way about her, none of my friends have issues with their parents, and I do t like to hold grudges against anyone, not even those who hurt me, Marco Aurelius told that people are meant to cooperate with one another and that hate and rivalry are unnatural but I’m tired of trying to change her",Stoicism,1705417677.0,t3_19850pr,0.5,0

On top of that, it had been a personally rough year for me and my family. Needless to say, I was nervous. 

I had no reason to be. His review overall was very positive. I learned a lot about his point of view on the friction we’ve had and took away some pointers. I don’t agree with all of his feedback, but I can’t deny that it was fairly delivered with adequate detail.

I’ve unsubscribed from every porn related subreddit and deleted my safari history so whenever I google something it will not appear but it did not work for too long either

The same with my YouTube I try to distract myself with other things such as books and movies just to have a better sense of time expended per entertainment, I can finish 1-2 chapters or watch a movie in 1-2 hours each and have the rest of my day off instead of watching multiple videos of 50 minutes a day

I can't go on with my life like this.,"Hey.

​

Hemorrhoids have sucked the joy out of my life for the last 2 years.

I'm sitting at home, crying because I just see no light at the end of the tunnel.

I'm a very upbeat person. Always trying to see the positive. But I feel so helpless here.

​

I'm a 31 year old, (otherwise) fit male.

​

Every day I find myself anxious or uncomfortable about the most mundane things.

Sitting on the subway. Driving a car. Walking. I lost my ability to relax.

​

I constantly feel my hems and they get worse during the day. Every evening I wish

my life was different. I envy every person that doesn't have to deal with this.

I love to do a lot of sports. Now I'm too scared to do hard exercise.

I don't do any activity that could lead to worse Hemis (bouldern, skiing, running, lifting). I love to do all of those things.

​

I do everything in the book that should help or prevent them.

Eat a lot of fiber, drink enough water, NEVER EVER STRAIN. Nothing helps.

​

My therapy so far:

​

Got hemorrhoids in early 2021. Got first banding in August 2021.

Got another banding. Got sclerotherapy. Got Raphaelo radiofrequency treatment.

Tried alternative healing as well (TCM etc.)

​

They were Grade 2. Now grade one, but there is still CONSTANT pressure on my fucking anus.

​

I also hate thinking about them so much. But I can't help it. It's almost an intrusive thought at this point to think about them. Even they are ""only"" grade 1 atm I can feel them every day, all the time.

​

Sometimes I have the thought, that my intrusive thinking about them makes them worse or that they would go away with me doing it. But it's impossible not to think about them. And they are connected to so much anxiety and shame. It's such a downward spiral thought process as well.

​

I want to know if I can get rid of them again in my life. But all the posts about surgery also seem horrible. And I'm not sure you could do that for grade 1-2 hemorrhoids.

I don't want to lose hope that my body can regain balance.

​

I just wanted to post it here because I had to get it out of my head.....

​

Thank you for reading.

"Kahneman and Klein (2009) stated, “a psychology of judgment and decision making that ignores intuitive skill is seriously blinkered” (p. 525).","As far as I know, Stoicism advises people to avoid making decisions or judgments by relying on their intuition or first impression. What do you guys think about the studies done on decision-making, that is on system 1 and system 2 thinking. These studies say that they both have a place in making optimal decisions. I am not talking about our brain's ability to compute the speed and angle of a ball that we can catch with the right timing. I am talking about decisions to let's say let our anger out in a situation to set some boundaries or protect ourselves without rationalising it before doing so.

How I discovered Stoicism. How did you guys discover Stoicism?,"Technically there are a wide range of things that lead to my discovery and pursuit of Stoicism, but the main two reasons were: Breakup and David Goggins. Before I continue, **I know that David Goggins is not a Stoic.**

I read both of his books: “*Can’t Hurt Me*” and “*Never Finished*”, and it was extremely inspiring. He has been through *so much* hardship in his life that if he were to just completely fail in his life, no one would blame him. They’d excuse it under the premise that because of all the hardship he’s been through, it’s expected for him to fail. Instead of allowing the hardship to ruin the rest of his life, he used it as fuel and became a Navy Seal, an ultra-marathon runner, completed a bunch of Iron-mans, and a fucking author despite his severe learning disability. I’ve also been through much hardship; abuse (physical and sexual), homelessness, and a lot more which I will not list because…honestly it just feels odd listing it all. From his books, I learned a key lesson: It’s not what happens to you that matters, but who you are despite everything that matters.

Fast forward to the breakup, I got cheated on, discovered it was going on for a while yadda yadda. I was angry, felt humiliated, sad, hurt, but from what I learned, I decided that I can either let this break me, or I can use this situation as a challenge to maintain my character and not allow this situation to destroy me. So, I took on the challenge. Instead of acting out of anger, I had a conversation with them in order to gain understanding, I forgave them (after ending the relationship of course), and treated them with as much respect and kindness as I would to anyone else despite what they did to me, with no desire to receive any of that back. Day after day of doing this, I found myself feeling extremely happy and honestly excited. I was like “You’re telling me that a 5 year relationship just ended from cheating, and I can be THIS GOOD? Even after everything that happened?” Yes, those were sad times, but the fact that I maintained and even improved my character despite that is something that will stick with me forever. 

So, I decided to continue with the momentum by learning even more. I thought if this is something I was able to learn on my own, I can only imagine what I can learn from others. So I looked up “Books every man should read” on reddit, and found meditations. Then through meditations, I decided to join the Stoicism subreddit where I then found Epictetus’s Discourses, and the rest is history.",Stoicism,1705375683.0,t3_197sqog,0.86,5

Irony in morning meditation," Recently,  I stumbled upon stoicism by reading a couple books. I've struggled through much of my life looking for philosophy that matches what I believe. Stoicism feels like something I can really get behind. From my perspective there are a lot of truths to it. So I'm pretty excited to be apart of it and the community.

The reason I'm writing this post is to share my new experience. While reading has been a pleasure, I'm finding the actual practice difficult. Today was a perfect example. I spent so much time angry at every little life nuisance. While walking my dogs I was angry about the traffic and other people trying to use the sidewalk. I was acting surly. I've used Marcus Aurelious 's morning meditation to help deal with co workers and other people who stress me out. Yet I turn around and act the same way they do. In a sense it's kind of funny. Like going from hero to villain. What a fucking hypocrite.

**Resources**

We plan on following an average reading list for an undegraduate course in philosophy. We started with ""Think"" by Simon Blackburn, an introductory book into philosophy. If you don't have the resources, I will provide them.

**Schedule**

We meet once a week, on Sunday at 18 GMT. During these meetings we review and discuss our readings. Discussion questions on the topics at hand are be prepared beforehand, I usually use both human and AI inputs to write discussion questions but feel free to contribute in whatever way you want.

**Requisites**

* Passion. The books we are going to read are not exactly fun read if you don't like the subject matter. I've noticed that a significant amount of people get demoralized when they approach the text as they turn out differntly from they expected.
* Consistency. I plan on reading thirty-five to fifty pages a week (five to seven pages a day). It's not a huge time commitment but it is still a time commitment.
* I don't really care about age but I prefer people over 18 for this club.
* Discord, we use this platform.",Stoicism,1705345159.0,t3_197go4c,0.75,4

Brother is obsessed with Andrew Tate,"My brother, a 17 year old, lives by Andrew Tate’s “philosophy” as if it were the law. 

I didn’t know anything about him until I started to get into the root cause of my brother’s behavior. 

It’s a complete bastardization of stoicism. Just unbelievable how selfish his behavior has become. 

He shows no respect for our father, who is elderly now. No respect for anyone other than himself. I’m not going to go into details because it’s a long list. 

After briefly reviewing some of the Tate “ideologies,” I’ve come to realize justice is an afterthought. 

Yes, I know. He’s a 17 year old boy. 17 year olds are selfish. I was at one point. However, it seems out of control now and I don’t know how to mentor him properly. 

I’m 33. He’s my half brother. Father is a single parent with 3 other half brothers to look out for. Very clear he received minimal discipline. 

I try my best to mentor the boys because my father needs the help. 

I’ve been away in the army for the better part of the 17 year olds life. I’m not worried, I don’t fear the outcome. I know it’s his choice. However, while he’s still in the house, I would like to make an impact because it’s very apparent that it will cause him hardship when he’s moved out. 

This kid is the “cock of the walk.”

Here’s a brief description. 

17 years old, 6’4”, 250 lbs, all state football, Jock, Smart. He proclaims he’s the Alpha of the school. I cringe just typing that sentence. 

Any advice welcome.




Edit: I see why people would construe my words as jealousy. I said I wasn’t going to go into the details because it’s a long list, here’s a recent example. 

Last month he stole one of my father’s credit cards and spent $3500 in 20 days before we saw the statement. He was going out and taking friends to nice dinners, Uber eats to school for lunch, bought a membership to a health club, buying clothes he didn’t need…

When confronted by my Father, he showed no remorse by saying he simply “needed money.” The only thing I’ve said to him was, “I’m disappointed in your actions.” He avoids me like the plague now.

As for the reason I bring up his physical attributes. My father is elderly. He can barely walk. He simply cannot discipline him due to my brothers size and mentality. It literally becomes a shoving match with my father ending up on the floor. It’s just a bad situation.",Stoicism,1705339910.0,t3_197efd1,0.9,467
Stoic advice on street fights,"24 M. Was physically assaulted by club staff (14 v/s 3 of us) 2 years ago. That has given me a great deal of PTSD.

I know the usual advice is to avoid physical fights. But if you’re having a confrontation with someone and they punch you first, what to do then? What if someone teases my sister or gf? What if they are being unnecessarily physically aggressive?

In such cases do I get away and call the authorities or fight?? It’s somewhat of a pride thing too. Running way from such situations feels weak and hurts my pride. 

Thinking about all this has given me great social anxiety. 

And yes, I am not afraid of getting beaten up. I don’t feel anxious in confrontations with known people. It’s only with strangers because there’s fear of death.

Meditations 5.5 for me is the definition of stoicism in a nutshell.,"“Thou sayest, Men cannot admire the sharpness of thy wits—Be it so: but there are many other things of which thou canst not say, I am not formed for them by nature. Show those qualities then which are altogether in thy power, sincerity, gravity, endurance of labour, aversion to pleasure, contentment with thy portion and with few things, benevolence, frankness, no love of superfluity, freedom from trifling, magnanimity. Dost thou not see how many qualities thou art immediately able to exhibit, in which there is no excuse of natural incapacity and unfitness, and yet thou still remainest voluntarily below the mark? or art thou compelled through being defectively furnished by nature to murmur, and to be stingy, and to flatter, and to find fault with thy poor body, and to try to please men, and to make great display, and to be so restless in thy mind? No by the gods: but thou mightest have been delivered from these things long ago. Only if in truth thou canst be charged with being rather slow and dull of comprehension, thou must exert thyself about this also, not neglecting it nor yet taking pleasure in thy dulness.”


It says that if we don’t have s desirable trait by nature alone that it’s in our power to gain it by dedication 

I want to be a kind and smart man, I’m kind by nature but not very smart (it’s obvious that a lot of factors come into play that Marcus Aurelius couldn’t have understood back then, such as in my case where I’m a neurodivergent person but that doesn’t mean that I can’t strive to learn more with a combination of meditation, therapy and discipline of study) 

The quote emphasises subjects of dedication, control of pleasure, acceptance of one’s luck (or the idea of fortuna), benevolence, etc 

It teaches us to not blame external factors and that the talent can be surpassed if the dedication overcomes the talent, as someone who have always compared myself with my peers and always thought that (i’m slow and there’s nothing that I can do to change it) this quote hit me like a brick to the head",Stoicism,1705261004.0,t3_196o3kq,0.89,13

My Mum has cancer.,"In December, Mum was diagnosed with a cyst. It was cancerous and thankfully, they said it was localised. Recently, she had her operation to remove it. They found that the cancer was worse than they anticipated and it was spreading and that chemo is needed. They are hopeful we will win.

I prepared myself mentally. I meditate every day, I felt the emotions, I reflected on the situation, tried to accept that there is a possibilty that mum could die. I gave my very best to my mum in terms of emotional support and care. I am her shield in life (domestic abuse) and emotionally she relies on me. I promised her that the only thing I can offer is my undying and committed support to her and that we will fight to the end.

Today I went to see her for the first time after the operation. Mentally I thought I was prepared. Nothing could have ever prepared me to see my beloved mother in pain, barely speaking and full of pipes and wires. It hit and cut deep on a very emotional level.

I started to cry silently. No one wants to see their mother like this. Somehow the Stoic training kicked in. I felt myself thinking: I am a human being, it is ok to cry in a situation like this and I am feeling my emotions. It is ok. Emotions must be expressed. This is not within my control and I am operating well in the things I can control, that is my mind and actions. 

I stayed there till visiting hours were over, made sure she was comfortable, and left.

As much as I like reading and learning Stoicism, I think the biggest teacher of Stoicism is life. This terrible situation is totally out of my control, rest for my little personal actions. We have a long road ahead, but I believe with a good mindset, I will be able to navigate the stormy seas that are ahead while supporting mother.

I am sorry if this may sound like humble brag. It is just me expressing my emotions on the Stoic subreddit, where experiences like these remind me how much I still have to learn.",Stoicism,1705242563.0,t3_196h2vx,0.97,183

I made it clear, that if she should what I would call a 'negative result' then I would do everything in my power to keep our relationship the same: friends. (Because I truly respect this woman.)I want her to feel guilt free and, if possible flattered by my affection. This I achieved - I believe. But now, I have confessed, and unfortunately said negative result has arrived I need help on thworting how I pine for her, at least physically.

I got an idea of the basic stoic theory and practises, but I find it quite difficult to get it ""under my skin"". 

Is there a boot camp or other similar venue somewhere in the world where students of stoicism for 1-2 weeks meet to discus the practical matters and live stoicly under the guidance of a competent instructor? Not unlike how things went about at the stoa poikile in Athens.

I saw a post here a short while ago about how Marcus Aurelius fed people to animals, and what that says about the credibility of his Meditations.  I don't know what the exact context was of my post title when he wrote it, but as I reflect on it, I am taking everything I have written here into consideration. 

Also, I try to praise loudly and criticize quietly, but I Still critize, blame people when I don't get what i want from them, especially if they've been reliable in the past. It's the inconsistency of people that gets to me alittle, because even though I am not perfect in my interactions with people, I prioritize being consistent(although it's out of my hands how people perceive my consistency.) So whenever i catch myself mentally blaming someone, I lean into it, but I ""level"" myself by adding to that mentally placating the person, or adding to that the mental equivalent of being physiologically distracted. Non of these is exactly in Stoicism(because non of those involves being super logical), but they are in a form of therapy I've found useful. And yes, I do know how important being logical about everything is, how useful logic is, and how indispensable it is to the life I am trying to live.

Anyway, I always had this desire to find something that would make me do something for the world, not caring about fame or anything like that, but just to know that I contributed a little to the future of humanity, something like Newton's contributions to Physics, a subject that I have always loved. A little because of this, I decided to start a physics course at university, with the childhood dream that it would be easy to achieve something of this magnitude, but then I was faced with the fact that maybe I didn't like physics that much to dedicate myself to it. an entire life. I mean, the more time passes, the more I realize that I'm not an academic. I love physics, but I also love many other things that take up my time and that I consider just as important. It's as if the side of me that wants to do something for the world conflicts with the side of me that just seeks my happiness. On the one hand, I fear spending my whole life searching in vain, and in the end realizing that I wasted my chances of enjoying everything I could. And on the other side, I fear reaching the end of my life, taking advantage of every opportunity to be happy, but having to carry the burden of feeling like I haven't achieved anything, of not having left anything useful behind, as if my existence as a human asked me to do something. Currently the answer I have to this dilemma is that, no one who really changed the world had the objective of 'changing the world', they had an insatiable passion for something, and leaving a legacy of that was just a consequence of that passion. It's like an eternal doubt, I want to fulfill a duty and not be selfish, at the same time that I can't say there is something, a passion, that makes me focus on it that much, because I love many things.

Forgive me for this huge text hehe. I know I'm still young and immature, so forgive me too if I wrote something clearly absurd (Also if this has nothing to do with stoicism, I'm still new), but that's how I feel. These existential questions have always plagued me, but I like to think, I like to think about them and any work that delves into this type of thing. A work that I can use to draw a parallel about how I feel is the work of fiction and fantasy Fate Stay Night, more specifically the character Emiya Shirou. In short, and spoilers ahead, the game has 3 routes in which Shirou makes different decisions. In one of them, he decides to become a hero of justice, even though he knows all the bitterness that this path would bring, and the story really deals with that, it is a complete break with that hero stereotype, but Shirou still chooses to be, which I think it's very pretty. In another route, however, he decides to be the hero of just one person, Sakura, the girl he loves. In one route he decides to embrace his childish ideals in the name of a greater good, and in another he decides to embrace his own happiness. In both cases he decides to embrace this passion, and I feel exactly in the middle of it, remembering that it is just a parallel. Trying to be a 'normal' person or trying to be something more. I see possible regrets in both of them. I know there's no right answer, but I think I wanted to vent a little about this, and I wanted to know if you guys had any thoughts on this. It's something that scares me a little hehe, but I like to think about it",Stoicism,1705115413.0,t3_195dz3r,0.43,0
How Do I transcend My Own Suffering?,"I recently started reading a psychiatry book, titled The Haunted Self, which is primarily focus on trauma diagnosis and recovery. I learned that trauma can shatter your very essence in a proportional amount to the severity and frequency of the trauma. Don't get me wrong I understand that suffering is a fact of life, and therefore, cannot be avoided. Additionally, suffering can teach us valuable lessons and propel us forward if harnessed and put to good use. Nevertheless, I still can't wrap my head around the fact that there are no lessons to learn from, for instance, having a family full of psychopaths, murderers, rapists and pedophiles. From the stoic point of view, how am I supposed to transcend pain when it was inflicted for sadistic pleasure repeatedly for a decade of my so-called childhood? How can I transcend the pain of never knowing what mother love is? How can I transcend the pain of losing everyone I care about?

I like the notion in Stoicism that moral virtue should be at the top of everyone's priorities. In fact, I lost everything and nearly lost my life because virtue matters the most to me, and if I get a re-do I won't change a thing. I guess my problem is that I don't understand how to resolve 'pointless pain' that offers no lessons, but still haunts me to this day.

Any advice would be appreciated.",Stoicism,1705094748.0,t3_1956aaq,0.61,2
Feeling the weight of time: Struggling to find my path in mid20s,"




I didn't work the entire 2023 year and I don't even have any health insurance. The only thing I did was trying to complete classes for college. But I even missed two semesters because of personal problems and stuff. I'm also feeling lost in life despite being in mid-20s. I just can't seem to find my path in life like career wise. I feel like I'm too old for college especially going in university because it seems like time consuming and finically expensive. I'm currently in community college and they do offer various certification programs and even two year degree programs but I'm not not sure what to get into as Im worrying like stuff about Ai expanding then bunch of layoffs happened. I want to get in a career that will help in long run and be substantial. I'm just stuck in this rut for about a year and even this new year hasn't been to a great start. I just can't afford myself sitting at home doing nothing. I'm just allowing my mind and thoughts control me. I'm tired of this anxiety and fear. Not having understand of life makes me feel weak and overwhelmed. I'm lacking confidence I guess and I'm just trying to find my way out. I previously so far only have fast food and retail experience but because I'm not driving, I'm kinda in a tight spot like transportation is issue in my area so I even applied to remote jobs but obviously I have hard time finding too sighs. So I'm just in completely messed up spot in life right now. Don't understand what to pick and choose or what to do first or something. I even worry like the world is changing so fast and it's important to learn essential life skills like doing your taxes, understanding how the economy works and the direction it's going. Multiple online courses are there like courses, Udemy, Google certification, Microsoft and so on.",Stoicism,1705092794.0,t3_1955i8o,0.85,9
Struggling to connect with others - feel like I am repeating the same thing over and over again.,"Life seems to be a constant struggle. I feel like I am running around in circles, infinitely so. 

I have struggled with depression for a long time (and I also have Aspergers). My depression is kind of situational. If I have friends, work and things to do, it doesn’t emerge. But when I don’t, life doesn’t feel worth living. I take mediciation for it (and therapy) which has helped immensely, but I can’t help but think that I seem to be stuck in this cycle that I cannot seem to break out of. 

My depression led to me dropping out of high school. Despite this, I worked my ass off at home and made it to one of the best colleges in the country.

While I find it easy to make 1:1 connections with others,  I never seem to connect with groups or make a solid circle of friends. The 1:1 friendships I have are often really intense but for one reason or another they die out. And for really inexplicable reasons. Sometimes they will go back home, then when college starts they suddenly don’t want to talk much or hang out anymore. I don’t get it.

I graduated college with great academics but not much to show for it in the way of friendships. For career reasons, I decided to do a masters program at again one of the best colleges. But I seem to be struggling with the same problem. I can have great conversations with a lot of people. But I don’t have a group. And sometimes I’ll arrange things with people, but people have yet to invite me to anything, except for birthday parties. I want to be hanging out with people, going out, having a good time. Yet I seem to be alone on Friday night, again, while everyone else is doing exactly that. 

I can’t seem to break this cycle I seem to be stuck in. I think my Aspergers may be a part of why I can’t connect in the same way that others do, but I can’t seem to figure out what I’m doing wrong, even with therapy. I don’t know how much more of this I can take.",Stoicism,1705092228.0,t3_19559zv,0.5,0

[DISCUSSION] Investigating Anger is the answer,"Good morning Stoa, a few days ago I came here after I had an *incident*. I got angry and lost my temper.

It was very uncool of me, and that lead to a lot of introspection, analysis, reflections, writing, and research.  

Not only I have come to the realization that I was wrong, but that I have been wrong all my life.

I had the wrong belief systems and worldviews, which rendered my analysis of the situations faulty.

Regardless that I was wronged, I had no business at getting angry, let alone losing my temper. That is never the answer to anything. I had faulty belief systems.

I have reframed my thinking and my belief systems, thanks in partly to Stoicism.

Today I am a better man, I still have work to do to better myself, and I know that the episode was a tilting point in my life.

I thank this sub for providing me with great comments and continuing to provide a source of sanity.

How should you actually read Meditations?,"So long story short...I've been an admirer and reader of the Stoics, particularly Marcus Aurelius, for years. What I'm trying to do is to practice the virtues sufficiently that they become habit and second-nature to me - something that probably will take years if not decades to accomplish. It's a really difficult task and I've messed up (pretty badly) on multiple occasions.

And so I often ask myself the question ""How did \[insert Stoic\] do it?"" At least for Marcus Aurelius it seems part of the answer was keeping himself accountable with his personal journal - what we read as Meditations today. And Meditations is a beautiful book, just...I've found it really hard to read. The problem might be the version, I'm using the Hicks version, but it's always seemed like a collection impossibly difficult maxims that I could appreciate in a moment of serenity but not in a moment of crisis.

Is the problem the version I'm using? Am I studying Meditations wrong? Is it just my fault for being slow-witted? Any advice would be much appreciated.

Yeah it’s gonna be a depressive one

I’m 24 years old, neurodivergent, queer (and last year found out that I’m trans, something that my bigoted parents are surely going to love), I have been battling depression for more than 10 years, have binge eating disorder, social anxiety and generally feel like an outsider and that I’m wasting my life 

I live in Brazil and everything here is so loud and confusing and every day I need to deal with a bunch of Ignorant people 

I’m just tired, I’m almost a quarter of a century old and I’ve wasted my life up to this point,  I have no personal achievements, no driving license (I failed the exam), no romantic relationship (although I don’t really care about that just think that it would be nice), no discipline and don’t know how to have it 

Im going to finish college this year and I didn’t even picked what I wanted to graduate, my mom chose that I was gonna be a dentist behind my back without consulting me, and I really don’t want to be a dentist 

I’ve had my ups and downs during those years but they were mostly bad, I’ve cried for no reason during most of my days, have contemplated suicide in a lot of occasions and I’m generally just screaming in my mind “I WANT TO DIE WHAT AM I DOING HERE ?!?!” while looking calm on the outside

My wrath and the chaos inside me has wounded those around me, again. The woman I love is hurt, and scared, and the whole of it lies squarely at my feet. The shameful fallout is well deserved.

Help,"I got into stoicism last year after reading a book called: the little book of stoicism. It was quite helpful, but nonetheless 2023 was the hardest year of my life, I suffered severed anxiety and struggled a lot. The main reason being that I struggled to separate what was outside of my control. I tried journalling every day, meditating and therapy. It did not help, but I am going to keep trying as know it can be a powerful tool. 

Does anybody know what steps I can take to make stoicism a bigger part of my life in 2024, whether that be books, or daily exercises I can do to slowly build up this muscle, as I have always suffered for things that were not up to me, and I need to stop it. I want to improve myself and get better as it often times causes me unnecessary distress and pain.

How exactly does meditation work?,"Some people are coming to the place I work in a few hours so we can showcase some machinery we use. 

I’ll have to be demonstrating something and answering questions. 

I cannot stress enough how bad my social anxiety is. Even knowing I have to make a phone call the next day can be complete hell until I finally get it done with. 

Sometimes I can function well if I just *do it*. But getting in the mindset to just *do it*, is difficult for me.

Help with list of Stoic quotes,"One of the things I lament about so-called ""Stoic quotes"" online is that they rarely, if ever, include the source. As I find myself presently in the midst of a project that requires me to gather roughly 50 brief Stoic quotes, the process of falsifying them as having actually come from who they say they come from is proving quite tedious. 

Many of them are poorly paraphrased so it could take me an hour or two to find out where they came from and, by the time I do, they might not even carry the same meaning as the malformed quote did. 

If you have the time and inclination, dropping one or two of your favorite quotes (with sources) in this thread would be helpful... if not to me specifically, as I might not find your quote specifically applicable to what I'm working on, to anyone looking for a trustworthy repository of Stoic quotes with sources!

Confusion on Justice,"Cicero says “men are induced to injure others in order to obtain what they covet” and this is unjust. If we take that literally and think of it as a mugging then the mugger is operating from a misguided or distorted viewpoint, that much is clear.

"How Stoicism Helped Me Throughout the Years, Despite Key Misunderstandings","*I hope this little tale can serve as inspiration for those of you interested in Stoicism only as a shield and less so as a toolbox. A*s it turned out for me, it provided and even more powerful operating system.

&#x200B;

I first stumbled upon Stoicism in 2012 as a graduate. I read ""Letters from a Stoic"" as I imagine newly converted Christians read the Bible; quite literally and with great joy and fulfillment.

At the time, I was a young man who had listened to everything from Dan Pena, Joe Dispenza, and to some extent Tony Robbins, even though he always seemed too ""guru-ish"" for me to really believe in. Stoicism provided me with the operating system I needed at the time.

However, I mistook being stoic for not letting emotions get to me. This served me very well for years. I overcame one challenge after another, climbed the corporate ladder quickly, and moved all over Europe in search of additional personal and professional growth. By many metrics, I was a young successful man with everything ahead of me.

One day, I realized my current job and life situation were no longer challenging. Despite making good money, living in a safe and affluent city, and earning a decent amount while traveling often, I was bored. I needed action. So, I took the leap, leaving that job for another and moving once again to a different city in Europe.

It was shortly after making the decision to move again that I realized much of my boredom and lack of growth where I was actually had very little to do with my surroundings, and everything to do with myself. By, in a Stoic manner, turning off most of my emotions, both the highs and lows of my intense life felt bland.

Shortly after, I returned to Stoicism and this forum. I realized that Stoicism is really about accepting feelings and then ""applying"" Stoicism, instead of using it as a mental filter to mute feelings and numb sensations. At one point, I was afraid that this new approach would make me lose one of my strongest abilities in life: to endure hardship.

But, as it turns out, this new way of interpreting Stoicism, for me, provided an even more powerful operating system to tackle everyday life. I learned how to accept feelings, embrace them, and power through. The acceptance step became crucial, as it helped me feel pain, enabling fruitful reflection and therefore progress.

I hope this little tale can serve as inspiration for those of you interested in Stoicism only as a shield and less so as a toolbox. If possible, try to repeat my misstake :)",Stoicism,1704895967.0,t3_19396dw,0.87,11

The Jean Valjean problem. Does stoicism indeed say he should not steal bread?,"Wanted to raise this question after listening to a discussion on a podcast. I am having some issues with it, so I'm coining the phrase the Jean Valjean problem  


In Les Miserables, Jean Valjean steals bread and is cast into prison for it. He eventually escapes and becomes a better person. 


The problem for stoicism as I understand it is the theft part. I may not understand stoicism correctly here,  but I believe that since stoics state virtue is the highest goal, and that our own life is less important than this, stealing a loaf of bread to survive (assuming for the sake of argument it is a life and death situation,  no escaping the thought experiment by claiming another option like borrowing money to buy bread) is considered less virtuous than not stealing and succumbing to death. 


I am not sure if this is a correct interpretation,  but I cannot agree with it for 2 eeasons:


1) Life isn't worthless. The value of continuing life at the expense of stolen bread is worth it. The value of a life is more than a loaf of bread so even though theft is not virtuous, it is excusable in this situation. 


2) life is worthwhile specifically because permitting a life to continue,  even at the expense of virtue, means that the person can grow and become virtuous over time. They cannot do that if they are dead. 


Thoughts? Opinions? I may be taking too many liberties with my interpretation of stoicism here, so please correct me if I am off base.",Stoicism,1704862317.0,t3_192zznc,0.93,24

Seeking comfort after dog’s loss,"My childhood dog, best friend and only company has passed away after fighting tumours for last 4 months. I am 22. Yesterday was supposed to be a regular veterinary visit and schedule to remove one tumour. He was 12, turned it just 1 month ago and was a golden retriever. He had multiple tumours which were operated and taken out, but one kept coming for the third time. It was his 4th operation in 4 months. Last days he was not eating and drinking that much as his tumour was in his mouth and was bleeding and hurting him. He went to the car so happy, full of life. I knew that it would take him but not that quick. Vet took him to immediate operation as his tumour started bleeding heavily, and we were told to pick him up in few hours. Upon arriving, the vet said he removed it and that he is slowly waking up but still bleeding so he advises to leave him overnight. At 9PM we got a call that he passed away after failed reanimation. My world broke.

We didn’t properly said goodbye. I can’t believe that the last picture of him is from yesterday shortly before leaving. My family is broken too. What hurts me is that he died without us, after promising him that we will pick him up as usual. Last night was tough, barely slept at all. I am on and off from stoicism in last year, but I know core concepts and it helped me a little. We are to bury him tomorrow as we have to pick him up today. It shook me to my core as I remember passing of my grandpa which was a huge part of my life, let’s say the same way (without anyone, alone in hospital bed due to Covid).

how do I attain happiness in my routine and life?," I've recently reflected on what had brought me joy in the past, the current moment and also could in the future. This is a copy of my thoughts, and I'd love to hear other people's thoghts on it :)

so, how do I attain happiness in my daily routine and life? 

Everyone want to be happy, and there are different ways for people to achieve that, each person has their own way that they persue. Taking my mates for example, at least what I see on the outside, they occasionally go out to parties, get high and drink, eat junk food and those are usually their highlights of the day. 

But that's not what I truely enjoy doing. Literally today, had my first pizza in probably three years, and it was seriously pretty bad. The taste was actually aweful. I felt nauseous afterwards, and regardless if I had a group involvement in my class I would prefer to pick a different, more nutricous meal for lunchtime. Thinking back to when I had a streak of a couple of days of being active, excercising and eating enough nutricous food, I literally get a sense of freedom, acomplishment and expecially peace.  

This was one of the things that brings me back to my question: How do I find happiness and purpose? Since it doesn't seem like a reasonable option to have a completely concrete step-by-step plan to be happy, since things change and you need to adapt, but I am aware many perspectives, healthy and unhealthy, picking the option for delayed or instant gradification, and in the long run it's always better to opt for the delayed, healthy option. Just recently I've watched a video, it's blantly obvious but the things that you are doing now are not effecting you right now, but rather the things you did years, months, days prior do. And in reverse your future depends on what you literally do at the current moment.  

So how do I attain happiness in my routine and in life?  

I need to find a balance between work and life.  

Currently I need to get education going and persue the path of excellence in academics. Afterwards I will be able to have a job that is high paying, so I can do whatever I want, not be constrained by a lack of rescources. Of course not to forget that for long term happiness it's highly important to pick a job that you actually enjoy doing, possibly using the method of ikagai, and also considering your established type of intelligence that you were born with (reference from a podcast that robert freene was on and mentioned that matter in his book mastery, the types are: linguistic, logical-mathematical, inter/-arpersonal, naturalistic, musical, kinesthetic and spacial intelligence; source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/harvard-psychologist-types-of-intelligence-where-do-you-score-highest-in.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/harvard-psychologist-types-of-intelligence-where-do-you-score-highest-in.html) ) Additionally, reflecting on the chliche suggestion that you should be enjoying your teen years while you can (go out and party, get drunk, high, not care about what you fuel your body with, when you sleep, etc.) I personally don't consider that view of ""enjoying your young teens"" as true enjoyment.  

In the moment in which I reach the top of a mountain after a high hike, having delicous dinner after a long day, waking up for a tasty breakfast, the morning sky, the sunset, the sun rise, the colors that the sky can take during different hours of the day, the way clouds move though out atmosphere, the acomplishment when you start comprehending an interesting topic, having deeptalk with a friend, the butterflies that you suddenly get when seeing a certain someonehaving music literally run through your veins when inducing it or just listening; the flow when reading an incaptivating book, the adrenaline kick when doing some crazy activity, sights of cities, landmarks, nature, different cultures, architecture, languages, customs, fashion or just calm walks acompanied by your close ones or just just yourself; there are endless opportunities that are here to be discovered, literally endless.  

Drifting back to reality, above I've listed multiple examples of things, that some far have brought sincere joy to my life and contributed to my life's purpose. Ejoying existing while growing for the betterment of myself and humanity. Obviously those moments cannot, at the time that I'm writing this down, happen on a daily basis. Right now I am given the opportunity, all ressources necessary, to educate myself, get a job and open the door for many more occassions which will bring me joy. 

It's absolutely obligatory for me not to let into brainfog, to start neglecting my health and being able to enjoy the simplicity and beauty of raw nature due to my dopanime receptors (and just my physical and mental condition) be fried to the brim of exctintion. Not let myself forget the hidden dangers of instant gradification and get in a hellish loop that day by day would bring me closer to depression, anxiety, shame and even death.  

So how do I balance my work and free time in a sustainable, meaningful way? 

It is of significance to consider that laying out an unrealistic schedule of a self-improvement type of guru is not going to be beneficial because of multiple reasons. The motive of it isn't really wrong, but the execution is usually not backed by scientific proof, and a sense of purpose. Why do so many people fail their new years resulution? Quiet frankly, they are not thinking about both long and short term dradification. There needs to be a balanced amount of both, else (at least that's what it's been like for me) it's not maintainable. It's so simple to skip going to the gym and  just have that last junky snack, because it's so much easier to do so. Instead just show up to the gym, don't obligate yourself to do a full on three hour workout, seriously just show up and do the bare minimun. Only thrity minutes is totally enough. If you've done, and keep picking this option consistenly, then you can do whatever would please you afterwards. Usually when you've already brought yourself to start, show up for that half an hour, is what it needs to get the stone rolling for a more productive way of living. You will get endorphines by doing the sport, a happy hormone, and the meal after excersising always tastes better if youre slightly worn out.  

And if you consistenly repeat an effective, maintainable routine, you will eventually reach a point where you can do whatever, whenever, with the people you love. That doesn't mean you can't do those things in the process of getting there, it is of most significace that you incooperate enough healthy happiness boosting activities into your routine in order to be able to sustain the discipline. Because in words it's easier written than done, actually do the due paper, decline unhealthy habits, but it can be done. You need to reward youself with ""natural"" induced gradification (note: look these methods up, backed up science based evidence), self reflection, self awareness and a sense of purpose.  

It's impossible to summarrise how to have a sense of purpose briefly, but the main point is that every person has their own, evolving purpose/reason to live for. Since the world is evoling and so many things are out of my control, I rather focus on the things that are in my power, like picking to go on a peaceful walk, enjoy a couple minutes of chilling with my loving cat, etc, that give me some direction of purpose. Do things that are genuinly meaningful to me.  ",Stoicism,1704761683.0,t3_1921ix9,0.75,4

Any Stoics turned Pyrrhonian?,"I used to be a Stoic but now I find it too dogmatic, making assumptions that certain things are to be considered good and others bad, with no evidence that this is indeed the case.   

I feel like Stoicism was a step in the wrong direction from the Skeptics. Yes, you can't refute ALL knowledge, but you can certainly refute absolute value statements. 

Helping someone else isn't inherently good or bad, it's just helping someone else. Virtue assumes dogma..

Come to think of it someone who doesnt care what other people think of him wont be nice tl sit around, someone who only care about himself and his opinion is stupid, cause criticism are ehat build us and make us better when to know you should maybe improve your health sometimes you're of the opinion that your is great, but maybe someone says your health is bad and you're fat should i just ignore him cause he is external then?

I am going through incredible pressure from my surroundings and the feeling of being stabbed in the back.," 

About a year ago, I started a project with a few friends at that time. We were just a branch of a larger project that someone initiated in the capital city. The completion of that project was supposed to bring benefits to all of us. Hoping for a positive outcome, I handed over complete control to my friend at that time. We went through a tough period together, working hard and under a lot of stress. I lost 5kg due to anxiety, and it also cost me a lot of money. The project was completed a few months ago. The people in charge in the capital city are now working and reaping the benefits. I waited for them to call me and offer something, a job or a way to earn money, because we went through all of that together. However, they never contacted me. Now I find out that all this time, they were communicating with my friend who was the coordinator for my area, but he pushed me aside and is collecting benefits for his closest circle of people and family. I am practically excluded from the story even though I did everything that everyone else did, even more. My family and friends ask me every day when something will come out of it, when I can expect something. Some people even have expectations that I can help them, even though I can't help myself. It's very difficult to be deceived and betrayed, especially in a small town. I don't know what to do; I don't have contact with people from the capital city. Also, I wouldn't want to confront my 'friend' because maybe something will come from him. Please advise me because I can't sleep at night, and I can't bear to see my sad parents because I was deceived in some way.""

Of course, I replied ""I agree 100%"", but it made me think of Stoicism and this sub.

What is the *""Stoic""* answer?

We know that the world runs mostly on emotionally-driven decisions, we see it every day; so is it *silly* to wish otherwise? Should we as Stoics be like Ninjas, not wishing that the world were different, but improvise, adapt, and overcome life's situations as they manifest themselves to us?

I’ve been coming out and being more open about my sexuality but often times my thoughts are irrational and fear based ill think that the person is gonna spread this information or visualise them telling their friends and spouse.

Another example is recently I told my coworker about my sexuality and I was shaking and my mind was racing throughout the next few days, about whether they would tell others or fear of rejection. I come from a muslim family and they don’t know and alot of my fear stems from them finding out and selfishly I stay at home as a dependent and save money and plan to move once I graduate university.

For new Stoics...,"With the popularity of Stoicism, like from Ryan Holiday and Massimo Pigliucci. People new to Stoicism should learn that they are referred to as Modern Stoics, which is a secular part of Traditional Stoicism. They leave out the most important part of Traditional Stoicism, Providence, and living according to Nature. If you read Marcus, Seneca, and Epictetus, Nature is foundational and is the only way Stoicism truly works to reach eudaimonia or happiness. If you are serious about Stoicism, learn how the Stoics viewed everything from a cosmic standpoint. Without it's not true Tradition Stoicism as the ancients taught, it's a secular form.

"The Jedi code sounds like it was written by a stoic, and the Sith code a hedonist.","*There is no emotion, there is peace*.  

*There is no ignorance, there is knowledge.*  

*There is no passion, there is serenity.*  

*There is no chaos, there is harmony.*  

*There is no death, there is the Force.*  

The first line I’m not sure I completely agree with. There are things like rational joy, but in a broader sense I think stoics would at least agree in part. Emotions are contrived from our judgments, which are a construct. Inner peace though is a common stoic theme, and is the result of sound judgment, not false beliefs assented into emotion.

The second line reminds me of a theme in stoicism that the true stoic sage is never upset, because he only has knowledge. Socrates famously said “the only sin is ignorance”.  

The third line is another stoic tenant. Marcus Aurelius talks in the meditations often about avoiding passions as they can take away from your rationality and sound judgment. A good sound judgment and an understanding of nature, will result in a natural sense of serenity and joy.  

The fourth line is again, often brought up in stoicism. I interpret chaos here as “unnatural”. Everything is natural, therefore nothing can be unnatural or chaotic. Chaos is a perception. A vicious storm isn’t chaotic, it’s just a storm. A result of nature that brings harmony and balance.  

And finally the last line. I’m not precisely sure what metaphor is meant by *there is no death*, as there is of course death. Maybe they meant you ought not to fear death. Maybe they meant you never really die because you’re resorbed back into the force. And the force could be interpreted in stoic physics as *the logos* as the ancient philosophers say.  

With all that dissected here is the sith code by contrast. You can make your own interpretations, but I think it’s clear why this doctrine is adopted by “the baddies” in the Star Wars universe. It clearly leads to a troubled, never satisfied, self destructive, vice consuming soul.  

*Peace is a lie. There is only Passion.*  

*Through Passion, I gain Strength.*  

*Through Strength, I gain Power.*  

*Through Power, I gain Victory.*  

*Through Victory my chains are Broken.*  

*The Force shall free me.*

"On Virtue, Asceticism and the Request for Help","Hi everyone

I would like to ask you what exercises you need to do in order to grow in virtue. I read Marcus Aurelius several times, but I abandoned it in favor of the diatribes and the encheiridiona of Epictetus. I also read Cicero, whom I like very much because of his understanding of virtue.

1 Specific question: what do you think about asceticism as a preferential good that purifies all vices from man? Such as laziness, lack of self-discipline, and so on. Of course, this serves as a preliminary stage, for it is known that the man who tilles the soil, has uprooted the weeds, cut the earth, and sows or plants, that is, develops virtues. That's not to say that he hasn't done it before, but that getting rid of the superfluous helps. What do you think? (P.S. I'm a fan of Cynic asceticism)

2  Can virtue be exercised and will it always be present until we neglect it? I'm afraid that virtue is only an exercise of judgments in the mind that we hold onto, and that when they are lacking, it turns out that there is no virtue and never has been? After all, if it turns out that Stoic virtue is just a matter of the mind, I think I'd rather have Cicero's teaching on virtue than the Greek masters.

3  Do you have any internships that you can recommend to me? The reason I'm asking you this is that I'd rather deal with practices than just theoretical scripts on a lot of websites. I believe I can learn a lot from you, so if you would like to share some advice with me, I will be happy to hear it.

Please be patient and understanding, I'm not even sure if I gave the right flair (I'm sorry if I chose the wrong one). I try to learn new things and analyze what I already know, whether what I knew was really right.

How to manage stress in gaming (and in general)?,"I'm a young man getting slowly into stoicism. It is like 4th day since i started reading about it more (I'm still in the middle of reading one of William B. Irvine's books, it's my first). I like playin a lot of dynamic, stressful games like e.g. ULTRAKILL. I think im playing rationally - trying some tactics, doing stuff to manage problems (prioritizing enemies, defending yourself etc.). Nontheless tend to feel a lot of stress. At first i was still raging, hitting my desk, but today i felt a bit of a progress - i was still very stressed, i sometimes felt angry, however i remained calm and ""took a deep breath"" and went ahead. It might be also be caused by the fact i'm at my grandma and i don't want to make noise.
This applies to even some activities. In fact, i feel stress rn writing this (dunno why exactly tho). After trying to imply Irvine's suggestions in my daily life i feel better - i usually felt like people want the worst for me and they treat me as someome worse. Nowadays i feel less affected, like i don't care. Only time i felt bad was when my friend called PlayStation 3 gay (yes, he has xbox lmao) as i have huge nostalgia for this console.
What i want to ask in summary - is there a way to calm myself down after a big dose of stress and is it bad for me, as a stoic, to feel stressed in gaming?",Stoicism,1704558937.0,t3_1903u81,0.5,0
Hi Stoics! Lend me your ear a moment please!,"Hey guys. I feel the desire to be very detailed here but I’ll try to keep it short and hopefully not break any rules while I’m at it.

I am 40 years old and I’m about 3 years outside of deconstructing from a lifelong Baptist brainwa… I mean, faith. I had always butted heads with fellow Christians, I always felt like it was all pretty fake and vain, and I was one of those delirious young Christians who thought I had a special connection with God, a certain special empathy for other human beings or something.

Anyways, when I was 35, my left foot started going numb and I figured it was just a pinched nerve in my back. Fast forward 3 years and now the numbness spread to my whole body, and even neurologists at Cleveland Clinic can’t figure it out, and say it has to be something genetic. (This is where I could really ramble, so I’ll stop myself here).

This was the straw that broke the Camel’s back, this is what finally pushed me through deconstruction and take that terrifying leap of ironic faith. I read a few books like Leaving the Fold, Age of Reason, etc. A lot of books on buddhism were also helpful in learning to meditate, but I felt like it was flirting too much with religion.

Then I read Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations, and that was it. Lights out, this dude spoke the language of my very soul. I’m happy to have found Stoicism! My biggest problem is that I am still so very hung up on my anger and resentment towards Yahweh, its so bad that it colors almost all of my thoughts. I still feel like a dictator is lording over everything. I still mentally lash out at him in my darkest times, even though I know I’m screaming at the void.

So, long story short, how do I kick this Jesus habit? Thanks for reading and sorry if I offended anyone. That snarky, passive aggressiveness towards Christianity is THE very thing I’m trying to address.

Edit: I know I could and should post this over in the ex-christian sub, and I’m definitely a lurker over there, but it can be a bit of an echo-chamber in there.",Stoicism,1704557978.0,t3_1903h7a,0.88,7
Why do I feel differently?,"Over the past year I have made some improvements to my mental health. I had a mental break back when I found out my wife's cancer returned, lost motivation to continue improving myself and then was diagnosed with moderate ADHD (which I had no idea until now age 28). I can hear my thoughts now, I can process my emotions and I can put what I'm feeling to words. I've began working out consistently, being active in my daughters' lives and being a husband for as long as I am given. My parents and sister (Who I hold in high regard) have said that I have changed and they feel they have to walk on eggshells around me. I don't understand this since I am no longer quick to anger, my emotions aren't volatile and I'm healthier than I was in highschool.  Why do I feel I have improved and my family thinks otherwise? My sister stated that I seem more entitled and less worried about those around me in a sense that I won't run to help at a moment's notice, but inside I don't feel that way. I know I'm happier, healthier and in my opinion have improved substantially.",Stoicism,1704555153.0,t3_1902gi4,0.72,3
Is this correct?,"So i have started studying stoicism and its been two months, and i have been journaling about a month of the thoughts am having daily and the judgements i pass onto things i try to examine those.

I won't go into much details and make this really long. Here's a brief context of the stuff that happened. Well i do corporate job and everyday we have requests which gets assigned to our team and whoever available senior will assign it to the resource who is available on that day. The problem is things get suddenly escalated to higher management and we need to complete those tasks ASAP.

What has happened one of the senior on my team assigned the request/task to me while i was on my week off. I got angry as to why she assigned the task but i did not confronted her because i was angry i just took the action just to remind her not to assign to someone who is in week off.

And i journaled the whole thing.

and it goes something like this.

Anger  
\------------------

An emotion which happens. When thare is Something unjust has happened.

Did that thing did unjust to me?

Well it was unjust. But let's not get into conclusion.

Let's think it this way.

Is assigning tasks is Something People Shouldn't do?Y  
es they should.

If they Should do then whom they should assign?  
The People who are available.

Now did she assign to Someone who was available on that day?  
NO .

I mean you do not serve food to a Person , who is not there to eat.

Then we know that you should assign the task to Someone who is available .

NOW

Is assigning task to Someone who is not available is an unjust act?

Its not an unjust act as she doesn't have knowledge as to who was available and who was not.

Hence anger should not have come there but we did not assent to that and did not made an impulsive act.

Afraid of how my family would react to my lack of beliefs,"Yeah that's basicallly it. In a nutshell, i was raised by a loving christian family and ended up becoming an atheist a year ago, without them knowing it. 
I love my family more than anything, and they help me a lot, my brother is like a father to me as he taught me a lot of the values i have today, in which some correlate to that of Stoicism.
But the problem is, i stopped believing in God. I am not seeking for religious advice or anything, because it just doesn't make sense to me in believing in a religion again, what i am struggling with is how to deal with it when it comes to my family. I know they would get sad and maybe even exclude me for it... I feel helpless because as far as i am concerned i am the only one in my family that doesn't believe in the religion and that makes me feel lonely and unmotivated.
Not only that, but oftentimes i feel like i am being too selfish, in the sense of ""They did everything to me and now you just leave everything"", specially towards my mom who struggled a lot to raise me.
Its been weeks i am dealing with this, and this questioning in my head is destroying me, i just can't work properly anymore with all of this.
I would like to know how me, as a someone who considers myself a stoic should deal with this, i even considered returning to the faith but i did that twice before and i relapsed back to atheism and i am afraid it could happen again

Grieving for the lost health,"I've had flu-like symptoms for six months. All kinds of physical effort, like walking or standing, feel horrible. This has led me to grieve for my health. I know every single human loses their health eventually. I had plans. I know everyone will have plans that will be cancelled permanently. What difference does it make if it happens now or in 40 years? If you have seen a day, you have seen them all. And I have experienced life already.
Some things have been harder than before for me lately, but what difference does hard or easy make? Why would an easy life be more valuable for me?
Truth is, I have no way of knowing how long all this will last for me. An even firmer truth is that this is all just the beginning. Losing health, among other things, is inevitable. Not just for me but for all. Why lament the natural state of life?

Woman I love is very hot and cold,"I know this is not a relationship advice forum but still trying my luck.

And since last one year our text increased, she starting sending pics, and I just started falling for her. She forced me to tell what I felt for her. I'm glad I could tell her that I loved her. But ever since then she's treating me very hot and cold. Sometimes she would be very interested giving all her focus, calling, etc. Other times she ignores me for days. Eventually I end up expressing too much through messages. She told me she was feeling love bombed. After trying to have a deep conversation with her, she told me she's not a regular type of woman, and that she doesn't want my love, it was more of to feed her insecurities and ego, and she is more of grey kind of person.

When is it okay to give unsolicited advice?,"Hello,

&#x200B;

I tried looking for a similar thread but found only posts talking about receiving unsolicited advice rather than giving it. So, I apologize if I'm retreading ground here.

&#x200B;

Basically though, I find my relationships with my friends suffer because I give off an aloof disposition (not on purpose). Many times my friends will bring up a problem they are having and I'm usually quiet. This is because I am worried about unsolicited advice or otherwise overstepping boundaries.

&#x200B;

I know it's quite okay to voice my opinion when explicitly asked, but find it harder to do so when my friends only imply they'd like advice. And often, I'm not even sure if that IS what they're implying.

&#x200B;

Because of this I think finding a deeper connection is sometimes difficult. Maybe I give off the vibe that I don't care, or perhaps it seems I am trying to change the subject outright.

&#x200B;

I also feel like I am denying my friends the decision as well. And I'm denying them a deeper insight into who I am that kind of prevents them from being comfortable around me. Maybe it seems like I'm hiding something or am coming off judgemental/stern.

&#x200B;

Well, what do you guys think? Am I caring too much what my friends think of me when I'm silent/reserved? Or do I just need to care more about authenticity? And when is proactively giving unsolicited advice acceptable?

&#x200B;

Would love to hear your thoughts on this. Thanks for your time and hope you're all well.

I am not new to Stoicism, I have read the classics and Pigliucci/Irvine; and I know that Stoicism is not about suppressing one's emotions.

I am posting here because the mods allow *""Seeking Stoic Advice""* posts, and because the comments here are the best quality comments across the entire Reddit ecosystem.

I am an old(er) Redditor and I have come a long way in my life; up until not long ago I thought that my life was pretty great, then the other day I lost my temper, something that had not happened in a very long time, and that I thought it was gone from my personality; but there I was. And it was ugly. I was ugly. Details withheld because they don't matter. Losing one's temper is uncalled for. Period.

But my reflections on what happens has led me to keen observation of my MO(s) and behavior, and I have come to the realization that:

1. I don't perform well in confrontations
2. I don't perform well under stress (stress real or imagined)
3. I play ""nice"" by default, but then turn ugly in situations #1 and #2 above.
4. So really, I am not that ""nice"".

I have read ""No More Mr Nice Guy"", as well as ""Not Nice"" and ""The Disease to Please"".

Dear members of this Stoa, if you are still with me, besides my Stoic practice of reading and re-reading the classics and selective modern Stoic writers (I don't do Ryan H), daily journaling, daily journaling challenging my belief systems, what resources do you have for me to better myself?

I am also looking into my insurance benefits for going to therapy too. I have been in therapy in the past for depression and then declared depression-free (and I believe it).  I know I have some problems with anxiety and, of course, anger; but I do believe that anxiety and anger are related.

I started keeping a journal of the worst things that happen to me every day.,"About a week ago, I started keeping a little journal on my notes app of the worst things that happened to me each day.


It has helped me to change the way I view things and to realize just how insignificant most of the little daily “evils” I encounter are. 


This is my list from the last few days:


MONDAY: broke the yolk of the egg I was cooking.

TUESDAY: stepped on some dog poop barefoot.

WEDNESDAY: woke up at 3:30 because my son was crying, couldn’t go back to sleep.

THURSDAY: son went to bed about an hour later than usual. 


This has helped me to stop catastrophizing a ton. I was grumpy all week. And the worst thing that happened was I lost some sleep and some free time and also stepped in poo. If that’s the worst thing that happens this week, fortune’s smiling on me. 


Of course, if I were to get fired, or have a loved one die, it would definitely be worse than those things, but it would likely help me appreciate the good days all the more. 


Try giving it a shot, you’ll likely find that most troubles are not of dire consequence.

Edit to add: I know I should have a stoic journal where I write about how I respond to situations, work on virtues, etc. That being said, I don’t have a ton of time, and this is definitely a 30-second exercise rather than even five minutes",Stoicism,1704491909.0,t3_18ziu36,0.86,15

In love with an addict,"I'm in love with an addict, and I recently our relationship. When I broke up with him, I told him that part of the reason I was ending things was that I loved him too much to watch him kill himself. I was experiencing a lot of emotional distress because of his addiction and the way he was letting it impact his life and our relationship. He's a truly beautiful man, with a heart like none I've ever met and more love to give that I ever knew was possible, but was destroying his health and making it impossible to maintain a romantic relationship. 

From a Stoic perspective, I'm curious how to navigate our post-breakup friendship or whether I should not have one with him.  

Would growing as a Stoic mean learning to accept his self-destructive tendencies, and choose to serve as a support and friend if he chooses to get sober? Would it mean lovingly holding him accountable when he asks for support, and pointing out his patterns when he wants advice? 

Or would growing as a Stoic mean accepting that a leopard cannot change its spots, accepting that remaining in his life may be harming us both more than anything, and walking away? 

I will greatly appreciate any wisdom or experience this community has to share. ",Stoicism,1704486712.0,t3_18zgrmc,0.6,2

Virtue is the only good. Not the reach for contentment.

We embrace/love/wish for whatever happens/has happened and do not worry so much about how other's define/label that. We are happy in whatever is going on because what does that have to do with our character?

We deal with life as it happens, and do not lose our way. This includes opinions, authors and ""sophists"" we do not agree with. As Epictetus and Seneca both share, we can objectively describe a thing for what it is, we observe that a course called ""The Wealthy Stoic"" sounds like a contradiction and a confusion, but it isn't Stoic to then assign that value to the person beyond that observation.

This is Stoicism. If this doesn't feel right, then maybe there is a false impression somewhere in there to work through, or maybe this isn't the philosophy your nature is set to follow?

Lost,"

So right now I(20m) am in my third year of college and honestly I have no idea what I’m doing as in I don’t know what to do with my life. The bachelor that I’m studying for now is biology not because I’m necessarily interested in it but because engineering is too hard for me considering I suck at math and political science is also uninteresting to me.
All throughout my life/high school people would ask me what I was going to study and I would always tell them “I didn’t know” thinking that eventually I would know and I could answer their question and my question but here I am and I still don’t know. I haven’t found anything that really interests me nothing to the extent I could see myself devoting time and effort into it. I play a lot of video games but I don’t like it enough for me to learn how to make a game and I watch a lot of movies and TV shows, but don’t like them enough to pursue a career in cinema for example and to top it all off I’m not good at anything(no talent,no secret hobbies,nothing). I’m trying not to sound ungrateful, but to put it simply nothing is ever enough It all feels empty to me. People have told me that it’s normal to be directionless in this stage in life and I understand that but at the same time is very frustrating seeing my friends in college just knowing what they’re going to do with themselves whether it be veterinarians, lawyers, programmers you name it and I wish I could be like them. Needless to say, this is all having a negative affect on me is bad enough to go through life’s struggles, but I would say its worse when you don’t have a “why” to your struggles. I don’t feel like I’m asking for too much when it comes to just knowing what I should do. I’m not asking for that perfect dream job. All I want is to know what I should be doing with my life, something that I can see myself doing for a long time and be good at it, and get meaning from it but I don’t have that and I need help.

Today, 5 out of the 10 plates arrived completely shattered inside the box. I was disappointed at first, but I didn't feel angry or upset... I sat down with my broken plates for a minute and contacted the store, so far they didn't reply (the store has a reputation of bad customer service). 

I'm thinking about just throwing the broken plates in the trash (carefully packed of course) and buy new ones soon from a different place.
While I was sitting with my plates looking at them, it hit me so very hard that this is so out of my control and there's no point in being disappointed or mad, it's broken and that's it. I'll just ask for the money back and count my losses.",Stoicism,1704465221.0,t3_18z89jk,0.72,9

Question concerning the Stoic view on abuse from family.,"
I have some issues with a stoic view on abusive family and I’m curious how you all interpret the passage. 

Very quick backstory: After years of therapy I’ve stopped speaking with my mother due to narcissism and abuse. 

Stoicism has been one of the most valuable things in my life and has helped me through so much. I have been very troubled upon a re-reading of Epictetus and would love your interpretation.

“Duties are universally measured by relations. Is a man a father? The precept is to take care of him, to yield to him in all things, to submit when he is reproachful, when he inflicts blows. But suppose that he is a bad father. Were you then by nature made akin to a good father? No; but to a father. Does a brother wrong you? Maintain then your own position toward him, and do not examine what he is doing, but what you must do that your will shall be conformable to nature. For another will not damage you, unless you choose: but you will be damaged then when you shall think that you are damaged. In this way then you will discover your duty from the relation of a neighbor, from that of a citizen, from that of a general, if you are accustomed to contemplate the relations.”

In the book A Field Guide to a Happy Life, Massimo Pigliucci’s rewrites Epictetus in more modern language. Here is another example of a stoic response to abuse from family.

“But,” you say, “my mother has been bad to me.” Perhaps, but she is your mother nevertheless, and you should concern yourself with how you behave toward her, not how she behaves toward you. “But my brother has done me some harm.” What do you mean, “harm”? Has he forced you to change your considered opinions or the values you endorse? No, he can’t do that. Then there is no real harm. He may have behaved unjustly toward you, but that is his business. Your business is to behave toward him by considering who he is: your brother.

So, after years of therapy, I have broken off my relationship with my mother. It was a very difficult decision but the correct choice. Reading these stoic passages that I have posted really upsets me. Does Epictetus really expect someone to allow pain and suffering inflicted upon them just because you are related to them? Standing up for ourselves and choosing not to be harmed is within our own power, so I had thought I made the stoic decision to choose not to be harmed anymore. Perhaps this passage from Epictetus is a relic of ancient times in which you could never sever ties with family regardless of the situation.

What do you think?",Stoicism,1704445748.0,t3_18z2mw3,0.61,2
"I need practical, real-life advice on being alone.","I don't lack social skills or anything like that, I just don't particularly like most of the people I go to college with. The people that I do actually like, never show up to class/ come very rarely so I can't really hang out with them.

I enjoy my own company and do not feel the need to spend all of my time with people, but it gets exhausting to not have anyone to talk to/ hangout with during breaks in between classes and such. Studying during these breaks doesn't always work and I do start to feel lonely/ crave social interaction.

What should I do? I need some help/ motivation to be able to make it through college.

Wondering about this quote.,"Hi everyone. This is my first post ever on Reddit and I hope I did respect the rules… 

I found this quote an hour ago on Stoic. And to be honest, I’m really new to Stoicism and I’m wondering how to interpret it. 

« Floods will rob us of one thing, fire of another. These are conditions of our existence which we cannot change. What we can do is adopt a noble spirit, such a spirit as befits a good man, so that we may bear up bravely under all that fortune sends us and bring our wills into tune with nature’s. » Seneca, Letters from a Stoic

To be more precise, I don’t understand what the first sentence have to deal with the rest. If some people can lighten my mind it would be great!",Stoicism,1704439480.0,t3_18z12id,0.57,1
Seneca on duties,"Seneca asserts, citing Democritus, that 'a relatively tranquil state of mind is only possible if we devote relatively little time to public or private affairs, or at least to those that are too great for our strength' in Book 3 Chapter 6 of 'On Anger'. He then goes on to suggest avoiding hunger, thirst, hard study or tasks

I was surprised by this. Having read the Meditations I had the impression that it was best to drive oneself strenuously into one's duties and enduring difficulties by accepting the present moment and modifying judgements. Seneca himself condemns laziness in his letters to Lucilius.

How is this to be reconciled? Is it about working within one's present limits, like someone starting out in exercise, who must begin lightly to avoid injuries that a dedicated trainer would manage with ease?",Stoicism,1704427040.0,t3_18yxc51,0.7,5

A Stoic's Code of Conduct and how to achieve Emotional Maturity and/or remedy Emotional Immaturity.,"I've been practicing Stoicism for a couple of years now, and I do see some improvements. So I am not a newbie and I know better that Stoicism is not about repressing emotions.

Like many of us, my upbringing was not perfect (and I have stopped blaming my parents long ago), and I had a lot of ""issues"".  I have come a long way, I do live a ""normal"" life, dare to say ""happy""; some people would even use the term ""successful"" to describe my life and me.

But I am still working on myself, constantly improving.

Recently I am working on my latent internal anger, and I have come to the realization that I am still, probably, Emotionally Immature.

I have got some good comments on this sub recently on related matters, and I am journaling multiple times a day, reflecting on things, and challenging my own *intrusive thoughts* and also my *Belief System* (aka BS).

I have read multiple times Massimo Pigliucci's *How to be a Stoic*, and William Irvine's *A Guide to the Good Life*; they are book good in giving practical examples of Stoic life.

I am looking to make a simple ""Stoic's Code of Conduct"", a list so to speak that I can review multiple times a day, and in case of emergency, and therefore I am asking 2 questions:

1. Do you have such a list or can you point me to one?
2. Can you please review my incomplete list below, and suggest additions/edits?

TIA

My Stoic Code of Conduct:

* Speak positively.
* Don't be sarcastic (I used to do it too much).
* Never complain.
* Judge a situation or a behavior, not the person.  What someone does is not the reflection of who they are.
* Never say anything negative about anyone (linked to the item above), even if it's true (this is regarding work).
* Pursue the Stoic virtues (of course), always.
* Apply the dichotomy of control, always.
* Don't give into consumerism, lean toward minimalism.
* Journal daily: at night reflecting on the day that just ended; in the morning planning my day.
* Be mindful every moment.
* Pay special attention when interacting with people, be mindful.
* When the mind goes into a spiral down a rabbit hole; just stop.
* You can do it. Whether you think you can or you can't either way you're right.
* No gossips.
* No drama ever.",Stoicism,1704420924.0,t3_18yv8qn,0.9,13
A Life Direction through Determinism and Stoicism,"Some background: (skip if too long)

I'm 16, and lately I've been really struggling to do anything because of not knowing where I'm headed. It all began a few months ago. I was honestly really doing quite well, to which I mean I started being more responsible, disciplined and was focused on self-improvement. I slept and woke up early, took my studies seriously, did daily chores, etc.

I also journaled to write down my thoughts, which mostly consisted of how to improve myself and live better. On one of these journal sessions, I realized that my actions is mostly just problem solving. So I looked into how to problem solve. I read some stuff, and came to the conclusion that it simply boils down to: knowing WHAT to do, HOW to do that, and WHY do that. You might know where this is headed, but yeah, the ""WHY"" part really had me thinking. Why am I doing all this shit again? Why do I eat, sleep, study, have fun, and all the kit-and-caboodle?

So, naturally, I looked for an answer. If the question is ""why am I doing anything?"", then what I'm looking for is reason (or maybe purpose or meaning? idk I'm unsure still). I read about existentialism, absurdism, stoicism, and a few others, only enough to kinda get the gist of it, and I also did some personal thinking. This was where my mind has been for the past few months, and this lack of reason or direction or whatever, has really had me demotivated and depressed.

However, I think I've reached some sort of answer that I'm content with and I'd like to hear your thoughts about it.

&#x200B;

It goes as follows:

Determinism states that all actions and events result from other actions, events, or situations. The way I personally like to word this out is: ""what is"" determines ""what is to be"". ""What is"" simply refers to the state of stuff right now, and ""what is to be"" refers to how the state of how the stuff right now will be.

""What is"" includes me. What am I? What is the state of the stuff that is me right now? Well I am human. And a part of being human, of course, includes survival. But, it also includes the longing for happiness. And I personally think that the stoic philosophy of building character, having virtue as the goal, answers this longing for happiness.

What I'm essentially saying is: Stuff exists, and how these stuff exist, or ""what is"", determines how these stuff will exist, or ""what is to be"". A part of ""what is"" is what I am, and I am a human that longs for happiness among other things. This determines ""what is to be"", which includes my decisions and actions. Hence, I look for what'll bring me happiness, which I believe is found through the stoic philosophy.

(just to add, I recognize that determinism is usually brought up when discussing free will and responsibility, but here, I focus more on the idea it presents about how our actions is explicable by what we are and what other stuff are.)",Stoicism,1704420821.0,t3_18yv7e9,0.5,0
Does anyone else feel stressed when trying to apply Stoic teachings?,"It's not the teachings themselves that stress me out but rather the fact that Stoicism as a whole is a life guide and basically offers an answer for almost all scenarios.

It's so stressful to always think about what's right and what's wrong and hesitating a lot to indulge in good food or watching anything fun because these things don't contribute to my overall potential.

I'm aware it's considered a waste of time (which Stoics commanded people not to do) but I can't spend my entire time doing the right thing, especially if it doesn't give a feeling of peace or comfort.",Stoicism,1704416975.0,t3_18yttiw,0.76,8

I have trouble understanding this passage in the passage before this one, he is talking about all the relations in the world and the Constitution of the human mind to receive impressions in and that this must be the work of a God. Then he ends the passage with the following

> ""let them explain what it is that bring all of this about, or how it is possible that such wonders that bear all the signs of workmanship come into being by chance and of their own accord""

I cant really put the passage \[12\] into relation to the End  I just quoted above. If you all would not mind to share your thoughts on this passage, and maybe if you think  it is meant to add to the passage from before.

How to confront lies as a wise stoic? ( using what is within control and outside your control),"My freind and i made plans to buy somethings for her party. We already agreed on the day we were to go. The day before i message her askking her what part of the day she wants to go and she does not reply me, or pick my calls even if know shes always on her phone. I then call a freind she lives with, the freind gives her the phone and my freind admits that shes already bought the stuff and shes been busy all day and didnt have time to reply or even call back. 

I know shes lying. In one of the messages i sent her, asking when she wants to go to buy her stuff, she diverts and asks a different question. It seems she was avoiding telling me, and im left wondering why. It seems she would have never admited shew has bought the stuff if i didnt gi the extra mile by calling her freind.  I am wondering why she didnt tell me shes already bought the stuff already. I know shes lying and i refuse to give benefit of doubt.

shes very arguementative and may not admit the lie. Confronting her may ruin the freindship, especially with her birthday coming up, it may be awkward if i attend.

From what I understand Stoic logic was in some ways quite revolutionary and very distinct from some other ideas of the time (Aristotle being a prime example) and while no considerable body of work was preserved, what has been recorded is close to propositional logic which of course is very much in use in the modern age.

"Anger, results and confusion","Ever been lied to? It's annoying, isn't it.

I feel like I've been lied to about a lot of things in my life. Most of them along the lines of ""Just do this and you'll be fine"". Well I did ""this"" and I wasn't fine. These were often people who had duty of care over me and I had little choice but to believe them and ironically were also the people who taught me that not telling the truth was a bad thing.

So deep down, I'm angry. At them for giving me instructions that lead nowhere, at me for being too weak or naive to get the results or to follow the instructions well enough.

If it weren't for that anger I would never have learned to stand up for myself when under attack, it has protected me.

serious question what if you in this position what would you guys do answer honestly,"what will you do if you dealt with this scenario

what if you still living with ur parents and still depend on parents like everything, and then someday your parents order you to do something that you don't want to do cause it against your principle, but if you not do what parents ordered you to do, you will not get any money ,transport like cars or bike, but you still need all that to go to school or college.

the stoic way must be like its okay i will search part time job etc so i don't depend on my parents again cause that what i can do

Issue with stoicism practices.,"I bought the handbook for new stoics, and have been working through it starting this year, I've already hit something of a road bump, the first exercise is to take an aspect of your day and seperate and examine what was and wasn't in my control, the issue I'm having is that I don't do much at all, I mostly stay inside, watching youtube or playing video games, I'm diabled and thus can't work.

So I don't really have an ascept of my day to examine, the book suggests things such as lunch with a friend or a work meeting, but I have nothing similar to those, the only thing I've been able to write about is my usage of social media, but if I use that as my example I'll be writting the same thing for each day of the week.

"Stoicism, The Prince, & The 48 Laws of Power","So I've been trying to be Stoic (I'm not that good at it yet), but I've recently experienced a large setback due to not being more instrumental/practical in my thinking.

I've been studying the 48 Laws of Power & The Prince. Are power, leadership, and the teachings of these works simply incompatible with Stoicism? Much of what they say make perfect, rational sense, but they don't seem to be in line with the actions of the philosophy.

Machiavelli says:
""Any man who tries to be good all the time is bound to come to ruin among the great number who are not good. Hence a prince who wants to keep his authority must learn how not to be good, and use that knowledge, or refrain from using it, as necessity requires.""

I made an inappropriate joke to someone and their reply was hurtful. How do I subvert my expectations of being apologized to?,"This is a fake scenario based off of a real problem I'm having.

I'm confused in how to feel and how to respond to they way someone reacted to a joke I made.

So let's say I, Jack, made a joke about vegans to my friend Mark, who is not a vegan but has told me previously that they don't like jokes at the expense of vegans.

After telling my joke, Mark said ""shut up, that's offensive"".

Now, upon reflection I realized that I made a mistake. There's no doubt in my mind that the initial mistake was mine. However I still feel hurt due to being told to shut up.

I have apologized for making the joke, and Mark hasn't apologized for his response. I feel like I expect him to apologize. Should I not?

This is something which isn't yet clear to me in the stoic teachings. I lack ""the wisdom to know the difference"". I know his apology is out of my control, but should (or could) I tell him that it was hurtful and that I would like if he doesn't do it again?

Or do I just change my expectations to such a degree in which I won't expect to be treated with any respect?

Stoic Perspective on Dealing with Wrongdoing: Vladimir Putin and Modern Challenges,"I’m intrigued by how Stoicism, as reflected in Marcus Aurelius’ philosophy, would approach contemporary issues like Vladimir Putin’s actions and the impact of propaganda and advanced warfare technology.

Is the first step to forgiving someone that you perceived wronged you to control your thoughts or your actions?,"There is someone who in the past hurt me. A family member. For a while I was angry but eventually I let go of the anger and decided to just stop interacting with her. I would be short and blunt with her and would not attend events that she would be at. The largest part of my anger was that she never apologized to me. 

I realize now that she did not injure me in anyway. The things she said that were true I had no right to be upset about and the things that were false equally were unimportant. 

I am able to now interact with her and be pleasant as if I harbour no negative emotions. I act with her as I think I would if nothing had happened. 

However when interacting with her I feel a negative emotion. Sometimes the remains of anger and sometimes some sort of sadness towards how I was treated. 

I feel as though these are not passions since I am not allowing them to affect the way I act but they do seem to affect my thoughts. It’s something I’ve been struggling with for months. I’m not sure how to approach it further. 

In my mind I rationally know that what happened was not something I could control but the way I think about it is however the emotions still occur whenever I see her.

Shaving your beard,"Please excuse the paraphrasing, I do not have my copy with me.

Epictetus says that if one is to practice philosophy, their conviction should be such that they are willing to lose their head if another demands they behave in a manner contrary to their philosophy. This is conveyed early on in the discourses in a metaphor about shaving one's beard.

He also says that one should not try to pursue causes that are out of one's control, because not only will one disgrace themselves in doing this, they will have abandoned a pursuit in which they could have performed well. This is from enchiridion 37.

A topical example is a hypothetical US citizen that believes that US aid to Israel is cruel. This citizen decides to not pay their taxes, in accordance with their philosophy. But then they are jailed, preventing them from the good they could have done while not jailed, and Israel still receives the aid because there are hundreds of millions of tax paying citizens. 

Quote 2 implies it is a better idea to just follow the law and pay the taxes. Quote 1 implies that we should not care for the consequences.

Am I misunderstanding? Is there a discourses chapter that elaborates on enchiridion 37?

Thanks.",Stoicism,1704248153.0,t3_18x7ore,0.64,5
Bushido and Stoicism,"I’ve seen here several people mention how stoicism has similarities to some eastern philosophies. Before I discovered stoicism for myself, I studied the samurai. I wanted to know why they were portrayed as calm people in media and culture. This is one of my favorite quotes and I believe it fits the stoic goal of calmness. Perhaps even fear of death. This comes from Inazo Nitobe (1862-1933). He was born into the samurai class, but was 6 when it was abolished. His book, “The Way of the Samurai” is one of two books that most influences samurai media. That and the Hagakure. 

“The Way of the Samurai” Chapter 4: Courage, the Spirit of Daring and Bearing

“The spiritual aspect of valor, is evidenced by composure - calm presence of mind. Tranquility is courage in repose. It is a statical manifestation of valor, as daring deeds are dynamical. A truly brave man is ever serene; he is never taken by surprise; nothing ruffles the equanimity of his spirit. In the heat of battle he remains cool; in the midst of catastrophes, he keeps level his mind. Earthquakes do not shake him, he laughs at storms. We admire him as truly great, who, in the menacing presence of danger, or death, retains his self possession; who, for instance, can compose a poem under impending peril, or hum a strain in the face of death. Such indulgence betraying no tremor in the writing, or in the voice, is taken as an infallible index of a large nature - what we call a capacious mind, which, far from being pressed or crowded, has always room for something more”

Roommate situation,"So I recently had a conversation with my roommate about the importance of putting organic trash in the organic bin instead of the garbage bin.

In order to be a good and just person should we correct lies we have told or bad actions we have done even if they will hurt the person?,"In an attempt to be a better person I am trying to right things I have done in the past and be an honest person in general. 

For example, in a joint business in the past I was under reporting revenue and over reporting expenses in order to pocket more of the profit. To right this wrong I have a cheque written for the difference to give to my partner. My question now arises in if I should tell him that I was stealing from him all this time. 

As I am someone he trusts immensely this would upset him and I am doing it to make myself feel better. 

I could alternatively lie and say ""I found some mistakes in the numbers, looks like you're owed this much more"". 

Is lying to make him feel better a stoic action?

I've analyzed this situation and I am not scared to tell him that I betrayed his trust. I am able to accept any fall out from it. I would obviously prefer to have him in my life as I consider him a friend but that is a decision I think he should make, not me. 

I feel as though I am starting to ramble now so I will stop shortly. 

I compared the situation to if I was told by a recent ex she was cheating on me the entire relationship. I would feel upset over that and think that it was unnecessary to tell me this additional information after we had broken up. 

The business is still running and I stopped playing with the numbers recently. 


This also made me wonder if we should go out of our way to correct any lies or misinformation we have given people or to just be honest going forward.

What things are determine what things do. Is this true? What does stoicism have say to this?,"Here's the gist:

* Wise 16 year old gains consciousness 
* Doesn't know why he does what he does.
* Wonders ""what am I doing?"" and ""why am I doing it?
* What SHOULD I do and why SHOULD I do that?
* Wants a clear life direction.
* Tries to figure it out for months.
* Can't figure it out. Isn't satisfied with any answer. Finds despair instead.
* Has trouble doing anything cause of not knowing why he does what he does, or for that matter, why does ANYTHING at all do what they do?
* Reaches some sort of conclusion, which he still doesn't find satisfying so then asks reddit cause doesn't know where else.

~~~

The conclusion:

- Things just exists.
- These things exist in certain ways.
- The ways that these things exist can change.

This is reality.


What things are determine what things do, and what things do determine what things are to be.

ie. What a thing is and what surrounds that thing (the universe/ the earth/ society) determines what it does, and what it does determines what it becomes and what surrounds it becomes. 


If this is true, then:

What to do?
What you do is determined by what you are and what other things are.

Why do that?
What is done is done because of what you are and what other things are.

~~~

So is it that simple? I wake up, I eat, I bathe, I study, I draw, I choose a goal, I love, I survive etc. all because of what I am and what surrounds me? Is it logical? Should I just accept this even though I dont feel satisfied with it? From my understanding it does, but does stoicism agree?",Stoicism,1704205335.0,t3_18wqjj2,0.5,0

Contradictory quotes?,"Dear Posse.

Does ugliness rub off?  Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius seem to disagree, or can Marcus Aurelius’ words be interpreted into “ugliness will only rub off, if you let it”?

“Avoid fraternizing with non-philosophers [i.e., people who don’t try to improve themselves]. If you must, though, be careful not to sink to their level; because, you know, if a companion is dirty, his friends cannot help but get a little dirty too, no matter how clean they started out.”

Epictetus, Enchiridion 33.6

And 

“When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they can't tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are unnatural.”

How to maintain relationship with parents while keeping my peace?,"Sorry, it might feel like a rant, but I don't know how to summarize what goes in my mind.

I ooz hate/anger in my head when I speak to my parents when they ask me to do things certain way. I usually listen for one or two times, and then in straight words, I tell them that I dont want to live that particular way  but if they want to, then it is their choice. My father  just switches the topic or hands over the phone to my mom. One time, when I recommended something then my mom said that she would listen from one ear and let it out from other. 

Part of me doesn't want to have any relationship with them, and the other part is like that they are growing old and live thousands of kilometers away.

2yrs ago, I stopped sharing my life with them over our daily calls unless it impacts them in some way. I really dont say much. I just listen to what they have to say about their life and leave it at it. This is out of respect what they have gone through to support me in whatever way, and I know they didnt have it easy.

However, I can't deny I question my choice to call them every single day because for them it doesn't matter as it's part of living life and I overthink. After all this, they try to associate with me, and I have noticed myself being instantly repellant to that association as I don't want to be like my parents. 

I don't mind being the bad person in their lives, but my heart doesn't allow me to cutoff ties or make them lonely or carry resentment as they age as it is not healthy.

Yeah i know star wars is silly, but these quotes are the kind of thing that make me question some stoic principles.

Marcus Aurelius wrote to himself ""If it is endurable, then endure it. Stop complaining."" but isn't complaining a natural human response to stress? An stoic can even fool himself thinking that he can endure everything ""endurable"" only to snap like a brittle twig at some point.

Isn't having hope and goals two of the most powerful driving forces in humans? Yet stoicism says hope is the twin brother of fear. And even fear can keep living beings alive, same with anger and stubbornness.

Trouble with knowing which emotions are reasonable,"First: I mention some heavy thoughts, but I am in no active danger, so please don’t report this. I am in therapy, but I also want some logical input, because rationalising thoughts helps me. Thank you. 
 ———

To make it brief - I know that the right mindset can change *a lot*. That is what I struggle with the most, right after controlling my emotions (as in, not letting them control me). 


I am in therapy and have also started recently mood stabilisers, as my psych thinks the intensity of my emotions is not normal. But obviously I still need to work in therapy on actively calming myself and changing my mindset. I’m doing CBT which overlaps a lot with Stoicism. 


So:  I’ve struggled hard with guilt, shame, and as a result suicidal ideation for years. I often want to open up to my family about it, but I’ve been told even just breaking into tears over small disagreements is me being “manipulative”.  No words can convince my father otherwise, not even from my therapist. So just the idea of being vulnerable to my father (who has plenty reasons to be disappointed by and angry with me, as he is) and telling him “I don’t want to be alive anymore. And I feel guilty that I know I won’t ever attempt suicide because I believe it would be better for you. But I am too selfish even for that.” is terrifying. Not to be able to tell your own parent you wish to stop living, because you are used to negative responses to opening up, is so painful and invalidating. I don’t want pity from him, I want empathy and to feel loved. My suicidal ideation is real, and I need help. But it doesn’t go away from one therapy session, and I think beging honest about how you feel is important for well being. So not being able to be honest with my own father is… I am repeating myself. 


But is it “reasonable” or “okay” to feel sad that I can’t tell own father how I feel? Can I tell him anyway because it weighs so heavily on me, or should I keep it between myself and my therapist? Because isn’t the **reason** I’m sad that I care what he thinks? Is it “reasonable” in Stoicism that I want to trust and be loved by my parent, to want empathy from him? Or should I work on not caring what he thinks, because then, well, then I won’t let myself be controlled by my wish to get love from him? 


I am at a loss. To not care what my own father thinks of me seems so so cold and irresponsible. I am scared that if I don’t care what he thinks of me, I will might behave in ways that hurt him. 


But then, if he feels hurt, wouldn’t that be his responsibility and because of his mindset? 
But that sounds even colder. 


I don’t know what to think. I just want to be happy, and the man who said I need to ask for help more doesn’t understand that the best way for *him* to help me is to be empathetic.",Stoicism,1704150312.0,t3_18w9k4u,0.79,8

Hello everyone. Needed some information and guidance from fellow stoicists. Would mean a lot to me.,"It's gonna be pretty unorganised so please bear with me.

My first point of concern is if I am doing something wrong or harming myself in any way by studying and applying stoicism?? That's my biggest concern right now. I am reading stoicism a lot and it has brought to me a lot of changes. I need to know if I am setting myself up for some bad outcome.

Here's some changes that I have observed after starting stoicism.

1. I have stopped getting post jut clarity. I know it sounds silly but it's a major concern for me. I used to have post nut clarity for when I used to feel low or needed to clear my mind. Now I can't. But I do get some resemblance of post nut clarity when I am reading stoicism. So I don't really know if that's a good thing or bad thing.


2. I have become way better in making friends. Earlier I used to have trouble getting respect from people now I am doing good not as much as I would like but far better than earlier. But I think I have lost my charming capabilities too. Earlier I could enjoy parties and be fun there too. Now I just dont see any point in parties. Everytime I see someone enjoying parties and getting out of control, I start judging them which is a wrong thing.


3. My other concern is that girls don't follow stoicism and it makes me prone to getting cheated on. Somehow I can't shake the feeling that getting complacent and indifferent leads to your partner getting a free hand and cheating on you.


4. I would really appreciate a mentor who has been actively practicing stoicism for a long time now.

People thinking I don't care,"Happy New Year all,

In practicing emotional control and not immediately reacting to a negative situation, has anyone else run into other people thinking you don't care?

Take for example, if a significant issue or mistake occured at work, I used to overreact to show coworkers and management how much I cared, but I eventually realized this caused me too much mental distress, and was not worth it in the grand scheme of life, it's just a job.

Since becoming a practicing stoic, I am getting the impression from others that my calm/indifferent reaction to situations makes them think I don't care, which is an issue concerning I am in management. 

Has anyone else run into this? My thought is my mental well being is more of a priority than what some boss might think of my level of engagement, and that an employer having an issue with your calmness probably isn't one to stay with.

The Praxis of Developing a Stoic Mindset - How can we actually start to think and behave Stoically? Here are my thoughts on concrete steps to take to begin moving towards the Stoic ideal.,"# Introduction

It's not secret that as this subreddit has grown, a large number of the topics are people seeking Stoic advice. A lot of these posts are however misguided in a way - they seem to be  looking for a particular kind of solution that you might find in an algebra problem. They want something that they can plug into the equation to solve for X, and thus find a neat and tidy answer to their problem - whether that's a broken heart, the effects of childhood trauma, or disappointment at their lack of self-perceived accomplishment in their lives. Stoicism is not a framework for solving for a particular value of X. It is rather a way of deconstructing the problem such that you realize looking for X is the wrong approach entirely. 

The suffering that people describe as stemming from various events (my romantic partner left me, I feel empty and defeated) is the categorical mistake that Stoicism seeks to address. It is a radical and revolutionary reframing of the human experience that begins with the detachment of human value judgment from the events and consequences that are happening every second of our lives. In simple terms, Stoicism would say that the breaking of your relationship is not the source of your suffering, but your impression of it is. If you broke off an abusive relationship and were now freed from violence and oppression, you would see the end of a relationship as liberation. It is your impression and interpretation of the event which creates the condition of pleasure/pain in your mind. And so Stoicism stretches that to almost every single thing that we experience, and demands that we detach from judging things to be good or bad so that we are not living our lives at the mercy of chance and fortune. Virtue is the sole good, and our virtue can never be affected by anything that happens to us, including physical pain, destitution or death. This is of course simplistic, but I wanted to set the stage with a broad overview before getting to the point of this post, which is:

# **How do I *actually* start thinking and acting Stoically?**

**The first step in developing a Stoic mindset is to develop the habit of having structured reflection about yourself and your life.** This means not only thinking about what you are doing and how you are living, but taking active steps such as journalling, and structured review of your thoughts/actions which you revisit later on. The process of putting thoughts into writing forces you to order them and clarify them. Pure mental thinking is ultra-high bandwidth with tons of noise and emotional baggage that cloud the ideas, whereas writing is a kind of structured thinking that forces you to crystallize your innumerable thoughts, and serves as a record for your future self. Its hard to remember what you were thinking about even a week ago, and it's imperative to have a handle on the evolution of your thinking and feeling. 

So if you are at a loss at where to start, start writing daily. Write about your life and your thoughts every single day. What is happening and what is your judgment of what is happening? What do you want? What do you feel is missing? Alongside this, pick a Stoic text and begin reading it. Don't worry about commentary, just read it for yourself first. Slowly, you will see themes from Stoic texts crop up in your life. Reflect on them - are they applicable? Do you agree with the author? Do you find the ideas persuasive or do you disagree with them? Explain yourself and your thinking. Later on, return to your writing and see if your mind is changing. You will be shocked at what you wrote 1 month ago, 6 months ago, etc. It will be a sign of your progress, and this is critical because Stoicism is a journey of self-mastery, and of self-responsibility. It is imperative you keep a written record. 

# **I'm already reading and journalling - what now?**

Our goal is of course to begin changing our minds, and that means achieving some kind of control over our reactions in real-time. In my view, the critical step is looking to carve a space between **action** and **reaction** in the course of our lives. At first, there is no space - we can only reflect on things hours or days afterwards. But as we continue the process of reflection and meditation, it finally happens - we get a brief flash of space between an event and our impression of it. An example from my own life might look like this:

> *Here is a typically angering situation for me. I can see it unfolding. This is a huge inconvenience to me. This person is completely disrespecting me and my time. I feel my blood pressure rising and my emotions lifting. I want to show my anger to this person, but I know I will regret it later. *

And I would still react angrily. I would say something disrespectful back, raise my voice, and lose control of myself. But still - I had time enough to have the above discourse in my mind. I could recognize it all happening, and I still couldn't control it, **but this is the first victory.** I could see the impression forming. And so then you reflect on the fact that you are starting to see the impression forming, you write about it in your journal. And then it happens again. And again. And you fail again. But then one time you catch yourself and actually manage to shift your reaction a tiny bit. You curb your anger. You take a few breaths and instil calmness into the situation. You are still angry but you're doing better this time. It takes less time for you to cool off after. And afterwards when you journal, you realize that this is the first time you've ever been able to stop yourself before fully engaging in the emotional reaction.

We see posts like these on here as well ""Stoic success stories"" - small but important anecdotes where people relay a situation where they caught themselves about to react badly, and asserted control. These victories stem from the earlier step of creating that tiny space.

As you continue to pile up these 'victories', you assert more and more control over your reactions. In your reflections, you begin to truly understand that when people are being rude or disrespectful to you, it is a reflection of their own hardships and ignorance, and nothing to do with you. You start to truly understand that getting angry is handing ownership of your mind to another, usually a complete stranger, who has already forgotten about you while you are still brewing with rage from your interaction with them. And so it becomes more and more natural to simply not react in these situations. 

# The key is to keep it in mind

The general theme here is that in order to begin to think Stoically, you need REMINDERS to do so. You need some kind of process that injects the Stoic principles back into the active thinking patterns and not just the passive ones that are occurring in times of acute pain. I think for most people, that has to begin with active, regular journalling and reading the Stoic texts. The more you think and write on them, the more they will be in your mind. And the more they are in your mind, the faster you will finally achieve that first 0.01 seconds of space between action and reaction, and then that space will continue to get bigger as you gain control over your emotions and cognition. As you gain control, you start to actually see the process almost from a third person perspective. This creates the conditions for further control, for more space, and the process continues and you can sink deeper into the true Stoic mindset.

As you go further, you are not simply getting better at calming down - you are starting to see the events for what they are, and they lose the ability to affect you in the first place. You actually begin to understand implicitly, not just logically, the foundational truth of the Stoic mindset. The logical understanding of Stoic ideas is not enough - 99.9% of you understand them already, but that doesn't magically change your mind. You need repetitions and practice so that your brain grasps it on an emotional level as well. Over time, you are seeing the problem differently - there is no X to solve.",Stoicism,1704132452.0,t3_18w2gxi,0.96,64

On discussing other people,"An excerpt from Simplicius’ commentary on *Enchiridion* 33 follows this chunk:

> But above all things take care not to talk of other People, neither so as to censure their Conduct, nor to be lavish in their Commendation, nor to make invidious Comparisons between one and another.

The commentary: 

> But above all things, he gives us warning not to entertain our selves, and our Company with talking of other People; neither so as to call their Behaviour to Account, nor to be profuse in their Praises, nor free in making Comparisons between one Man and another, as That this Lady is handsomer than That, or this Man Braver, or Honester than That, or the like. Now there is nothing more evident, than that this Topick does in a more than ordinary manner divert the Soul from its self, and its own Business; for it makes Men busie, and curious, and impertinent, extreamly inquisitive, and troublesome where they have nothing to do. But why should this (you'll say) do so more than any other? And what can our talking of other Men have in it worse than the Subjects mentioned before?

> To this we may reply, That the Person to whom the Advice is here directed, being one who hath made some progress in Philosophy, as not so likely to entertain himself with those trivial Matters, as with something that relates to Mankind, and their Affairs and Actions. So that it was convenient to draw him off from those things especially, which his own Inclina∣nations would most dispose him to; and there∣fore he adds that Emphatical Caution, But above all things.

> Besides, though it be true, That the same Affections are stirred in us by both Discourses a∣like, (for we are insensibly drawn in to love and hate things and Men by talking of them) yet there is one peculiar Vice attends our Conver∣sation, when we pretend to give Characters of other people; which is, That it strangely swells one with Vanity and Pride, and Contempt of others. For whoever he be that pretends to sit in Judgment upon other Mens Conduct, does it out of some imagined Excellence in himself, which he fansies gives him a Right to arraign his Neighbours. And besides, any mistake in our Judgments of Men, is more inexcusable, and of infinitely worse Consequenee than if we pro∣nounce wrong in those other trifling Matters; and therefore we should be very sparing and tender in this Point.

Holiday's Influence,"Just thought I'd mention this since I've been seeing some posts about ryan holiday. 

I've seen Stoics here mentioned that despite the twisted and misconstrued picture holiday paints about Stoicism, many people end up finding true Stoicism. Therefore, holiday may not be doing too much harm, but rather a benefit to people. 

I'd like to challenge that by telling my experience. 

I first heard of Stoicism in college, around 2016. I don't recall if it was on a podcast or a YouTube video or an article, but I came across holiday talking about the Meditations and Marcus Aurelius and Stoicism. 

And when I heard him, I easily saw he was just talking bullshit. And I completely disregarded Stoicism too. 

Fast forward, I graduated and got a job in finance in 2018. And one day while at a colleagues desk, I noticed he had the Meditations of Aurelius. This seemed to me to be a confirmation of what holiday was selling: Stoicism as some broski, hustle, self help bullshit that would be big with finance bros (like my colleague).

Of course I was wrong to associate Marcus Aurelius and Stoicism with holiday's bullshit. It wasn't until this year that I really got into Stoicism. And in all of those years, I didn't give Stoicism a chance because I (erroneously) associated Stoicism with bullshit self help. 

To be fair to me though, (and my point), holiday, in my experience, did not only not lead me to Stoicism, but also contributed to the impression that Stoicism was just a bunch of hustle culture self help bullshit. 

I could only speculate how better my life would have been had I given Stoicism a chance and read the Discourses. But that's futile. 

So just as holiday might help bring people to Stoicism, he might also help people push Stoicism away. And so, in this way, holiday might not be helping people. 

What's left for us is to simply guide people away from holiday and redirect them to Stoicism.",Stoicism,1704097173.0,t3_18vsd29,0.67,6

Reflecting on Ryan,"I was blown away when someone on this subreddit pointed out to me that Ryan Holiday's debasement of this philosophy has reached the point of him creating a site called ""[The Wealthy Stoic](https://www.thewealthystoic.com/)"" to openly shill Stoicism as a get-rich-quick scheme.

For years I have been telling people his approach is a poorly disguised get-rich-quick scheme. What he's done has taken all of the cleverness out of that observation - now anyone with eyes can make that observation, which makes me feel a lot less original (and that could be a good thing).

It doesn't anger me when I look at the ""Wealthy Stoic""; the feeling is more like bemusement. Stoicism is exactly the opposite of what he's selling - it's just remarkable that he's chosen such a staunchly ascetic philosophy as his basis for selling people their own greed back to them. Perhaps wrapping one thing up in the other somehow makes the grift more effective.

As the new year rolls in and I start moving towards my fifth year of Stoic practice, it's somewhat interesting to reflect on the fact that feeling as though Ryan Holiday was trying to scam me is what initially sent me to Epictetus, and learning from Epictetus is what unlocked the benefits of the philosophy for me. I had just started recovering from my drug addiction, and I was reading The Daily Stoic and another one of his books (possibly ""The Obstacle is the Way"" but I cannot quite recall). As I read I got the distinct sense that I was reading trite garbage attached to a sales funnel by a person who didn't *really* care for their subject matter, and who was disturbingly enamored with extremely wealthy people who had diddly-squick to do with Stoic philosophy. Feeling certain there must be more value to the philosophy than what I was being given, I googled something like ""who is the most respected Stoic"" and was directed to Epictetus. I purchased my Penguin Classics copy of the Discourses (Kindle edition of course - I wanted to start immediately) and I never looked back.

I can recall an overwhelming sense of joy and relief when I realized that not only was the philosophy far from the trite, vague nonsense Holiday was portraying it as, but I was reading one of the most profound forms of thought I'd ever seen written down - a distillation of all the wisdom I'd acquired in beating my addiction, plus a cognitive mountain of completely verifiable and entirely unique claims about the mind that I'd never have been able to come up with on my own, and which I now use every single day when reasoning about how to live my life. 

I live an honest life. I feel happy - I feel like I never lack courage and that I do not need to lie to anyone. I have a wife I love and I'm content with what I have - truly content, as in if I had my current circumstance for the rest of my life I'd die happy. Better yet, if every single object I owned were lost in some freak accident tomorrow, I'm fairly sure I'd be no less content - I might need a week to get my bearings, I'm far from a Stoic sage after all, but I doubt I'd need much more than that. 

It's strange to feel that way, and to have felt such a profound benefit from the practice of this philosophy, only to then see the person I once thought of as its titan looking haggard and exhausted, shilling get-rich-quick schemes on a scammy-looking website. It drives home a point the Stoics make themselves - that the wealth and power of the Emperor counts for nothing. To Ryan Holiday, Stoic philosophy is nothing but a way to grift - like any criminal, he makes his money robbing the unaware and scamming the credulous. To me, the philosophy taught me how to be happy. When I help people to understand Stoicism I don't do it for money, and I get to feel honest at the end of it, something I suspect Ryan Holiday hasn't felt about himself in a very long time.

Happy 2024 everyone. Let's all try to surpass Ryan Holiday this year. ",Stoicism,1704068442.0,t3_18vkufu,0.92,84

"""Don't be overheard complaining... not even to yourself.”","This quote by Marcus Aurelius emphasizes the importance of not letting any attention flow towards expressing your discomfort with a situation. 

Due to this quote, I notice how often I complain about the most minor issues for the sake of conversation. I am surrounded by many people who complain about things in every other sentence, and it has conditioned me into believing that I must always find issue with something. Even things that in no way influence my life, I will complain because I am not comfortable with silence.

Responsibilities,"I know that the idea of control is talked about to excess. What I can control what I can't control what I should try to control or other misunderstandings. I don't like the word control and I personally think it's a bad translation of the concept. 

Isn't it more productive to instead concentrate on what our responsibilities are? That's a much easier question to answer. What is your responsibility and what isn't your responsibility? Are you properly accepting responsibility for the things you say and do? 

Some things are our responsibility and some things aren't. Trying to accept responsibility for the actions and reactions of others does a disservice to them as maybe they're supposed to be learning a lesson. Trying to make someone else responsible for my actions and reactions does me a disservice because it removes my opportunities to learn and grow. 

For example if I had a child, to say I'm in control of the child would be not very correct. But I'm definitely responsible for the safety of the child as far as I'm able. I can't control the safety of anyone 100 percent.

I'm a coward,"So , recently I was at a train station , trying to book a ticket at a booking booth and I was the first guy to put the ticket in line....later another guy came and argued that he was the first to put the ticket and even though I tried to reason with him he just escalated to the point where he verbally abused me and at that point I have gone to the railway police but he( the police man) said he is not in charge and told me to go to another police station which was in another location ( even though he was in that train station he refused to help me and I don't know why?)so I had no idea what I should do and returned to the booth and he again escalated the situation and I gave up on the situation.As he was trying to book the ticket first (the booking will start in a few minutes), the booking officer said that he cannot book the ticket since the train has already departed, so this guy had a verbal fight with the officer too and left the booth and I ended up getting my ticket first.But deep down I know that if the guy's train was available he would have got the ticket first and I couldn't stop him even though he was wrong.

I haven't been able to stop beating myself up after that situation and had many resentful fantasies as to hurt him or kill him... stuff like that or either kill myself ( but again my mind says if you are going to kill yourself then kill him first and then kill yourself).

Today I went from being right to being wrong. So much for my Stoicism practice.,"Today I was wronged. Someone did something.

I remedied, took matters into my own hands, and with effort and work, I remedied someone's malice or stupidity (Occam's razor).

Stoicism teaches us: 

* I did well. I used wisdom, courage, and justice.
* Now move on, continue to practice virtues, and - why not - do great things with your life.
* It's all done and over with.

But I had to confront that person, ask them why they did what they did. They lied and turned things around, accusing me of not telling the truth. So not only they wrong edme, but now they were trying to do the switcharoo on me? And falsely accusing me?

I tried to reason with them, nope, there was no way. I distanced myself and I reported to their company.  Then, later on, on my way out, I picked up the conversation again, which continued on the same note; till I lost my temper.

So, from being on the right side of the fact I become the villain. I was, the a-hole.

And this is where Stoicism is correct:

* What had happened (when the person wronged me) was outside my control.
* I was able to control some actions that I took to remedy.
* The entire event, now in the past, is 100% outside my control. There's nothing that I can do to undo what was done. Stoicism teaches me to do nothing, because there's nothing to be done. That is the wise thing to (not) do, that is the just thing do to, that would be a manifestation of moderation.

The actions that I took instead, the things I said, the letting my anger take over losing my cool were my doing, I did that, I allowed that, I went into the rabbit hole and continued to go down.

And now I can't sleep (ruminating) and I have been re-living those events for the past few hours. What a waste of life.

Now more than ever I see how the Stoic teaching are correct, always seek to be virtuos, by practicing wisdom, justice, courage, and moderation.

And by distinguishing what is within our control and what is not; and act accordingly.

And to be aware of impressions, since:

> We form our judgments and opinions based on what the Stoics called “impressions.” In broad terms, all stimuli (and our unthinking interpretations of them) are impressions.

Today was an opportunity for me to practice Stoicism at its best. If I had done that it would have been very low effort, just ""doing nothing"" really. I could have moved on with my life, doing something productive in the past few hours, and by now I would be sleeping like a baby.

My life is indeed the summation of the choices that I make, and Stoicism is a great co-pilot, if I choose to follow its advice. Everything that matters is 100% within my control. What is not doesn't really matter.",Stoicism,1704003082.0,t3_18v16fa,0.94,15

How to think when some people are facing hard times (& unfortunate incidents) while you are relatively well off?,"(post is convoluted and might not be comprehensble, I don't know how to express my feelings. )


two incidents made me this ask the question. seeing homeless person and another who is suffering from toxic relationship.

whenever I see homeless person, I feel terrible and physical unease. I usually see on shopping street or when I come out from eating at restaurant, which means I also feel guilty for spending money. (but you can't live without doing that) I don't spend on unnecessary things and don't eat at fancy places, I am still a college student and don't eat out often and most expensive meal I had on my own is $12 and that too twice or thrice a year.  But when I eat I usually see homeless person as I walk home from that place. I donate change I have but still I feel almost depressed. q's like Do I deserve the nice food I just had? why is that person suffering in cold outside but I go to nice, warm house? 


I am aware of very close person I know who suffered domestic abuse and had their life turned upside down, their religious family recognize the abuse but don't want them to divorce. 

after becoming aware of such things I become sad and it feels bad to do things I do and indulge in which are not necessary but essential to get on with my life. (like putting on nice fragrance when going to job interview, while hearing someone I know crying because of abusive relationship feels .... )

This is not a test. This is the real thing.

When your 40 minute drive becomes two hours or your spouse uses more plates and forks than they need and it's your turn to do the dishes or a non-human animal under your care needs to shit some time around 4 am and you always prefer it be outside of the house so you wake up your brain, raise your body temperature a bit and go outside, sometimes you find yourself contorted.
All tied up in a knot for the duration of the bad thing. You're annoyed or angry. You wish to be in a different mental state.

Ask yourself:

Is this not life? In these moments when my (probably not deeply thought out) immediate preferences aren't met, can I not be satisfied? Can I only be satisfied if what I think I want is what I get? No. That seems like asking for trouble. Pre-meditated suffering. 
If I can learn to enjoy traffic then I'll always be satisfied.

My goal is to go from 
""oh, no. There is heavy traffic. My will and desires have been thwarted by circumstance. I will now lament what I cannot have""

Good thing I am protected from the elements, robbers and great distances in my private metal box. It's not what I wanted, but these moments are also my life. I will not spend them lamenting or wanting anything other than what I get. At that point, it's too late to get otherwise. Accept the consequences at once so you can relax your breathing, straighten out your spine and focus on finding pleasure or contentness in the places you're not paying attention to.

"Dealing with sexual frustration, loneliness and weak social skills","Hi all,

I'm a male 28 working as a software engineer. Career wise I'm in a good position and learning everything day by day. But however I found out that I'm quite lonely and doesn't have any plans for new year whereas my friends have plans with their wives and girlfriends. Also lately I have been sexually frustrated and all I do is masturbate when I'm all alone. I am having hard time accepting I have terrible social skills and can't get girls even though I'm a good looking guy. I have been going to gym and improved my physique. But it didn't gave me much confidence. How can I deal with these things and move on. I really want to improve myself. But I feel like I don't have the patience to go through lot of rejection. How can I prepare myself to go through a lot of rejection by women and improve my social skills. It would be helpful if you could provide your views",Stoicism,1703937707.0,t3_18ue68a,0.72,24
What type of journal do you use? Pen?,"I journal nearly daily or every other day. I use a Designworks Inc. Standard Issue Notebook No.12.

How do I control my frustration towards others?,"Recently I’ve felt like I’ve been getting angry or frustrated over the smallest things, including statements from my parents. I’ve tried to calm my emotions, meditation and other techniques but I end up either yelling or getting unnecessarily angry at them due to miscommunication and not being on the same page. 

A recent example of this is my mum nagging me on getting a job (it has been a year since I’ve been unemployed) however during the start of the year she stopped me from getting/applying to new jobs due to my studies and exams. Now in these couple of weeks she’s  been complaining why I wasn’t working throughout the year, saying that, after being unemployed I “gave up” and was “too lazy”to find a job to her friends on the phone. In addition, she also complains/yells that the reason of no jobs accepting me was due to my appearance?!?! That it was because of my moustache and bleached blonde tips (note I am Asian, and she dislikes how I do not look like the stereotypical southeast Asian). Moreover, she sometimes doesn’t realise I’m trying my best, yes I agree I can be lazy and impractical, but they always disregard on what I Do and focus on what I Don’t (not sure if that made sense haha)Like I’ve been really trying my hardest to find a job. This lead me to lashing out and having an argument about it, and yet in the end nothing was understood between us on what we were trying to state, and she ended up pushing it off and blaming herself, that “it’s all her fault”. The same scenario has occurred with just different topics and statements ending in her blaming herself for being a bad mum.

This always made me feel bad, every time I’ve had an argument with my family members I always reflect on what I said and what I should’ve done instead of what I did with my actions, hoping that next time I’m met with this situation I can stop it from getting any worse. 

And I always remember that it is also their first times at living life and that they are also trying to figure their own lives out. With this I really do love my mum and I know she wants the best for me, I never want to see her sad or feel like a failure, she has gone through a lot of struggles and done so much for me, but sometimes our misunderstanding and miscommunication gets under my skin which leads to my outbursts of frustration towards them. 

But I hope that next time I’m able to calm myself in these scenarios so that we are able to communicate better, to be in the same page.

Any tips, techniques, books can help me out would be appreciated!!!

Thank you for listening to my TED Talk haha

"""Isn't the foolishness of a few a more precious commodity than the wisdom of the masses?""-Fate Zero","Gilgamesh: I am fond of lives of hubris. People who harbor grand ambitions without realizing that they are unequal to the task. The mere sight of such people gives me great enjoyment. There are two kinds of arrogance. One where you are unequal to the task and one where your dreams are too big. The former is common place stupidity...but the later is a rare species that is difficult to find.

Kirei: But they are identical in that they are both fools, are they not?

Gilgamesh: Isn’t the foolishness of a few a more precious commodity than the wisdom of the masses?There are those who were born human but harbor wishes that man was not meant for...and have renounced their humanity in its pursuit. I never grow weary of watching their grief and despair. Kirei, what of you?(dialogue from fate zero)

When I read alittle about Gilgamesh, the story says he wished to become a God, one of the Gods. To which the gods agreed, giving him a series of trials which if he passed, he would become a God. One of them involved staying up without sleep for seven days and seven nights which he failed. So in that paragraph where he ""never grows weary of watching grief and despair"", he's engaging in abit of Schadenfreude against himself and all like him. The Stoic sage is an ideal, obtainable? I don't know, but would the stoic sage be considered a human or a God?, a God I think. So isn't it's pursuit a form of renouncing one's humanity on some level? Plato's philosopher king encourages himself  in  his Meditations to ""stick to what seems right""(the best goal to achieve, the one we fall short of when we fail), and to ""celebrate behaving like a human being, however imperfectly"". Well, I feel like we should have a Stoic Failure Story tag to encourage empathy, vulnerability and authenticity even further in this community.

 Arthur Koestler theorized that; when children are impersonating adults, a comedian is impersonating a public figure, men are disguised as women and women are disguised as men. The impersonater is perceived as himself and as somebody else at the same time. That while this situation lasts, ""the two matrices are bissociated in the spectators mind. And while his intellect is capable of swiftly oscillating from one matrix to the other and back, his emotions are incapable of following these acrobatic turns. They are spilled into the gutters of laughter as soup is spilled on a rocking ship. Here I am thinking about Chrysipuss, who Seneca believed ""saw the very bottom of truth"" dying of laughter. Koestler further adds that ""we are literally ""poisoned"" by our adrenal humours, reason has little power over irritability or anxiety. It takes time to talk a person out of a mood, however valid the argument;passion is blind to better judgment; anger and fear show physical after affects long after their causes have been removed. If we could change our moods as quickly as we jump from one thought to another, we would be acrobats of emotion"". And I'm not sure why but this brings to mind Arriana Huffington's quote, ""sleep is a feature of the human operating system, not a bug"". Which is why Gilgamesh probably failed to become a God. ""But what says Zeus? ""Epictetus, if it were possible, I would have
made both your little body and your little property free and not
exposed to hindrance. But now be not ignorant of this: this body is
not yours, but it is clay finely tempered. And since I was not able to
do for you what I have mentioned, I have given you a small portion
of us, this faculty of pursuing an object and avoiding it, and the
faculty of desire and aversion, and, in a word, the faculty of using
the appearances of things; and if you will take care of this faculty
and consider it your only possession, you will never be hindered,
never meet with impediments; you will not lament, you will not
blame, you will not flatter any person.""_Discourses 1.1. I heard Peter Theil once say that if someone could innovate a pill that would safely eliminate the need  for sleep, he would move the world from zero to one. In a way though, this person would be considered a fool, the same way we think of Socrates, Diogenes, Epictetus as having moved the world from zero to one for championing a philosophy that has stood the test of time. And yet I feel these guys where probably considered fools on some level in their time, just as I believe they would be considered fools in my current society if they lived now as they lived then. ""..the truly original geniuses are rare compared with the enormous number of talented practioners; the former acting as spearheads, opening up new territories which the later will then diligently cultivate. There are periods of crisis, ""creative-anarchy"", leading to breakthroughs to new frontiers, followed by decades, or centuries of orthodoxy, consolidation, stagnation and decadence-- until a new crises arises, a holy discontent which starts the cycle again....""_The Act of Creation.

For a bit I thought I was making mild progress. 

Perhaps I’m just tired, but today I was bombed by the thought that my chronic illnesses 100% prevent me from being happy, so I’m excluded from the benefits of Stoicism. I was stuck and couldn’t seem to find anything that I’ve read so far to help me out.

Are we always in control of our thoughts and reactions?,"I'm completely new to Stoicism and currently reading ""The Little Book of Stoicism"" as my introduction to the philosophy.

I've come to the point in the book where freedom of choice is being covered in depth, specifically the idea that we're unable to control external factors in our lives however we always have control over how we perceive and react to these things, the section also mentions that only we have the power to ruin our lives.

I'm struggling with these concepts a bit.

I believe we can control how we react and behave to an extent but only within our given biological parameters paired with the environmental stressor. I think certain situations are harder for some, easier for others.

E.g. 

- There are people who have behavioural difficulties that descrease impulse control
- There are others with severe mental health issues which can cause executive dysfunction
- Addicts exist whose brains will crave a substance as though they would die without it (they may also suffer with one of the other bullet points to boot)

While a ""good"" choice can still be made, the ability is reduced when compared to neurotypicals with good mental health.

Despite the above, I've still found the ""You can always control how you react"" approach really helpful. My worst life decsions have been made when emotions are running high, there have been had countless past worries that I've tortured myself with causing unnecessary suffering.

I've tried to adopt a more mindful approach when my emotions are high and I've seen good results... however there's a limit. If lost everyone I cared about tomorrow, I would be unable to remain calm in the same way Viktor Frankl did or see this as something indifferent to my eudaimonian. (Things we cannot control being seen as ""perferred indifferents"" at best.) My happiness is partly tied in with those I love and I'm not sure I'd want that to change because it would feel like cutting myself off emotionally. I get that it's unhealthy to entirely rely on those around us for happiness, but for me to care is to be emotionally invested. I believe that to love is to accept the possibility of emotional pain.

I'd like to get thoughts from those more familiar with the philosophy though please.",Stoicism,1703894447.0,t3_18u1fx5,0.7,5
how can I stop worrying about these things that are out of my control," Title. I am an 18 year old guy, and for the past week, I have been experiencing fatigue, nausea, dizziness, and derealization. I was in a very bad rabbit hole a couple days ago, that I still am some-what still in, but have gotten ALOT better.

I kept googling, searching on reddit, trying to figure out what was wrong with me, and so I started to think I had: long covid (since i got it in july) , CFS, diabetes, kidney disease, bppv, dysautonomia, candida overgrowth (which ive now found out is fake), sibo induced symptoms (since i have gi issues for over a year now) , gastritis induced symptoms, you name it and i probably thought I had it.

I've found out alot about myself while going through this whole rabbit hole, and I've realized that im not really scared of ""death"" per say, I am more scared of not living my life because of a chronic illness not allowing me to live my life, and there for because I keep worrying about that, I don't really live my life.

My anxiety has gotten so bad, that now I can't really go to the gym without thinking I am having a heart attack or I keep focusing on the littlest things when working out. Like how much I yawn during my workouts. While I do think most of my symptoms are from my anxiety, I just can not help but think in the back of my head that there is some chronic condition that I have, that is also causing these symptoms. I just don't know what to do. I am trying to look for a therapist, and potentially get an evaluation done to see if maybe I'll need anti-anxiety meds?

My question basically is: how can I stop worrying about these things that are out of my control like dying, or developing a chronic illness that doesn't allow me to ever function or live my life again, and while all my friends are out partying or living life, I will be bed ridden and depressed.",Stoicism,1703889378.0,t3_18tzixa,0.83,8

Anyone who has been both ugly and attractive has lived through and knows this. There are also many research studies that prove that attractive people are perceived as more likable, receive higher salaries, and get far lower prison sentences.

Today I dealt with a toxic person in a stoic way,"Long story short 2023 was a really bad year for me, I was learning about stoicism but got away from the path at some point and let my negative emotions and anxiety dominate me 

I was super anxious about a college exam and so asked my friend if I could go to his house and say that I was worried, after that I got a bunch of messages from his jealous and egocentric girlfriend (who I used to call my friend) calling me a bitch that I was trying to have sex with him and saying that I was ugly and etc 

I tried to explain that I just wanted someone to talk with and even said that I was aroace but she ignored it

After that I noticed that I need stoicism back to my life and read meditations and took the idea of the 2.1 text “ I shall meet with the busybody, the ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial. All these things happen to them by reason of their ignorance of what is good and evil. But I who have seen the nature of the good that it is beautiful, and of the bad that it is ugly, and the nature of him who does wrong, that it is akin to me, not [only] of the same blood or seed, but that it participates in [the same] intelligence and [the same] portion of the divinity, I can neither be injured by any of them” 

And realised that that’s how she is, she’s aggressive and insecure and there’s nothing that I can change about it, today she tried to hurt me again and I simply ignored her, why bother with toxic people ?",Stoicism,1703875341.0,t3_18tu41m,0.92,68
Stoicism in the face of injustice,"I'm wondering, as I haven't been through all the literature yet, how do stoic deal with severe types of injustice.

For example: A mother fought very hard to safeguard her child from an abusive husband.
The child is safe now.
However, disease and misfortune strikes the mother and after a long struggle, she dies, leaving her child vulnerable again.
All the while, the abusive father runs rampant, never being held accountable for his deeds, experiencing the bare minimum of bad luck.
Worst case scenario, custody gets transfered to the father.

In a more severe case, this is the story of a sibling; or your mother.

Overcoming a major life mistake,"Would appreciate some guidance on how might a stoic best navigate a major life mistake?

I feel humiliated and defeated.  I know the past cannot be changed.  So all I can do is calmly set about dealing with the consequences in the present.

My mind, traditionally very determined and focused, is lacking the discipline to stay away from the humiliation mindset, the negative self talk, and the desire to keep going back to the past to fix things.  I allowed the initial situation to jar me so deeply that I fell in a vicious cycle.  That cycle drained everything out of me.  I speculate that’s why my previously strong mind seems almost unruly now.

How does one regain one’s head after losing it?  I don’t know if perhaps any of you has had any personal experience with this.

Moving from fear of death to acceptance of it,"I’m looking for some stoic perspective on thoughts of death and negative visualization.

Recently, a few months ago, I had a surgery and ever since then my little mind is obsessed with the thought of the implant causing my death eventually. Thus, I notice I fear exercise, stopped hobbies, seeing friends, have no motivation for life. Some would call this a depressive episode, and suicidal thoughts were there for a few weeks but I overcame them after some time in therapy. As residue I feel like the fear is a  constant.

While I know that these are just thoughts, they seem to subconsciously define my living now. I keep analyzing my symptoms, the physical pain sensations, and mind feeds me images of me dying. And instead of accepting them, I fear them and am obsessed with them. I find it impossible to focus on anything else. Prior the surgery I found negative visualization a very powerful technique for relief and gratitude but now it only feeds the fears and suffering. Weird.

I have read a bunch of posts here on health, aging, and death, but I felt like reaching out nevertheless. Does someone wiser here have any perspective to offer me on this situation?",Stoicism,1703846640.0,t3_18tkdef,0.69,7
Is there any semblance of a Path offered in Stoicism?,"I was having a discussion with a friend of mine on the differences between Buddhism and Stoicism.

In many Buddhist traditions, there is a clear path to follow towards an enlightened state of mind. E.g., Lam Rim in Tibetan Buddhism. This path involves a defined set of practices to follow that are graduated according to different capabilities. Meditation is the core daily practice in the path.

By following a path, I mean following practices hat are different than simply acting as if one was in the end state already (acting in an enlightened way). For example, in Buddhism, there are practices of focusing on the breath or another meditation object; also practices of doing body scans of various parts of the body. This has little to do with enlightenment itself, but is more about training the mind in ways that are conducive for enlightenment.

In Stoicism, we hear of the most ideal ways to act in multiple life situations, but are there any paths or practices offered by the philosophers to work towards making those ideal ways to act come spontaneously (vs. just trying to act in a stoically correct way as much as possible from the beginning)?

Dreading the dawn of a new year and beyond it,"Some of you might be thinking, aren't t people supposed to be happy and feeling fresh for a new year. Well not so much for me. I'm a teenager. I got to put up with harder subjects, difficult teachers, in a new environment because of changing classes and having to put up with my family's reprimands or strict ideals. I know this might all sound minor.

But to top it off, I've experienced possibly the most gruelling period of my life I had ever faced. You might want to read my posts back in around April-July this year. Assuming that you've read my posts, I have developed a trauma towards the whole experience. I do not want to degrade others with much worse traumatic experiences. I'm afraid that next year I will have another ""gruelling period of my life"". Now the one back in April-July left me traumatised, so it makes the fear much more scarier. I'm not traumatized by the event itself, but the process of overcoming it. I went through a lot of struggle just to cope and overcome. And it was so arduous to go through that now I am intensely afraid of experiencing that same pain and struggle of overcoming another occurrence. Sometimes when I come across scenarios where the atmosphere feels similar to one of the situations back then, I would actually start to become self-conscious and panic. I would physically feel my heart starting to feel uncomfortable. Again, from an external view, this might seem a bit minor but for me it was definitely damaging so bear with me.

A part of me knows going through it is necessary for growth and learning. Since it was exactly that period of April-July that forced me to find something to help cope with things, that being finding Stoicism. Any similar hurdles in the future may also present the same kind of opportunities. 

But I can't help but worry and fear that similar things will occur in the next few years of my life. Just imagining having to go through so much of that same traumatic struggle. And this trauma causes the fear of suffering to overpower the fear of remaining static or the lack of growth. I also can't help but worry about the far future of my life as a whole and all the difficult things I need to deal with along the way. But I'll assume I won't live that long, and even telling myself this isn't enough (I am not suicidal by any means).

I'm aware that there are many stoic doctrines that can help with my situation or that this anxiety is just fleeting and should just live with it. But despite that I still can't help but worry. And I'm really starting to lose my ground to the present. It just keeps occupying my mind full of these scary images. And I don't have the time or privacy to randomly close my eyes and spend 5 or 10 minutes to mentally rehearse all my approaches(that's how I personally do it).

Wanting other peoples lives,"I’ve been trying to study Stoicism and focus on my own life and improving it, not in a selfish way but just making my life better. One thing I can’t get rid of is the comparison to every body in my life. It makes it hard for me to focus on doing the right thing and putting effort into my life because I just want what others have. I want to live and experience stuff they do. How do I stop wishing my life was different and focus more on where I’m at now so I can be a more virtuous person?",Stoicism,1703823685.0,t3_18te45f,0.67,3
"Recently started studying stoicism, what direction to go for better emotional control over things I cannot change?","A little background, most of my life I’ve been extremely stoic without even knowing what it was. Until I was 26, I would even say it was bordering on pathological and uncaring. I went in the military after high school and had never found anything emotionally difficult in my life, be that deaths of family or friends or anything else. I felt nothing, no honor, pride, or anything, even regarding my time in the military. Everyone would tell me how weird that is to not be proud and I never really understood that until now. 

At 26, my life took an extremely sudden turn. Following the break up with the only woman I had ever loved, suddenly, and if by magical intervention, I began experiencing emotion on a level I failed to control or understand. The first six months were absolutely horrible but since then I’ve been able to for the most part control it. But it has been an incredibly weird and interesting learning curve. Even though I broke up with her a year and a half ago, I am still vastly more emotional than I have been at any point in my life prior. Everything from movies to friendships to failure with women, etc., has caused some kind of emotional response whether it is something I can control or not. 

The last six months I’ve been back in the gym, picked up boxing, and studying/reading about a lot of topics. Just generally continuing my self improvement. Once again I have found myself upset at something I can no longer control. I finally set up a date to ask a woman out who I have known for over a year, just for that very same day to be the day she told me she is finally in a relationship again. There’s nothing I can do now, I missed my chance and anything other than supporting her would be wrong. 

This has prompted me to look into and begin studying stoicism. I dusted off a book a friend gave me several months ago called How to Be a Stoic: Using Ancient Philosophy to Live a Modern Life. I have been reading and taking notes. So far I have been extremely pleased with this ideology. I honestly think this is my solution and my framework for learning how to channel my old stoic behavior towards things of which I have no control while maintaining this newfound emotion for things in my control.

I’d greatly appreciate any help pointing me in the right direction regarding authors, books to read next, or any stoic philosophers that come to mind in my situation. I am very excited and hopeful that stoicism will help me reach what I am beginning to expect it can. Stoicism just seems like the perfect framework for balancing out my life. 

TLDR- For most of my life I was very stoic until a break up caused me to become quite emotional. After studying stoicism the little I have, I believe it can help me channel my stoic nature towards things changeable and my newfound emotion towards things I can change.",Stoicism,1703817065.0,t3_18tbvhg,0.82,17
"Running away from ""change"" but how to stop that in 2024 ?","

I'm not sure what the right phrase is like comfort zone, change, responsibilities, take life serious, take actions. I feel like I've been avoiding working on my life for almost 2 years now and now that 2024 is about to come in few days. The feeling of regret and shame is boiling down internally. I'm reflecting so much right to a point Im feeling overwhelmed and emotionally mentally exhausted. I realize my mistake and I don't blame nobody but me. I knew I was suppose to not let failures stop me but for years I just accepted it and live in this passive life mindset. I didn't have the guts or courage to stand up and make a change. I'm already in mid-20s but barely have any work experience besides fast food and retail store aka people call dead end jobs. My age group people have already some finished college, working in desired field jobs, in a relationship, overcoming fears, living in the adulthood independent life instead of staying with parents. Meanwhile I ask myself like what am I doing and when is my time gonna come in life. For how long am I gonna sit home scrolling phone and avoiding life. Sooner or later life is gonna slap me yet I'm already feeling all this all but I'm just not understanding why am I not taking action. Am I trying to avoid failure, wanting to be a perfectinism, scared to take action, face life sighs idk. If I don't help myself than nobody will.

Following my passion or following what my parents think is best for me.,"I (M,23, working class) hardly go out, I study at college (it's free here) and live in a developing country. I have friendships that are not really friendships since I hardly interact with them and I don’t have much in common, in reality I just have two true friends which I see seldom. My mother (F,41) says that I need to get out of my shell, wake up, go out more and I just realized that what I really like is art, which is a great coincidence; however, I am very clear that I want to dedicate myself to art and design, after drawing since childhood and coming up with stories, ideas and new narratives since childhood also and being part of an NGO and doing great things for the Marketing Department. I also decided I could look for groups with interests similar to mine. My mother, however, tells me that I have to look for other environments besides the one I want, to see how the real world is, and that I have to open up to other environments and that she can accommodate me in a job with my father where I can learn how to relate to other people, but that is not what I want at all, because I feel that I would be betraying myself and my ideals if I take that job. She is also looking for opportunities for me within her job, and says that I have to open up or else, I will be lost for many years like my father (M,41), who has been in the limbo of jobs he didn't like until he found a stable job (although, my father always wanted to be a full-time musician but wanted to find other jobs out of necessity cause he had a child, me, even though there were lots of opportunities as a musician). I have also worked for a Google Partner agency for some months but they fired me cause I couldn't meet the KPIs, and honestly, I didn't like that job and also had school and my volunteering at the NGO. That is my problem, choosing between dedicating myself to what I like fully or doing other things and leaving art and design as a hobby. As additional information, I have gone through diagnosed Generalized Anxiety which was crippling at the beginning but that over time it has lost power, and really in social environments I have trouble staying focused and I tend to be extroverted in some situations but according to my mother I do things that are not relevant or that are not socially acceptable (basically I lack social skills and everyone can step on me, as she says), such as asking an Uber driver politely if he can change the music being someone I just met today, or asking them (my parents) what they are talking about when I get to the table with them, that according to her. She also told me that I have to adapt to this society that is very superficial, in this developing Latin American country, since she lived it that way. Basically image sells way better than intelligence and competence, and she is saying about my attire and that I need to dress better, to which I agree. What can I do about it? What would be your advice? I understand that she wants the best for me and cares for me considering the situation in which we live in, but I just took a path I realized I didn't want once with my first degree, and lived in fear and pending for other people's approval for way too long (to which my mother disapproves because she says that if that was the case, I would be working on myself already).

Looking for the source of a quote by Marcus Aurelius,"I'm looking for the source of a quote about criticism. I believe its from Marcus Aurelius but I can't find it. I googled and found a reference to it here:

[https://dailystoic.com/how-to-not-be-afraid-of-criticism/#:\~:text=As%20Marcus%20Aurelius%20writes%2C%20if,and%20already%20be%20fixing%20it](https://dailystoic.com/how-to-not-be-afraid-of-criticism/#:~:text=As%20Marcus%20Aurelius%20writes%2C%20if,and%20already%20be%20fixing%20it)

>""As Marcus Aurelius writes, if that criticism is correct and we are in error then the person criticizing us has done us a favor by correcting it. If they are wrong, what do we care? More likely, if we are doing our job right, we should already be well aware of the issue that people are raising and already be fixing it.""

EDIT: Please... this is about the correct source of the quote and not about Ryan Holiday. IMHO quotes without specifying the source of the quotes are almost worthless because then you can't check the context of the quote.

But so far I was unable to locate this in the Meditations. I did find Meditations 5.3 which is similar but not the same:

>\[3\] Judge yourself entitled to say or do anything that’s in accord with nature, and don’t let yourself be talked out of it by any criticism or argument that may follow as a consequence. If it was the right thing to do or say, don’t put yourself down. Other people have their own command centers and their own impulses, and you shouldn’t let your attention be caught by them, but carry straight on,6 following your own nature and universal nature, two things that share a single path.

Epictetus Encheiridion 42 is similar:

>42. When someone acts badly towards you, or speaks badly of you, remember that he is acting or speaking in that way because he regards that as being the proper thing for him to do. Now, it isn’t possible for him to act in accordance with what seems right to you, but only with what seems right to him. So if he judges wrongly, he is the one who suffers the harm, since he is the one who has been deceived. For if anyone should think a true composite judgement\* to be false, the judgement itself isn’t harmed, but the person who has been deceived. If you start out, then, from this way of thinking, you’ll be gentle with someone who abuses you, for in each case you’ll say, ‘That is how it seemed to him.’

Can somebody please give me the source of the Marcus Aurelius quote (Meditations book/chapter) ? I don't want to use this like 'Somewhere in the internet I found that Ryan Holiday said that Marcus Aurelius said that,,,""

Thank you in advance.

Oh, BTW, if I'm incorrect and its not from Marcus Aurelius then I made a mistake and feel free to correct me, I will not be harmed :D",Stoicism,1703761895.0,t3_18srj8d,0.75,4
"Breaking the cycle, how?","Hey fellow stoics, I have some questions that I like to gain some insight in. Also, sorry for using a throwaway.

Some background about me. I have what I would consider a successful and fulfilled life. On the other hand I have always dealt with some mild level of anxiety, depression, perfectionism and self doubt. Not exactly to the point where I consider this clinically relevant but it's still annoying and probably the root cause of some of the issues I dealt with for years (if this is relevant I can go into details at a later point).
I have some formal (university level) training in philosophy and stumbled on stoicism a couple of years ago. I read Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and a couple of others.

So here is the issue: on a rational level all of stoicism makes perfect sense to me. I can subscribe to almost all if not all of the points, BUT... I feel like I struggle big time applying them to everyday life. How much varies by occasion but in general I blame this to my latent anxiety issues. I want to give two examples:

I have a rather annoying and difficult neighbour. This person is for some reasons, which I can partly empathize with (although I'm legally and morally in the right), angry at me and tries to make my life harder. To this date almost all of the stuff are minor incursions, making noise, minor insults, throwing rubbish over the fence in my garden now and then. Rationally I know perfectly well that I should ignore him, that I should just continue to live my life. This situation continues for half a year now and the agressions Come in waves. Whenever there is a new set I'm losing my composure and start spiraling into a fear hate anxiety thought spiral which wrecks my whole day. When I try to rationalise this there are still the physiological symptoms, heart beating, muscle tension etc. This immediately pulls me back.

Second example are certain interactions with my son. There are certain instances where his behaviour is triggering my rage and this is 100% out of that I love him and see that a certain behaviour in his future will probably hurt him and so I have to somehow deal with this. Whenever I throw a fit I immediately regret it because I realise how irrational this is. Also there mostly the physiological reactions suck me completely in and my rational brain shuts off.

Those are but two examples where I have a huge cognitive dissonance between how I know I should act correctly and how I actually react.

About things you cannot control,"I am new to this. What i understand is stoicism focuses on things you have control on, how to control things you can control. By default, humans are bad about distinguishing what they are in control of, and what they are not, and they are bad about actually controlling things they can control.

However, does stoicism promise to completely let go of things you cannot control, no matter how grim, exhausting and horrible they are? In the sub i noticed a frequent answer of ""Do you have control on it? If not, just go and focus on things you have control on"".

 To me its not realistic, to just not care and not be bothered by things you dont have control on. Similiar to be a buddist monk, to let go of earthly desires etc. Those who actually achieve that are born in temple culture and has no metropolian city problems in the first place. 

Maybe you can be bothered less, maybe you realize they are not that important to be bothered so much and let go, but can a hypotetical person John, who is cancer, is 4'5'' height adult male and in a third world country with a very toxic family, with no way out of his house, achieve to be not bothered by all this?

Thinking less extreme, i see its completely normal to be bothered by being unattractive for example. It is objectively hurting your social status especially dating. Maybe you are not absolutely doomed, but to simply say ""just focus on things you have control on"" sounds a shitty advice to be honest. ",Stoicism,1703760742.0,t3_18sr89r,0.62,3
How to best practice stoic values?,"In particular I’m having trouble letting go of that which I cannot control.

I had what I deemed the perfect life about a year ago.  I’d worked decades for it.  A turn of futures changed that early this year.

I’ve been doing therapy and reading a ton to try to overcome the trauma the change caused.  Yet it remains quite challenging for me to simply practice radical acceptance and be “happy” again with significantly less.

To elaborate, a year ago I was about to marry the love of my life with whom I was looking forward to starting a family shortly thereafter.  I’m 36 now.  We broke up in January over a personal tragedy of mine.  Now not only do I still have that personal tragedy to live with the rest of my life; I lost the woman I wanted to build a life with.  The personal tragedy left me with fewer prospects at a time in my life when I had already started feeling the pressure to start a family.

Struggling to radically accept my tragedy and my diminished prospects.  Even if rationally I can see that I have no control over the past and only reaction to it, I still struggle to no get down a year into it.

December’s Trials,"The month of December’s been a real test. In order of sequence.

* Mass Layoffs in my organization. I was forced to lay off 12 people on my team. About 70%.
* My cat of 12 years was diagnosed with lymphatic cancer. He died two weeks later in my arms when we euthanized him while he was starting to have congestive heart failure.
* We got a call my wife’s father was going to pass. Got on a 5 hour flight to a different country the next morning. He died 3 days later when we were in the room. Difficult scenario. Multiple religions. Multiple cultures. His burial wishes were odds with the family. I had to mediate between passionate people.
* Got a respiratory illness on the plane there, kicked into full gear by the time I flew back.
* Multiple hour plane delays.
* By Christmas Eve I got gastritis. Recovering now.

I had Stoicism by my side throughout. Quick reminders to calibrate me at the thousand moments throughout it all.

When my cat passed, I remember feeling grateful to have premeditated on this event for many years, never having lost an opportunity to enjoy him. Taking comfort in knowing I did my best to save him. And helped his passing when nothing else could. I’ll miss that little guy. But he’s been restored now.

When I was mediating a difficult family situation I anchored everything around what my proper role was in this family as a husband of a wife. A son-in-law. A guest.

When I got sick I recall being grateful for an opportunity to be reminded how nice it was to be absent of symptoms. There was one day I had a 7 hour migraine, pain piercing through all thoughts except a thought that I desired for things to be exactly as they were.

There were a thousand moments for Stoicism. A thousand reflections. It saved me from so many passions. But I won’t lie to you and pretend I was free from them.

When my cat passed, I was angry at the universe for about a day. In temporary disbelief, even though I witnessed his passing with my own eyes. I was inconsolable.

Now that I’m through it all. I have to admit I am exhausted. I would even go as far as saying I feel depressed. Like missing joi de vivre. Like the world lost some saturation in its colour. I cannot diagnose the cause for this, so I am giving it some time.

We go through these things because we have to. The only choice we have is in how we choose to take it on.

I recall Zeno’s story of the dog and the cart. I recall Marcus talking about what bearable pain is. I recall Epictetus and his many lessons about loss and one’s proper role. And envisioning how you’d like to maintain your character in adversity. I recall many of the people of this community, their insights and advice to others.

I began to implement many of the stoic teachings into my life and found mostly positive results.

However, recently I’ve started to get into conflicting philosophies, such as Machiavellianism and I have picked up books like Robert Greene’s 48 Laws of Power to supplement this interest. Through reading works like the 48 Laws of power, I came to a realization that it is nearly impossible to balance these 2 differing ideologies at once. Both these ways of thinking resonate with me in different ways, both being equally compelling. 

Has anyone else had a similar struggle to mine and what course of action is best suited to balance the teachings of multiple schools of thought?",Stoicism,1703726902.0,t3_18shcpf,0.5,0

Against Nature as Grounds for Compassion,"*  Musonius Rufus, like the other Stoics, advocated love for our fellow man. So then, what justification does Rufus give for compassion? He argues that compassion is in accordance with human nature. He justifies this by pointing to what we can observe in both human beings and bees, with both species cooperating with their own.
* My problem with this is that all kinds of things we would consider evil, such as rape and murder, are also part of human nature. Does that mean we must do those things too?
* Rufus would, I believe based on certain passages, counter this by saying things like rape and murder are hated and punished in all societies, at least within the boundaries of said societies (native American tribes would have no qualms about hurting members of other groups).
* The problem would be that this is a justification based on social consensus. It would be essentially saying ""Society approves it, therefore it is right"". And yet, there are things that societies past and present have approved of that are obviously immoral. Child sacrifice, female genital mutilation and ritual animal torture are things that have been or still are practiced and approved of under social consensus, and the reader of this message would most likely reject them with vehemence.
* Therefore we must conclude that nature, whether it be the nature of individual humans or the nature of society, is no grounds for compassion. ",Stoicism,1703699673.0,t3_18s6mnh,0.67,1

Emotional Repression w/Misapplication of Stoicism,"
u/SimonDK1994 brought up a very good point to my previous post: 

1.	⁠Make **S**ure to acknowledge your feel**i** n **g**s. People trying to practice stoicis**m** tend to surpress feelings before they learn th**a**t they should actually acknowledge them more and THEN deal with them rationally. This can lead to pinned up emotions and at some point send their world crashing down.(Ask me how i know)

I have been reflecting on it a lot more, and realize that I’ve actually been repre**s**sing my emotions *a lot* more than I thought. So I did more studying, and I’ve concluded the following: 

If there is a situation that ruffles me up, such as the train being delayed, I feel inpatient and angry. Because I’m trying to practice Stoicism, I usually would remind myself “Be calm, there’s nothing to be angry about.” This never actually wor**k**ed as **i** would *pretend* that I’m calm and **b** el **i**eve I was succee**di**ng, but inside I was reaching my boiling point. The issue here is that emotions are dependent variables, so we cannot simply say “Don’t be angry, there’s nothing to be angry about” as the anger has already been produced. If I want to not be angry, the anger has to genuinely not come in the first place. If it does, that is when we should reason to attempt calm ourselves down, not to pretend that we can just will our emotions away. Wait, is that what Epictetus meant when he said, 

“*For this reason also it is ridiculous to say, “Suggest something to me.” What should I suggest to you? “Well, form my mind so as to accommodate itself to any event.” Why that is just the same as if a man who is ignorant of letters should say, “Tell me what to write when any name is proposed to me.” For if I should tell him how to write Dion, and then another should come and propose to him not the name of Dion but that of Theon, what will be done? What will he write? But if you have practiced writing, you are also prepared to write anything that is required. If you are not, what can I now suggest? For if circumstances require something else, what will you say, or what will you do? Remember then this general precept and you will need no suggestion. But if you gape after externals, you must of necessity ramble up and down in obedience to the will of your master. And who is the master? He who has the power over the things which you seek to gain or try to avoid.*” - Discourse 2.2 “Of Tranquility from Pertubation”

If we injured our leg, it has already been injured, so just telling yourself to calm down is like telling someone to “just walk” on their injured leg.

So then we need to focus on the independent variable(s). Would that be our impressions? ",Stoicism,1703661595.0,t3_18rutqx,0.89,7

We were being sold a product, and made to feel we were not good enough for a specific institution. The stoic perspective says not to hold onto external opinions and that's correct. Yet I keep feeling this was an educated opinion. And why should I hold onto this? 

Why do we care about what institution one goes to? We shouldn't focus on the accolades or even the instructor but, on the lessons themselves. And that is all I'm taking with me going forward.",Stoicism,1703644914.0,t3_18rpnpx,0.62,2

Best book / text that talks about indifference,"Hi there, 

I have very little exposure to Stoicism, knowing only the basics. I have pretty sever OCD and intrusive thoughts and I have tried to deal with them through meds and talking therapy.

How would you proceed in my situation from a stoic point of view? Advice for dealing with a flaky friend,"A friend I considered close has disappointed me and out of curiosity I would like to hear how others may choose to act in this situation (from a stoic point of view).

A month ago I had a low point and messaged my friend if she could call me whenever she was free. No response.

A month passes and she completely ignores the message. I know she'd been out partying etc. At the very least she could've messaged me just to let me know she's a little busy and will catch up when she's available etc. out of respect. 

Additionally, I usually spend Christmas with her family because I'm in a foreign country and I've gotten close with them; they are always so caring and kind to me. Before this silent month, she had mentioned the invite from her parents again. But since ignoring my message she also never followed up on that invite or bothered checking on my Christmas plans etc. I also did not feel comfortable reaching out to inquire about coming over for Christmas since she hasn't even had the courtesy to open my message. 

Finally I receive a lame message from her on the 23rd about how she apparently didn't notice my message and that she's been busy working and fell ill on the week etc. 

I love her but I know she has tendencies to be...entitled and kind of unreliable. Not only with me but that's her core personality. She does what feels best to herself in the moment dealing with the consequences later. There's also been one other ongoing issue (nothing too serious but still enough for me to get annoyed and insecure) that I've tried to communicate to her but her behavior has not changed and I'm not sure I'm comfortable tolerating it anymore. 

I haven't bothered to respond to her message yet. I considered just ghosting her myself snd not talking to her again. Is that a bit too strong a reaction?",Stoicism,1703551315.0,t3_18qvdts,0.75,4

Life not going my way. People talking badly about me. How do I handle it?," 

Hello!

To give some context, I'm a medical student. I'm quite poor and racking up student loans, but I chose not to get a job because I cannot handle my school workload along with work. I have to say a lot of these medical students are quite wealthy, well connected and are related to doctors who can help them learn, show them resources and etc. I don't have any of that. I came from a poor immigrant family. I got discriminated by ethnicity and wealth. Now in med school, I'm somewhat struggling, not failing but not in a comfortable position in terms of grades and skills. Unbeknownst to some people med students can be some of the most toxic people you'll meet: Hypercompetitive, back stabbing, fake and etc. They constantly lie that their skills and grades and purely out of their natural intellect instead of admitting their connections and money helped (Some of my classmates will voluntarily say that they read the textbook but I later found out they don't and used outside studying material or they got jobs in the hospitals because their parents worked there and had connections, but refuse to acknowledge that; there was a pattern I noticed. In my city, it's currently hard to find a job right now and when I applied in the summer none hired me. The only classmates I knew who got hired were the ones who admitted their parents worked in the hospital.

Some of my classmates have been talking badly about me. Some of them have slandered me. I also have to fund my parent's retirement because they didn't save enough. At this point in life I kinda want to give up. I am disadvantaged, my classmates and even some of the unit nurses have talked badly about me. I deal with this regularly since I am in school or studying most of the time. I am not handling it well.

"""The beginning of philosophy ... is an awareness of one’s own weakness and incapacity when it comes to the most important things."" -- Epictetus","Kind of going back to basics on this one (from Discourses 2.11).  Came across this as I was reflecting on my struggles with letting go of past mistakes. 

Had a realization that it boiled down to my own arrogance as I looked back on my life.  I was holding my younger self to an unrealistic standard of perfection, that I *should* have thought and acted a certain way (given what I know now).  

Once I started accepting my own flawed nature as a typical human being, I could look back upon my earlier failures with more compassion and forgiveness.  With this came welcome sense of peace and relief.

As Ward Farnsworth puts it in The Practicing Stoic:

*Stoicism, as we have seen at many points, is a humble philosophy. It starts with candid assessment of one’s own flaws and foolishness. As the Stoic sees it, a confession of weakness is not weakness; it is the way to wisdom.*",Stoicism,1703453242.0,t3_18q4a2h,0.96,24

How would a stoic react to bullying?,"

Just graduated from high school, but the entirety of my last semester was spent being gaslit and bullied by one of the school’s favorite students. They promoted her as the most perfect person in the school so I felt like there was an ideal I could never measure up to as a boy, meanwhile she constantly mocked and belittled all of the boys in our class including me, but when I tried to tell the teachers about it she targeted me specifically.  She gaslit me into thinking I was some kind of monster she couldn’t feel safe around and I was scared to go into school most of the time. When I tried to talk to her about it, still thinking she was a good person, she got the teachers to shut me down entirely. Now I was not only being manipulated and bullied, but I couldn’t defend myself. Meanwhile the school, a Christian school btw, promoted her as the most perfect and Christ like student. She was one of their best athletes as well. The teachers refused to do anything about her and I ended up in some pretty disturbing patterns including potential suicide. I eventually came to find out that she was bullying everyone else too, but it was all completely permissible by the school. I don’t know what to make of my faith as a whole if that is what Christianity looks like. I’ve been in therapy for the past several months and I’ve been out of school entirely since may, but she is living in my head rent free and she will not leave.

Practice of stoicism or complacency?,"Lately, I have tried to speak up more in situation I don't like. I am naturally inclined towards making of the situation given to me, instead of trying to change it. The reason I started it was because I didn't want people to ""step over me"" at turns.

I am honestly torn between these 2 ideas:
1) The Original Way: Accept that everyone out there is playing a role in my growth and the burdens I am given are just tests that I must accept and deal with them.
2) The Other Way: Speak up, try to change the situation if given, but if it doesn't, then accept it.

I am a big fan of balance, and I think the 2nd approach helps to achieve that. Since I lean towards being complacent, I should try to be more vocal.

Applying principles in day to day life,"Hello, folks.

I have read about Stoicism for some time now, and am slowly but surely making my way through a number of books. My initial introduction was quite by accident when I encountered Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. This has also led me to read Letters from a Stoic - Seneca (I am not finished), and some of Epictetus (Discourse and selected writings. Translation,etc...by Robert Dobbin)

So much of this seems to make sense to me and I think there is real value in this philosophy. However, being so new to this, I am having difficulty in translating philosophy to concrete actions that I can take.  Amongst the most simplistic, but incredibly difficult for me to do is changing my mindset. For example, Epictetus states, “Man is disturbed not by things, but by the views he takes of them.”,and Marcus Aurelius states writes, ""Do not waste time on what you cannot control.”

What are concrete steps one can take in this direction? 

I have read the [Advice and Coping With Problems Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/wiki/advice/#wiki_advice_and_coping_with_problems), and again this makes sense when Epictetus wrote in Discourses that this takes time. (In answer to a man wanting a fig.) ""Let the tree blossom first, then put forth its fruit, and finally let the fruit ripen. Now although the fruit of even a fig-tree is not brought to perfection all at once and in a single hour, would you still seek to secure the fruit of a man's mind in so short a while and so easily?""

How does one even plant the seed of fig tree to begin with? 

* Are there concrete steps that one can take to plant the seed? 
* Once this seed is planted, are there concrete steps that one can take to build the mindset to manage how one views things?

Thank you for your advice and allowing me a moment of your valuable time!

Senecas view on frequent travel,"Hi everyone! I just started reading ""Letters from a Stoic"" by Seneca. In Letter II of the book, Seneca states the following:  
""To be everywhere is to be nowhere. People who spend their whole life travelling abroad end up having plenty of places where they can find hospitality but not real friendships"".

I wanted to pose an argument to this statement. I am hoping to have others chime in with their own view / a response that may have been expected from a person like Seneca:  


Is it necessary to be somewhere? I argue that the brief and admittedly capricious interactions with other travellers and locals often exceeds the knowledge and wisdom that is to be gained at home. If I prioritised a friendship at home at the expense of gaining new cultural perspectives or wisdom from people I meet abroad, would I not be prioritising a passion over wisdom? Could the desire to form friendships not be interpreted as exactly that, a passion? Wisdom is a virtue part of the true good. Would it not by necessity be more valuable to seek out wisdom that is not otherwise to be gained at home, at the expense of lasting friendships? Sure, wisdom and new cultural experiences can be gained at home, but there is an air of complacency with lasting friendships that do not stimulate new perspectives the same way that frequent travel abroad does.   


I would love to hear your opinion and perspective! I would love to be made aware if I have misinterpreted something as well. Thanks!",Stoicism,1703387116.0,t3_18pm0fq,0.56,2

Now I’m thinking a stoic would probably tell me that we need to control our good too, as moderation is usually key. But then what’s left? Do we need some sort of balance because we can’t let go of our control of the good, because this will ultimately lead to back to the bad (e.g. maximizing joy in the moment, which leads to short term satisfaction but results in long term negative consequences (additional e.g. impulsive, reckless behavior)).

Questions about humanity and passions,"Hello there! Im new here since i just saw Stoicism in school, lol. Now, it was quite an interesting philosophy! I like it :D

But i have some questions:

Mrs Teacher told us that stoics must control their passions and use reason instead, so that way they act in a wise way. Passions arent necesarilly bad, some are good, others bad and other regular. But thats why they need to be kept under control.  If people get carried away by their passions, they dont act in a reasonable way and only cause more damage. I asked Mrs Teacher how much damage, she said ""Greed, war, hatred, etc.""

And i was like HOLY COW. 

1 - Passions really damage so much? The reason of why there is so much hatred, racism, war, greed and more, is because that most humans are passional beings and not rational beings?

2 - Also, how are we supposed to control our passions?

3 - If we somehow made that education promoted reasoning and all humanity became rational instead of passionae, how much better would the world be?

Finding meaning in life,"Stoicism has already helped me in becoming a better person. I can focus better on my studies, I go to the gym regularly now. When I have a hard time getting out of bed, I think about, what Marcus Aurelius said in Meditations:

>>At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: “I have to go to work — as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for — the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?”
So you were born to feel “nice”? Instead of doing things and experiencing them? Don’t you see the plants, the birds, the ants and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks, putting the world in order, as best they can? And you’re not willing to do your job as a human being? Why aren’t you running to do what your nature demands?
You don’t love yourself enough. Or you’d love your nature too, and what it demands of you.<<

But right now, I really struggle with finding any meaning in life. I feel depressed almost every evening because I'm thinking ""What am I doing all this for?""

How Stoicism is helping me stay alive (from suicidal ideation),"Even if I can never truly be considered a Stoic, I am determined to try my best to become as close as I can to it. For some quick background; I’ve grown up in poverty, suffered years as a child through sexual abuse, I’ve attempted suicide near the beginning of the year and have been admitted to the mental hospital 4 times this year, lost my job, evicted, cheated on (after 4.5 years) - ending my first relationship, lost all of my friends, kicked out of college etc. I am not attempting to elicit sympathy. I see suicide brought up quite often in the subreddit, so I am trying to offer my assistance. As of such, please correct me if I am misapplying and/or misinterpreting any of the ideas. 

**1. Virtue: COURAGE**
Life is feeling quite uncomfortable at the moment; Just as I believe it can’t get any worse, it just keeps throwing more and more surprises my way. Although I am working to *change* my outlook on life, my current belief is that life will not get better and I will just experience more suffering. I *suppose* that this isn’t true, but I genuinely do not believe its falsehood - **yet**. By practicing the virtue of courage I am accepting that fact and living *in spite* of that belief. As corny as it sounds: it takes courage to live. Courage is not living in the absence of fear, but to live *despite* those fears and discomforts. 

Another aspect of courage is *actually seeking professional help*, and having the courage to put my faith in these professionals’ hands. It was hard as I had ZERO faith that it would work, but lemme tell ya, **it’s working**. 

**2. Epictetus, Discourse 1.18 “That we ought not to be angry with the errors (faults) of others”**

 “*Learn that a thief and an adulterer have no place in the things which are yours, but in those which belong to others and which are not in your power. If you dismiss these things and consider them as nothing, with whom are you still angry? But so long as you value these things, be angry with yourself rather than with the thief and the adulterer.*” 

I use this concept to cope with 1: The infidelity and 2: The years of sexual abuse I’ve been through. Regarding the infidelity, their loyalty is exactly that: *their* loyalty, meaning it is theirs to give and theirs to take back whenever they please. Even if they agreed to give it to me, nothing hinders them from betraying that agreement. In this case, they have chosen to take it back, and therefore have communicated this to me through their actions. At that point, it’s up to me to decide how I respond to what they’ve communicated - we are no longer together. The decision to end it is not about hating or resenting them. If the only thing in my power is the right use of appearances, then I’ve concluded the following: It’s because I want loyalty. They’ve proven to be an unreliable source for that, and therefore it would be senseless to desire something from someone that they’ve *proven* to be unable to provide. 

**3. Epictetus as an example**
I mean come on, Epictetus has been through some awful ass shit. He is an amazing example of Stoicism at work. I have trouble following advice if the person giving the advice *only* knows the answers through theory as opposed to practical application. Epictetus completely blows that out of the water for me. If HE can do it, surely I can. 

**4. Epictetus, Discourse 1.24 “How we should struggle with circumstances”** in combination with **Discourse 1.5 “Against the Academics”**

“*It is circumstances (difficulties) which show what men are. Therefore when a difficulty falls upon you, remember that God, like a trainer of wrestlers, has matched you with a rough young man. “For what purpose?” You may say. Why, that you may become an Olympic conquerer; but it is not accomplished without sweat.*” 

“*But, you may say, there are some things disagreeable and troublesome in life. And are there none at Olympia? Are you not without comfortable means of bathing? Are you not wet when it rains? Have you not abundance of noise, clamour, and other disagreeable things? But I suppose that setting all these things off against the magnificence of the spectacle, you bear and endure. Well then and have you not received faculties by which you will be able to bear all that happens? Have you not received greatness of the soul? Have you not received manliness? Have you not received endurance? And why do I trouble myself about anything that can happen if I possess greatness of the soul? What shall distract my mind or disturb me, or appear painful? Shall I not use the power for the purposes for which I received it, and shall I grieve and lament over what happens?*” 

I have been given the faculties to deal with everything that has happened to me and everything that *can* happen to me. With that in mind, I have the knowledge that by using such faculties I am making them stronger and therefore becoming stronger myself. This, if anything, takes me RIGHT out of my suicidal episodes. Yes, the things that have happened may seem horrible, but I’ve *endured* them and grown from them. It’s like; yeah, that’s a big ass mountain, but I **climbed** that big ass mountain. THAT is what’s important. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHJHHH",Stoicism,1703303940.0,t3_18ox2tm,0.89,39
Opinion required regarding action upon urges,"This post is somewhat inspired by a post I've seen earlier regarding sexual urges and masturbation and I've gained several thinking points from the comments there. Thus i want to ask your opinion on some issues I face.

Whenever I've acted upon my sexual urges ( be it masturbation or watching content regarding that) i feel like i have wasted the day and what ever productive thing i do or new ideas i think of on that day will result in failure down the line. Its like i have marked that day as a bad omen or something.

 I know it sounds childish but I  battle everyday with myself against obsessive intrusive thoughts,ocd and procrastination. So any pointers you can provide will only help me in that fight.

I care too much about what others think of me.,"I (19F) have found myself to become increasingly overly concerned with how others perceive me and what their opinions of me are. I don't know how keep these concerns at bay. I am plagued by this fear of others disliking me or talking bad about me behind my back so much that I spend a considerable amount of time thinking about it. I am either thinking about what exactly about my personality is so off-putting or I am thinking about how I can manufacture a false personality to make myself more laid back and appealing.

A week ago, my best friend and his family, both of which I am very close to, invited me over for dinner and this wasn't the first time that this invitation was extended to me. My best friend's brother has a new girlfriend who showed up to this dinner and although me and her had barely exchanged any words beyond a hello, it was disclosed to me that this person does not like me for whatever reason. I am so confused and my mind does cartwheels trying to figure out what I did wrong when I do my best to be personable and kind to those around me. I know this is unhealthy and I shouldn't be so wrapped up in this but I can't help it. I don't know if I even like this person and there's a likely chance my friend's brother and his girlfriend will break up in due time yet I still care too much. Heck, I don't even know when's the next time I will be in the same room as this person.

This little incident is just one example of many where information was revealed to me about or I had found out by myself that a person who I thought I was cool with no longer approves of me and it's always something stupid and simple like people unfollowing me on social media, being quiet and shut down when I enter a room, ex-friends finding excuses to leave me out of plans and hang-outs, etc, etc. I understand to many, I have a strong personality, I have a bit of a potty mouth and my sense of humor is out there but never offensive and I don't let my jokes run wild around people I have just met who might not know better. These thoughts then extend to me feeling like the least favorite of every friend group or just overall an unimpressive and forgettable friend.

How do I let go of these thoughts and this pressure I put on myself to be as likable as possible to everyone I know? I always feel inadequate. I am new to stoicism and would like to put some stoic practices in my day-to-day but I am unsure of what the appropriate  response to all this is as I feel like me getting so wrapped up in my head isn't very ""stoic"".",Stoicism,1703298503.0,t3_18ovhbg,1.0,10
My social skills are terrible,"Hello, M17 here. I'm not exactly sure how to begin explaining my situation but i'll give it my best. I've always been a very quiet person, but thing is i don't think i'm a so called ""introvert"". I want to talk to people, i like it, it makes me happy to socialize with friends but the problem is i cant. I don't know how to i guess. I'm scared to talk to strangers, though this has gotten better over the last couple of years after i've convinced myself that not everyone is negatively judging me 24/7, but my stubborness of talking to strangers is somewhat still there. And to get to the main issue, I don't know how to talk, even to people i know! I simply don't know what to say when i'm talking to somone, and so when for example i'm in a group of three, i'll just end up being next to the other two listening what they say and not contributing anything to the conversation. I try to think of something to say but nothing comes out and as i've said before, i simply don't know what to say.
I'm not sure why i'm like this, but my guess is how i grew up perhaps? When i was 4 y/o me and my mom moved to a completely new country. My mother did not know a word on the language. I don't remember much of when i started school, but i do remember i did not have friends, and this was probably in 1st grade. So really i've never had many friends either. Today i only have one truely good friend whom i am able to talk to. But as i've said, when someone else joins us, i am unable to speak, yet my friend has no problems...
I even joined my local volleyball team (because i like the sport) and I would say i'm somewhat friends with like two guys, but even then we don't hang out after practice except video games. I want to be able to join them talk after practice, but i just end up looking at them.
I'm just lost at what i should do, how can i learn to talk?

TL;DR I don't know how to speak, I want to talk but whenever i try, nothing comes out of my mouth and my mind is empty.",Stoicism,1703293175.0,t3_18otskl,0.88,12
What are some good Stoic texts related to righteous indignation and not feeling anger and outrage when something doesn’t go my way?,"So I noticed I have this pattern where I get very angry when something doesn’t go my way. It feels like some great injustice has been done to me.

Rather than seeing it from a more objective perspective where it’s just a slight preference, that didn’t go my way, I get all bent out of shape and feel like it shouldn’t have gone that way, and things need to have gone differently, and I oftentimes get angry during these situations.

I’m looking for a way to change this behavior and be able to remain more levelheaded both in my behaviors outwardly, but also more importantly, in my inward feelings, as well.

I’m wondering if anyone has any stoic texts that they could recommend to me to help in this area?

Created a Self-Study Introductory Course on Stoicism,"I started reading “Daily Stoic” about a year ago, and really enjoy that is is mostly just quotes from original texts of the Stoic Philosophers. I do not really like Ryan Holiday or his anecdotes. Sometimes they are helpful for understanding the passage, but more often than not they seem pointless. So I wanted to read a mix here of modern stoic authors, while also reading some of the  primary texts. I used ChatGPT to come up with parts of this syllabus, but the texts and resources chosen are my own. Is this a good staring point? 

Course Title: Stoicism: An Exploration of Ancient Wisdom for Modern Living

Course Description:
This self-study course on Stoicism delves into the timeless principles of this ancient philosophy, providing students with a comprehensive understanding of Stoic thought and its application in contemporary life. Spanning across three credits, this course invites students on a transformative journey that combines introspection, critical analysis, and practical exercises to cultivate resilience, wisdom, and emotional well-being.
Through a carefully curated selection of texts, including the seminal works of Stoic philosophers such as Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius, students will explore the core tenets of Stoicism. They will gain practical insights into leading a life characterized by virtue, tranquility, and the pursuit of personal excellence, regardless of external circumstances.
This self-study course encourages students to actively engage with Stoic principles through a variety of mediums, including readings, video lectures, reflective journaling, and guided exercises. By fostering a sense of personal responsibility, this course empowers students to develop actionable strategies for adopting Stoic principles into their own lives.

Key areas of exploration in this course include:
1. The Stoic Mindset: Students will develop an understanding of the Stoic worldview, exploring key concepts such as virtue, nature, and personal discipline. They will examine Stoic teachings on the importance of personal choice, resilience in the face of adversity, and maintaining a focused and rational mind.
2. Emotion and Rationality: Drawing on Stoic insights, students will explore the nature of emotions and how to cultivate emotional well-being through the practice of rational thinking. They will learn to observe and evaluate their own emotional responses, gaining tools to transform negative emotions into opportunities for growth, wisdom, and tranquility.
3. The Art of Acceptance: Stoicism emphasizes accepting and embracing the realities outside of our control, enabling individuals to find peace in the face of life's uncertainties. Students will examine the Stoic concept of indifference to external events and develop strategies to manage stress, overcome obstacles, and live authentically.
4. Relationships and Virtue: Stoicism places a strong emphasis on cultivating virtuous relationships. Students will explore Stoic teachings on friendship, justice, and our responsibilities towards others. They will examine how Stoic ethics can transform their approach to social interactions, enabling them to foster healthier, more meaningful relationships.
5. Stoicism in the Modern World: Applying Stoic teachings to contemporary contexts, students will explore how Stoic philosophy can inform and enhance various aspects of their lives, including career, personal goals, and decision-making. They will analyze real-world examples and case studies, equipping them with practical tools to navigate the challenges of modern life with wisdom and equanimity.

Stoics Against Social Isolation,"I would like to discuss the stoic application of social interaction. This is in response to the frequent posts that go something like ""Due to x,y,z circumstances and events, I've decided that I'm never talking to anyone ever again, how can stoicism help me with the inevitable psychological consequences of my self-induced solitary confinement?""

I understand how someone could get an idea of the story of Seneca the Younger and him being wrongfully exiled, and I appreciate how well this story helps convey important tenants of stoicism, but I feel people run with the idea that stoicism = being alone. I also understand that Stoicism has been adopted by the ""sigma grindset"" side of social media that primarily values productivity and material success or status, which likely sends a lot of people here.

There is a concept of Oikiosis that's mostly discussed and referenced from the very early stoics like Cicero, but it's nonetheless important. My understanding of oikiosis is that it's the individual's natural instinct for self-preservation and care which extends outwards to friends and community, that helps develop an individual's moral compass. Moreover, the cardinal stoic virtue of justice does not only call for the fair treatment of others but also active contribution to the community, and this seems to be overlooked.

**In short,** if someone is dealing with a tragedy that has left them completely socially isolated, stoicism can help, but I believe, from my interpretation of the texts, that it's antithetical to stoicism to completely remove oneself from all communities. Thoughts?

**Some sources:**

""With the exception of wisdom, I'm inclined to believe that the immortal gods have given nothing better to humanity than friendship."" - Cicero

""No good thing is pleasant to possess, without friends to share it."" - Seneca

""Friendship produces between us a partnership in all our interests. There is no such thing as good or bad fortune for the individual; we live in common. And no one can live happily who has regard to himself alone and transforms everything into a question of his own utility; you must live for your neighbour, if you would live for yourself. "" - Seneca

""This is the first promise that philosophy holds out to us: fellow-feeling, humanity, sociability."" — Seneca

""Nature bore us related to one another … She instilled in us a mutual love and made us compatible … Let us hold everything in common; we stem from a common source. Our fellowship is very similar to an arch of stones, which would fall apart, if they did not reciprocally support each other"" - Seneca",Stoicism,1703274255.0,t3_18on6um,0.89,7

Does anyone else get massively dissapointed in themselves when they react based off emotion? How do you deal with that?,"Hi everyone,

How do you guys deal with reacting based off emotion?

 Lately I have been having kinda shitty days (I know this isnt an excuse) and I just sometimes do things that I very am dissapointed in.

For example just today when I was cycling back from the gym I see a family standing in the middle of the cycling lane like dumbasses. Now here's the bit im dissapointed in,  I gave the guy (I assume the dad) kinda like a death stare. Not a massive big deal I know but still.

What good does that do? Nothing. Will that prevent them from doing that again? Probably not. Will I get my ass beat if I do that to the wrong guy? Possibly. Maybe they didnt even know that they were on a cycling lane.  I immidietly after that was so dissapointed in myself. Like dude are you a baby?

I know that I am in control of my own actions/reactions. I cant control what others do or say. Some people are just not very thoughtful,(?) of others. Not everyone has the same norms and values. Maybe they were even new to the country and dont even know how the traffic rules work. I should pity them and not react in a hateful manner. But sometimes its just so grrrr, you know?

How do you guys ""catch"" yourself before reacting? I always have the stoic mindset after the fact.",Stoicism,1703270607.0,t3_18olvqw,0.96,68

Understanding my own meditations,"I am fairy new to Stoicism I have been trying to write out conversations I have in my head in order to better understand myself and my emotions. I'm hoping with my recent studies of Stoicism, I am able to apply the values into my thoughts. I'd love to hear any feedback or to add some Stoic wisdom to better relate to yourself.

Why am I such an emotionally sensitive individual?

It feels like I don’t know how to take anything as a joke anymore. I used to brush everything off and laugh about it, but now I don’t know how to respond. 

No one is truly joking about anything they say. There is always some sense of truth behind their words. 

\- But people do joke, you have just been accustomed to bullying.

“I don’t see much you bring to the table other than constant sensitivity”

\- See? Bully.

Why cant a man be emotional without being ridiculed? Humans are designed to have emotion, it’s what allows you to express your soul. Men are told to remain unobstructed by any of life's mishaps. 

\- Correct. You must still allow yourself to process your own emotional reactivity to the thoughts following a specific event. 

Yes; however, we are still ridiculed for our emotions. The insecurities of others leaks out of them as they bark at  you for being able to be honest and open with yourself and your emotions. 

\- Then leave them as they were. Their thoughts and emotions don't pertain to you.  ",Stoicism,1703212842.0,t3_18o4hab,0.99,1

How to stop hating somebody and be stoic?,"Had an ugly falling out with a ""friend"" about nine months ago.  (He accused me of doing something I didn't do, and refused to accept my explanation.)

My hatred of him was infinite for awhile, and thankfully it's gotten at least a little better in recent weeks.  But plenty of hatred remains.

What's still holding me back from letting go completely?  I still have to see this person every week, because he works at a restaurant my husband & I frequent.  Obviously we aren't going to boycott the restaurant over this, but I do look forward to the day that he no longer works there.

Of the people I've actually known, my list of folks I absolutely loathe isn't very long:  An ex-boss, my brother, and the devil incarnate kid who came up from behind me when I was six years old and shoved my head into a tire rim just because.  Fortunately I no longer have to see any of them, so they (mostly) stay out of mind because they're far out of sight.

But I still have some rage when I encounter the jerk at the restaurant.  I wish nothing but bad things for him -- which isn't stoic, and I'm not proud of it.  I think my continued anger stems from the fact that at the time of kerfuffle, I could have really let him have it and told him off.  I didn't, and now it's too late.

Maybe the fact that I didn't tell him off was a form of stoicism?  I don't know.  But I'm really curious how some of you get so stoic that you can 100% tune out someone you despise, when that person is sometimes just a few feet away from you.  How do you do it?",Stoicism,1703207744.0,t3_18o2tqp,0.84,16
does any one follow the message of stoics as to think before going through with your behaviour?,"I have been reading **Art of Living** an interpretation of Epictetus lesson by Sharon Lebell.

anyways in one of the lessons the author says that before doing any course of action i should think before doing it.

i think this is a great advice and for some it's common sense but does anyone do it? i'm not saying nobody does it i'm genuinely curious cause it seems like it's so time consuming because we make more 1000 decision a day and more than 1000 action so thinking before doing anything omg that would be soul killing.

that's my opinion i know my knowledge is limited and i'm here to learn i asked because i want to learn i'm young and foolish so be easy on me please.

ps: i'm asking because i want to understand this lesson better cause throught my whole life i always said and done stupid things especially (the problem of saying stupid things and doing them only occurs when i'm around my family and that makes me so sad idk why really i really love my family and respect them.) when i'm around my family, said things i regret saying and doing. so i think this lesson if done correctly and practiced could help make me a better person. and i don't know why i'm so foolish around my family. but it is what it is.

"Successful reframing of ""negative"" emotional reactions.","Ive recently had a light bulb moment regarding negative emotional reactions. 

A year ago I became aware of the childhood emotional neglect I faced growing up. I was completely burnt out and was unable to function at the caliber I had become accustomed to and expected from myself. This lead me to discovering CPTSD, followed by Stoicism. I'm sure the emotional neglect contributed to my negative emotional reactions, so this might seem more obvious to some.

Over the last year I would seem to grasp the Stoic philosophy, taking control over my negative emotional reactions but then a particular hardship would come along and trigger me, and make my understanding and practice of Stoicism become muddled and confusing. 

If someone was taking advantage of me or if someone was criticizing me unfairly I would become upset. I would try to work through this by telling myself ""don't worry about things that are out of my control"", ""how I respond is what's important, not what someone does"", ""judge myself on how I'm acting, don't project my morals onto others"", ""be kind to them, they are not intending to be mean, they're just ignorant"". Etc etc. Despite reading and reminding myself of Stoic philosophy, after each challenging situation I would still be upset inside. I was still feeling upset by the actions of others. I didn't know how to truly believe something that I didnt like, wasn't a negative. I also felt complacent, as if I wasn't standing up for myself in these situations. I couldn't make it all come together neatly and calmly in my mind and my gut. 

But then it hit me. How I'm viewing the hardship/unfavorable action is all wrong. I had been trying to deflect my negative reactions by looking inward for comfort, when I should have been looking inward to change my perspective. 

Below I've outlined 2 examples of my reframing and what response it yields. 

""Someone is taking advantage of me"" becomes ""someone is doing something I don't like"". Instead of having a negative emotional reaction to being taken advantage of, I now have the option to simply and matter of fact-ly communicate my needs and expectations or remove myself from the situation. Saying I am being taken advantage of is a judgement/assumption I am making of their behaviour/intention, and it makes me a victim. That's a tough pill to swallow. It comes from my own expectations of how others should act, it comes from my ego. Removing the judgement statement makes it much easier for me to respond rationally. 

""Someone is judging/criticizing me"" becomes ""i dont agree with someone's opinion of me"". Again, instead of viewing myself negatively through their eyes, which causes me to become defensive, I am simply saying we disagree on the topic, that their truth isn't THE truth. I can either express my views in a virtuous manner, agree to disagree, or consider their perspective and aim to improve if needed. My internal dialog switched from labeling myself as the problem, to labeling the problem as the problem. 

I would love hear more ""negative emotional reactions/judgements = neutral statement replacement"" that others can think of!",Stoicism,1703199062.0,t3_18nzowk,0.99,16

Purity of the Daily Stoic?,"I (like many, I assume) found Stoicism through Ryan Holiday. It resonates with me as he presents it. But, I've not yet done my own deep dives into source material.

Loving Evil People," Reading The Meditations, Marcus Aurelius says that the height of all logic that all stoics should seek out is loving every last human being. I have been contemplating this for a few weeks but keep coming to a dead end... I have felt freed by loving those who are condescending or mean to me instead of stewing in my own damaged ego or pride. However, I don't understand how I can possibly love someone like Hitler or Leopold II or other people like them who are undoubtedly horrific monsters. I understand that people are a product of their environment, but at a certain point you are making a willing choice to continue down a path of moral corruption. I can have faith that people can change, but many people (like Hitler and Leopold) will never change. How and why is it important to love those who spread hatred and death?

Eternal Return and Free Will.,"Hi!
I found the concept of Eternal Return which was practiced by Stoics, especially the earliest ones. I have got a question. 
So, according to the theory of eternal return, time is cyclical, it repeats itself and according to some posts I've seen here, it all happens over again, the same way it was before, so I understood that if there is a Glad_Communications posting this today, there was another Glad_Communications in the past cycle and there will be another one in the future cycles. And as far as my studies in Stoicism work, then nature is deterministic, which means that there are things which will inevitably happen, but we have some degree of free will according to the knowledge we have and will have, so... in that way, isn't then determinism and eternal return mutually exclusive? Because nature then would then be pre-deterministic.",Stoicism,1703177066.0,t3_18nraab,0.67,2

“My soul, will you ever be good, simple, individual, bare, brighter than the body that covers you? Will you ever taste the disposition to love and affection? Will you ever be complete and free of need, missing nothing, desiring nothing live or lifeless for the enjoyment of pleasure?”

Can someone explain this to me in a better way than I’m currently understanding it? It seems to me like there should be no enjoyment or emotion in life other than virtue.

I just got fired,"My life couldn’t get any more unfortunate lol.

I missed a shift a few weeks ago because of a technical error that didn’t notify me that I was scheduled for that day. My supervisor notified me of this and I assured her it wouldn’t happen again but there was literally no way I could have prevented this.

Fast foward to a couple weeks later and I’m scheduled for a shift that conflicts with my unavailability (another technical issue). On the day before my shift starts (2 hours in advance) I let my supervisor know that I won’t be able to attend because of a competition. She responds 4 hours later and because of competition rules, I can’t use my phone and respond to her in a timely manner. I see her message a few hours later asking me to come in late but I see that it’s past the time of the shift. Here’s where I know I messed up- I eventually end up not followingup with her as I believe it would be better just to leave things as is since I thought the situation was under control.

I message her a few days after that regarding a question and everything seems cool, no mention of any issues regarding the whole situation or anything like that. Then, I receive an email on Monday saying that I’m being terminated for my low availability (this was the topic of the question i messaged to her) and that I’ve had two no-shows with little communication.

I feel like I properly communicated for the first one and I see my mistake in the second but I just can’t help but feel a bit distraught. I genuinely thought everything was fine and it feels like a bomb has been dropped on me.

Stressed about money and future and status and happiness,"NOTE: I have ADHD and Crohn's, which I think influences why I feel this way. I'm posting here because I've found Stoicism helpful in the past and I think people here will have a unique perspective on this. 

&#x200B;

I naturally stay up late and wake up late. When I don't have external demands on me, I tend to sleep between 2am and 4am and wake up between 10am and 1pm. 

Obviously, when I was in school, I had to be there from 8-4 ish every day (well, excluding the large amount of days I skipped or left at lunch or showed up after lunch). I honestly can't remember how I did it. I think I was usually just groggy and annoyed for a few hours and then felt better as the day went on. 

After college, I tried to work various jobs that started in the morning, around 8 or 9. I quit all of them relatively quickly because I just hated getting up so early. I hated feeling rushed. I hated not having time to eat breakfast or have coffee or tea. I hated driving to work in rush hour traffic. 

After a couple years I went to Korea to teach in an afterschool English academy. My hours were 3pm-10pm ish. It was awesome. I'd get up, enjoy my morning, go for a hike or something, eat lunch, and head to class feeling good. My job was fun and I was good at it. Then I'd relax at night or walk around or whatever I wanted and just go to sleep when I felt tired. 

The problem is as I'm getting older I'm a bit stressed about money and the future and all that stuff. My job in Korea provided a free apartment, but the salary wasn't much. I could save a few hundred dollars a month if I tried. I came back to the US after 2 years with about 4 grand. 

I applied to a bunch of jobs in the US. The two interviews I got were car salesman (which sounded terrible and would have me working like 10 hours a day) and concessions at the movie theater (which I took and I'm enjoying, but obviously the money is very little). 

I've thought about ways I could make more money and I basically came up with 3 options. 

1) Do something online like writing or making videos or learning to code- This would be good because of flexibility, but it's hard to predict whether you will be successful. Also, I tend to get down if I don't socialize for awhile. I get energy from being around people and I don't know if I could be happy sitting in my room for 8 hours a day. 

2) Become a ""real"" teacher- This would require me to get a teaching license and/or masters degree. I could potentially end up working in international schools, which sounds cool. They also get paid a lot better than academy teachers. But from what I've heard, you generally have to spend 2 years teaching in the US or an undesirable country before you get a job somewhere I'd want to live. I really don't want to do that. And honestly, I don't want to go back to the school schedule, waking up at 6 or 7am. And I don't want to teach big classes, like 30-40 kids. The max at my old job was 12 and even that felt a bit much to me. 

3) Go to law school- I did well in debate, majored in philosophy, and got a good score on a practice LSAT. I think I have the skills to excel in this. But working as a lawyer requires a 9-5 type job (or worse if you want to make a lot of money). And also I think a lot of it will be boring and tedious and ethically grey, which I don't like. When I think about it, I did well in debate, but it also stressed me out a lot and I could get mad when judges were stupid or people were mean to me. 

&#x200B;

So, as you can see, I have no idea what to do next haha. I think two of the biggest things holding me back are not wanting to work a ""normal"" schedule or live in places I don't want to live in. To be honest, what I want to do is go back to working in an academy in Korea. I think I was the happiest I've ever been there and I miss it. But I'm scared of not making much money as I get older. 

I don't really care much about money myself. I really wish I didn't have to think about it. I kind of hate thinking about it. But it's important for security, in case of emergencies or what not. And I'm worried about my ability to date or get married as I get older if I don't start making more money. Most girls I dated in my 20's didn't seem to care, but will they if I'm in my 30s and still not making a lot? 

Anyone relate to this or have any advice? 

My dad wants me to go to law school and I think my mom wants me to get a masters in education, but I think I might end up hating either one. I want to go back to teaching in an academy, but I'm worried and feel I might be embarrassed to still be doing that in my 30s. I turn 30 in October.

How would stoics view modernity?,"
Modern day hook up culture plaguing the youth, wide spread availability of drugs, instant pleasure at our finger tips, no real commitments to anything, hyper active behavior everywhere, no real search for meaning, feminization of men, wide spread obesity, being a father or mother is seen as a ""waste"", lust and greed driven, etc...

I could go on with hundreds more but you clearly get the picture.

Before you say, ""that's a minority group and your spending to much time on social media...🤓"" I agree it is a minority, however, I lump it all together to create what I would consider a small majority group, or at least maybe that's where it's heading.

I dont really consume any social media and I'm not some old guy behind the times. I'm really young and I just like philosiphy.

So back to the question:

How would stoics, like Marcus Aurelius or Seneca, view our society today? Is it much different than theirs at the time? Also, what would they say to us in regards to how we should live, or what we can do to change?

Is this Stoicism?,"I read a book by the famous historical polymath ibn Hazm and something in my mind says its stoic.

He wrote:

""These words encapsulate all 
virtue: to control oneself against passion means in fact to turn 
away from one’s natural tendency towards anger and lust, 
things which are both under the dictates of passion. Then all 
that is left for the soul to use is the intellect which God has 
given it, the good sense which distinguishes it from the beasts, 
from insects or vermin and from tigers. “Never lose your 
temper,” as Allah’s Prophet (peace be upon him) said to a 120
man asking advice, and, as he also said commanding him, “Do 
as you would be done by” , together encapsulate the whole of 121
virtue


He further writes about the goal of all humans and all nations, 
“I have tried to find one goal which everyone would agree to be 
excellent and worthy of being striven after. I have found one 
only: to be free from anxiety. When I reflected upon it, I 
realized that not only do all agree in valuing it and desiring it, 
but I also perceived that, despite their many different passions 
and aspirations and preoccupations and desires, they never 
make the slightest gesture unless it is designed to drive anxiety 
far away. One man loses his way, another comes close to going 
wrong, finally another is successful - but he is a rare man, and 
success is rare, (O all-knowing Allah). Dispelling anxiety is a 
goal upon which all nations agree from the time when the 
Almighty created the world until the day when this world will 
pass away and be followed by the Day of Judgment - and their 
actions are directed to this goal alone. In the case of every 
other objective there will always be some people who do not 
desire it. For example, some people are not religious and do 
not take eternity into account. There are some who by nature 
and inclination prefer obscurity to fame [the obscurity of 
satisfied passion]. There are some who have no interest in 
amassing a fortune, preferring abstinence to ownership; this 
was the case with many of the Prophets. May peace be upon 
them all - and those who followed their example, ascetics and 
philosophers. There are some who by nature dislike sensual 
pleasures and scorn those who seek after them, such as those 
men we have just mentioned, and who prefer to lose a fortune 
rather than gain one. Some prefer ignorance to knowledge, in 
fact most of the people that you see in the street are like this. 
These are the objectives of people who have no other aim in 
life. Nobody in the whole world, from the time of its creation 
until its end, would deliberately choose anxiety, and would not 
desire to drive it far away. When I had arrived at this great 
piece of wisdom, when I had discovered this amazing secret, 
when Allah the Almighty had opened the eyes of my mind.


it should refrain from this passion, and the [Prophet’s] 
commandment to do as you would be done implies that the 
souls should turn away from the strong force of greed and lust 
and should uphold the authority or the means of justice which 
springs from the rationality which is part of the reasonable soul. 
I have seen the majority of people - except those who God the 
Almighty has protected, and they are few - throw themselves 
into the miseries, the worries and fatigues of this world, and 
pile up a mountain of sin which will mean that they enter 
hellfire in the Hereafter and will have no advantage from the 
perfidious intentions which they nurse so carefully, such as 
wishing for an inflation of prices which would bring disaster 
upon the children, the innocent, or wishing the worst trials 
upon those they hate. They know very well that these bad 
intentions will not necessarily bring about what they desire or 
guarantee its advent, and if they clarified and improved their 
intentions they would hasten the repose of their spirits. They 
would then have the time to devote themselves to their own 
business and would thus profit a great deal in addition to the 
return of their souls to God, and all this without having at all 
hastened or delayed the realization of their desires. Is there any 
worse deception than the attitude which we warn against here, 
and is there any greater happiness than the one which we are 
promoting?”122

I have a really hard time either processing emotions or understanding them.

Dichotomy on Control as an argument about Identity,"Here is something I've been considering that I wanted to get the community's opinion on. I think that the dichotomy of control is better understood as an argument about **identity** (what we fundamentally are), than an argument about control, influence, or cause. 

The Handbook introduces the Dichotomy of control as follows: ""Some things are within our power, while others are not. Within our power are opinion, motivation, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever is of our own doing; not within our power are our body, our property, reputation, office, and, in a word, whatever is not of our own doing."" ( Handbook 1.1 Hard Translation).

Most people take this to mean that there are three things are play:

1. Us (who we are)
2. The things up to us (Opinion, motivation, desire)
3. The things not up to us (body, our property, reputation).

Instead, I think the argument is better thought of as this:   
1. There are the things that we ARE, that make up our identity (our opinions and desires).  
2. There are the things that we ARE NOT, that don't make up our identity (our body, our reputation).

Therefore, we should focus on improving and caring about what we fundamentally are. Our life goes better when WE are better (better opinions, better desires). Our life does not go worse when things WE ARE NOT get damaged (our office, our property). The DOC then is not about describing what we can or can't control, but about where the limits of our identity lie, which technically for Epictetus is our Prohairesis (our faculty of choice).

It is a change in the emphasis of the argument. Epictetus is not *just* saying that we suffer when we try to control what is outside our control (although that is true). He is emphasizing that we suffer when we identify ourselves with the things that are not up to us. When we think something belongs to us (is up to us) that doesn't.

This is why in Discourses 1.1 Epictetus focuses so much on personal identity. He presents an example with a tyrant: ""'Tell me your secrets.' I won't reveal them; for that lies within my power. 'Then I'll have you chained up.' What are you saying, man, chain *me* up? You can chain my leg, but not even Zeus can overcome my power of choice (prohairesis). 'I'll throw you into prison.' You mean my poor body.""

The humour in this passage is that the tyrant is trying to threaten Epictetus, but the tyrant is applying a non-Stoic perspective. He is threatening Epictetus' body, but Epictetus realizes that he is not his body and so he is not intimidated. He is his character, his prohairesis, his capacity to make choices. That is what applying the Dichotomy of control looks like in action, not just saying ""oh well, I can't control what you do."".

What do you think?

How to avoid letting stoicism cause dismissiveness?,"“What can I do about my brothers anger?”

Nothing. You can do nothing about it. But you can control your response to his anger” I.e. don’t get angry just because he’s angry

This is true and it’s valuable to focus on not letting other people’s reactions cause you to react in a similar way

But at the same time, this feels pretty black and white. Maybe you can help your brother with his anger by asking what’s going on to cause it, maybe you did something that understandably contributed to his anger, and it’s unfair for you to say “hm his anger is his own problem, nothing I can do”. 

I guess what I’m asking is this: it seems that taking stoic lessons perfectly literally can cause some unfavorable interpersonal dynamics. Do you agree or disagree?",Stoicism,1703077627.0,t3_18mu6dh,0.87,11
I feel guilty and scared of my emotional responses,"Yesterday I had what started as a funny argument on a random topic. My sister and my husband had an opposite view as mine and both of them where interrupting me while I was trying to speak. I said “Shut the fuck up” which was meant in a jokingly way but my face showed my frustration of being repeatedly interrupted. They both said wow that’s not cool and I apologised on the spot. My sister got really triggered and threw in my face that I cry when someone tells me something that hurts my feelings but I say things like that when I am angry. Also I confess that lately I feel very emotional when I see my sister and my husband “coming together “ against me.

The point is that she has a point. I am a very sensitive person, I get emotional very easily and I just want to stop reacting. I feel like I always says something wrong and I feel terrible and insecure afterwards. I feel like I am a bad person for having these reactions. It looks like everyone can be cool and easy going but me, like I am always making mistakes and that the people I love will get tired of me.

Should I avoid confrontation? How can I be a better, wiser person? How do I deal with my insecurities?

I write this in this page because I am trying to learn stoicism. I spend most of my days alone at home and I feel happy and at peace. Then I am tested with actual people, and people are just hard form me. Any stoic material suggestions are appreciated.

I do get pleasure from reading, working out, playing chess, puzzles, sports etc but these things require a little more effort to do than watching videos on smartphone or any other digital product.

Stoicism on spending the holidays alone,I’m 25 and this upcoming Christmas will be the second straight year that I spend it alone. I don’t have many friends and my family is not tight knit in anyway. I feel like I’m wasting my youth in constant loneliness and it’s a pit that’s hard to escape from. This past year I’ve tried my best to make friends and connections and it seems that it just results in ppl who just come and go. I yearn for social connections and actual genuine friendships with people that I can learn and grow with. I value solitude but I’ve always felt there should be moderation between the two. Anyways ig I’m just looking for advice.,Stoicism,1703047295.0,t3_18mm426,0.72,6
What should a stoic define as true power?,"I'm in a career which gives me a lot of responsibility and authority but it tends to become fairly political. Due to this, mentors and advisors frequently recommend books like The Prince or the 48 Laws of Power. However, these books don't align with the values of a stoic and are ruthlessly pragmatic. I'm not sure how to incorporate the understanding I have gathered from these while maintaining my character.
The question I want to explore is how should I view power as a stoic, especially when the choices I make effect the lives of others. I literally hold people's lives in my hands due to my career, so do I owe it to them to be as ruthlessly pragmatic as possible?
Do I play the game and behave disingenuously, even if it goes again the principles of Stoicism?",Stoicism,1703041770.0,t3_18mkciy,0.85,9
Talk only when needed?,"After countless conversations I had with people, I am thinking about not getting involved in conversations.

Whenever I try to have a conversation, I try to be as close to reality as possible, instead of having my opinions or my conditioning. People most often take it offensive and project their hatred towards me.

Some people try to shut me off by saying I sound like a philosopher. Some people appreciate it though. 

It feels exhausting. I start to question why do I even have these conversations in the first place.

People often can't really accept reality. I don't know every truth ever. But I can perceive it to some extent.

To me a conversation is about exchange of information to learn and grow. There is some amount of egoic identity involved as well personally. I am not going to deny it. Still learning to not take it personally when I am defeated and trying to learn from it. 

I right now feel like I only need to talk when there is something gonna change if I contribute to the conversation. If things are not going to change, then why even take part in the conversation? 

If both the parties learn and grow, then it's fine. Or else observation and silence is better I guess.

Preparation for starvation," This may seem somewhat  pessimistic, but after deep consideration I realize this is a more likely issue I'm going to face in the future. Currently my families financial situation is mid at the moment. There's me, my mom and my grandfather. Truth be told we're solely dependent on my grandfather's pension. My mother is a housewife with only a high-school diploma. I passed my graduation and I have been trying for job for 6 years but to no hope whatsoever in the horizon. I did a lot of odd jobs and with recession in the country lost the current job I have. I'm have been trying for quite some time but it's to no avail. We have been rationing a lot of our food, but with grandfather's advance age and all and his medical bills, it seems it not enough. He's well psst 90 and he's have a lot of co morbidity. If he dies we can manage for a while but after a year or so we'll be dead broke. To prepare myself for that likely future I have been trying to prepare myself for stark starvation by eating a meal a day. Sometimes even no meals. I have been doing it for quite a few months now.

"Loved Meditations, STRUGGLING with Discourses","I read the Hayes translations of Meditations and loved it.  I then went to the Haward Morse audiobook of Discourses (Gregory Long translation.)  I'm STRUGGLING, with entire sentences, paragraphs passing by with little comprehension. The heavy English accent and old translation, combined with the fact that I consume these as audiobooks while doing long distance running, has me wondering if I'm wasting my time (7.5 more hours to go).

I'm trying to decide do I:

1. Quit, start over with a new translation and narrator, or
2. Suffer through it, or
3. Quit entirely and instead read a modern distillation of Stoicism (""The Daily Stoic"" or other)?

Thoughts?

&#x200B;

\[Update (12/24/23): I finished the G. Long translation of Discourses and have started the Dobbins translation (Penguin Classic).  One thing I happy to notice is how much sounds familiar. I absorbed a lot more from the G. Long translation than I thought. I like the modern (Dobbins) translation a lot better. I'm getting a tremendous amount out of it.

"I need good advice from some stoic men, because i dont know what will happen to me now, im getting death threats in highschool","So around two weeks ago, my life was going well, my self esteem was rising from a shit 2022, and i thought i was out of the ringer. Then all that hope was thrashed into peices. bassically this kid that i was sort of friends with made this rumor about me saying that i leaked his home adress. This was a blow as i thought this kid was my friend. Then my popualarity and reputation that i once had crumbled. I thought this was the deepest pit of hell a man can face, all his friends who he realises are fake leaving him, although it got worse, so much more worse. Then he added  me to this group chat on snapchat and got this kid to threaten me and press me, no matter how much i tried to explain they would not understamd the truth. They forced me to confess to somthing i did not do under the threat of a beating. And i thought that that was it, it got worse, this was probably the first time i experienced real trauma, and im only a highschooler. They added me to another chat with 15 other kids, who were all gang affiliated although in highschool and they threatened me, harrased me and even said they would stab me. Those thoughts keep me up at night. Anyways i kept this all to myself, my pearents did not need added stress, and i was forced to pay these people 20$ to let me live. It got worse, the next weekend i had a family gathering, in wich took my mind of taht trauma, on monday i checked my snapchat, apparently over the weekend i was placed in another groupchat with even more kids, giving more death threats to me. the things they said made my shiver, i gave one $20 now they all wanted up to 50$ saying they wanted a new vape or a new knife. But when they did not get a response from me as i was busy with the gathering and hanging out with my cousins. They moved on to 3 other kids, pressing them, death threating them, they sent images of their guns and knives and vapes to them, and even took $50 from them. I could not let this slide, i had to make sure this would nto happen again, i got another phone and recorded the whole conversation,this way they would not know i collected this. That should atleast send them to juvie right? But i wanna tell the authorities in a way that would not let them know that i was the snitch, cos if they find out man then idk what will happen... anyways its been 3 weeks, school break has started,i deleted my snap account and blocked them all, i only have my family and becaus of erliar events no friends to spend the break with.

My father is an enigma..,"I [33M], like many, used to think as my father as stoic, however, he's gotten soft and depressed in his older age, especially now that he's retired. Not that he's accomplished a  great deal in his life, but he raised me right, taught me how to be a strong leader, and remain unbothered by external happenings.

I enjoy giving him this credit but I've also done a fair bit of development personally, professionally, emotionally, spiritually, and have had other mentors over the last 5-10 years. I've also became a father myself this year and am learning from that. I often wonder, am I giving him too much credit for the man I am today?

What's bothering me tonight is that my father did not show up to the family Christmas party. There is no bad blood in the family either and although we only get together a few times a year, it's something he always looks forward to. Every time.

So goddamnit, why would you no-show?

I suspect he may have something going on with his health and doesn't want to face his kids. I fear that it may be bad enough to where he can't do anything about it.

Observation from Beyond Good and Evil regarding criticism of Stoicism,"I am working my way through Beyond Good and Evil for the first time. In book two, Nietzsche goes on a tirade against a few different philosophies - including Stoicism. In it, he mocked the Stoics for wanting to live in accord with nature and basically said the Stoics imprint their own morality onto nature this way and that nature is ultimately indifferent. 

Then, later in book III he is talking about religious people and specifically about Christianity in Europe. In this section he says:

“Then, during the moral epoch of mankind, one sacrificed to one’s God one’s own strongest instincts, one’s “nature“: this festive joy lights up the cruel eyes of the aesthetic, the “anti-natural” enthusiast.”


Seems to me like this definition of nature that he claims is being sacrificed is rather close to the Stoic idea of acting within one’s own nature. To “live according to one’s nature” as I understand it (correct me if I am wrong) means, broadly for humans, living in according with what makes humans unique - their ability to reason. 


Does it seem like his argument about sacrificing one’s nature seems to go against the argument he made against stoicism? In my reading it seems like he miss-characterized what “nature” is in the stoic context and then, albeit loosely, admitted to the existence of “nature” in the form the stoics use by conceding some people do sacrifice their nature.

I could be reading too much into it, any thoughts from someone more versed in Nietzsche and Stoic thought?",Stoicism,1702945878.0,t3_18locod,0.7,4

Tochange thoughts or actions?,"In a recent post, u/home_iswherethedogis commented:

>The only solution to cognitive dissonance is to change your actions. Sure, you can change your beliefs (opinions) about cigarettes to ""oh, I'm young, I'll worry about my lungs later,"" but this will keep you stuck in smoking because you can't change a habit without changing the belief surrounding it. 

Id like to discuss this specific part further. For this given example, in the end clinically smoking is bad for humans. The resolutions given when boiled down were change thoughts or change actions.

In a different case: Maybe someone percieves that their work environment is rather hostile to them. When in reality, everyone thinks they're mediocre at worst. They could change their actions in the form of a job change, or change the way they perceive the work environment.

Point being, if one decides to change something, how do they decide on how to change? Maybe this dips a little too far into the ""Stoicism is not a replacement for therapy"", maybe I'm getting too far into the weeds of it and it really is as simple as ""it depends""

I can’t cry anymore.,"Hi everyone,

I am on my stoicism journey since one and a half year. I love the idea of controlling myself, my thoughts, my emotions & my actions. Sometimes I am driven by external circumstances, but I think that I am making a great progress in quickly realising what is under my control and what is not.

The reason:
Since 2 months I am experiencing a downfall of my relationship. I know my faults, I know what I did wrong, and I am taking a full responsibility of changing those things. Simply saing - my fault is that I was controlling. 

But everything seems that there is nothing left to save - my woman is extremely passive-agressive towards me, almost to the point that I question my own humanity. She makes me feel like a monster. Someone that is not worth fighting for.

I live in a constant state of alert, wondering when the day of saying goodbye comes. One day everything seems fine, and the second day she strikes me right in my heart. And yet, I don’t feel sad. I don’t know how to blame her for being shitty because I know her behaviour is not under my control. At the same time I can’t stop loving her, because I see those good days we have had.

She might be doing this to break me & make me pull the trigger first, so I will be a „bad” one in this relationship. The one that decided to left. Or she might be testing me if I am all into really changing my behaviour.

The question:
The thing that bothers me the most is that I used to be a very emotional man, but I can’t dive into my feelings anymore. I used to cry when I was upset or sad, but I can’t do it anymore. I just can’t. And I know everything would be much easier for me if I could. 

Can it be an early stage of depression? What the #%@! should I do? What the virtuous, spiritual man would do being in my place? I know some things, but I definitely don’t know what to do in that exact situation. God, please, give me strength & courage to do the right thing.",Stoicism,1702941541.0,t3_18lmq9q,0.74,2
I feel an immense amount of guilt over kicking my brother out of my house after renting a room from me for 3 years.,"We are still talking, we are still on as good of terms as we could be on. He’s moved in with our parents. We’ve been fighting on and off for about a year and a half. About 7 months ago I told him he needs to find a new place, Listing the damage he’s done to my house and the constantly struggling to keep up with rent. Well on Monday we got into a fight. I told him he should find another place to stay once he got belligerent. I suspect drugs or alcohol may have been involved. On his way out he threw a bag through my front window (it’s a huge window that takes up the entire wall). I told him he’s not welcomed back after that. I don’t know why I feel so much guilt over this. I think I’ve made the right decision. Please let me know your thoughts.",Stoicism,1702933738.0,t3_18ljmpy,0.96,25
Explaining Mortality and Death To Small Kids,"Curious to get some perspective. 

My five year old son will make a wish blowing out a birthday candle or something and I always tell him I hope all his wishes come true.  The other day he said, he has a wish that he know won't come true and then whispered ""I don't want to die"".  He then said he also doesn't want me or other family members to die.  

It's odd how over the past several years studying stoicism I've just fallen into the habit of contemplating my mortality and that of my loved ones on a near daily basis.  This might sound incredibly depressing to some, but it's really not.  Rather I see it as just being aware of how nature works and it also gives perspective into what I think is important to do with the present moment.  It's also amazing how this habit has cleared up some fears and self-doubt, but I digress.  

I've gotten into the habit of thinking before I speak.  I think it's a good habit, otherwise I might have said something like: ""you're right, we're all going to die eventually and that's just how things work but try to not let it bother you"" or some other thing that probably wouldn't really be beneficial for either of us.  Instead I just said ""it's important to focus on the time we have right now and enjoy the present moment of being here with each other"" and gave him a big hug.  

I feel like I somewhat avoided the question and have been thinking of other ways that I could respond, so appreciate any other perspectives.  

Thanks!

How do I behave around people I have disappointed (including myself)?,"Few months ago, a girl I was dating suddenly broke up with me without much of closure (we had some communication problems and her being younger, she was in a different life stage). Unfortunately, going to the same band, which I was not willing to give up after 8 years of playing, I had to see her quite regularly. Even still, recently, I have finally started to move on. Then, three days ago, we were at the same party with our band and I got blackout drunk (although this kind of behaviour is not usual for me). 

Afterwards, I found out directly from her that I wanted to talk with her about us, although she did not, and that I behaved like a condescending jerk. She did not want to elaborate further, simply stating 'drunk men's words are sober man's thoughts', so I don't know my behaviour specificaly (and I really fear it could have been even worse). Of course I apologized and promised it won't happen again, giving myself a word I will further limit my occasional alcohol consumption. However, I have never thought I could behave like this and feel that I have deeply let myself down. Furthermore, I hate that seomeone will judge me based on my drunk actions and today, I have to see the whole band again and I am so ashamed of myself I don't even know how to behave.",Stoicism,1702896007.0,t3_18l5rnm,0.4,0

How can Stoicism be used to cope with self-inflicted health problems?,"I'm struggling to cope with multiple health problems that I did to myself through poor lifestyle choices.

I'd find it easier to deal with these health problems if they were out of my control and considered externals, but since I did these health problems to myself, I feel that makes it impossible to mentally deal with – and I can't stop beating myself up.

Is Stoicism only for the mentally sane?,"In Stoicism there is a great emphasis on man's ability to reason.

A visualization/realization I've been having,"I thought I would share this in hopes sometime else has success with it.

I've studied Taoism in the past, and although I find it really similar to Stoicism, they go about things so differently.  Taoism seems to focus on truly accepting the things we can't change, while stoicism focuses on making the changes we with what we have.

With Taoism, I would do meditations where I imagined having an energy/chi inside me providing me with stability and warmth.  It's been very relaxing and calming to do this, especially while anxious.  So I decided to see how I could apply this to Stoicism.

When I think about what I can really change, it comes down to literally moving my hands, getting up, etc. way more than making money out something abstract as that.  So with that, I've been imagining the same ball of energy I used to keep on the inside, but just barely outside of me.  The gravity of it almost pulls me to motion and helps me see I am in control of myself completely and not ""stuck to the couch"" or whatever.

As a last note, these are purely meditations and figments of the imagination.  I see visualisation of my chi as similar to a *dogmata* or *mantra*, not something real or tangible.",Stoicism,1702876503.0,t3_18l0zkb,0.6,1

This enchiridion chapter.,"""If you intend to improve, throw away such thoughts as these: if I neglect my affairs, I shall not have the means of living: unless I chastise my slave, he will be bad. For it is better to die of hunger and so to be released from grief and fear than to live in abundance with perturbation; and it is better for your slave to be bad than for you to be unhappy.1 Begin then from little things. Is the oil spilled? Is a little wine stolen? Say on the occasion, at such price is sold freedom from perturbation; at such price is sold tranquillity, but nothing is got for nothing. And when you call your slave, consider that it is possible that he does not hear; and if he does hear, that he will do nothing which you wish. But matters are not so well with him, but altogether well with you, that it should be in his power for you to be not disturbed.""

How to deal with expectations of recognition for doing the right thing?,"I've been interested in stoicism for a few years, and although I wouldn't say I'm an avid student of it, I do try to implement the stoic virtues and practices in my life.

By doing this, I find that often I choose the path of righteousness, of forgiveness, and seldom do I seek revenge or do evil.

My problem, however, is that I keep expecting recognition for doing such things. I feel like I deserve congratulations for making the rigth choices and doing the right acts. And I realize this corrupts my initial intentions as a whole. To the point where I can't tell when I'm doing good because I am virtuous and when I'm doing it to be percieved as good and mature.

To give you an example, I recently ended a friends with benefits kind of relationship, and this person is now dating my best friend. Note that I told my friend beforehand that if he was interested in her, I wouldn't be a problem and he could go for it. I had also told her during our arrangement that if she was interested in him, it would be okay, and she could just tell me and we'd end our relationship for the sake of theirs (because I didn't want a commitment with her, and they both wanted it).

She did not tell me she was interested, but she showed clear signs. She was quite disrespectful and hurtful to me a few times due to her inability to perceive and communicate her feelings. And I just did what was best for me and ended things between us.

And now, all I can fathom is that I made their relationship possible, and I feel like both her and my friend should thank me for it.

How do I get rid of this expectation? I've been reading Meditations but to no avail thus far.

"Not sure what the point of this post is, maybe just to get things off my mind."," 

Im a 20-year-old guy who recently wrapped up my gap year with a lot of hard work. Despite earning good money, I didn't save any. I spent it on a car and started but never finished my driving license. Now, the car sits unused, and another insurance payment is coming up.

Most of my earnings went into partying and, unfortunately, drugs. Thankfully, I've kicked that habit and don't feel the urge anymore—except when I drink, which is rare now. I've started university but missed three months of classes. I want to contact university about my situation but im scared they will kick me out for not doing any work at all. I like my course and the topics, but I can't bring myself to engage. I label myself as lazy, but when I attempt something, I can't seem to enjoy it.

While I hesitate to say I'm depressed, I feel lost. I enjoy life, people, even the ""bad"" ones, but I struggle to like myself or work on self-improvement. I have a wonderful girlfriend, and I know I'm smart, but when things start improving, I feel out of place, and they take a downturn again.

Two years ago, I lost my dad to alcohol, went through a breakup, and lost a friend, all in one year. Looking back, that seems to be when things started spiraling, and im not looking for an excuse, i cannot control that. 

I often compare myself to my successful sister, measuring my worth by materialistic standards, despite knowing it's not a healthy approach.

Today, my MacBook screen broke, adding to my stress as repairs will strain my already dead budget, but life continues with or with out. I'm not sure if this post even makes sense, but I felt the need to write and seek constructive criticism or just an understanding ear. It's strange—I know what I need to do, but I'm just not doing it. I'm trying, but it's all so confusing. This may sound like a cry for help, and I'm aware of that. I appreciate stoicism and the people here, and I just wanted to unload my thoughts.

If most of this doesnt make sense, dont worry, it doesnt in my head also.

Does being virtuous becomes easier and easier the more virtuous you become?,"Today I was thinking about why I had no will to do what I'm supposed to do(study some engineering concepts), my mind keeps creating like mechanisms for me to think ""why would I suffer studying, maybe I am having a burnout?(lol)"" and then, when the end of the day comes and I did nothing, I feel like shit.

"A question about Risk, its worthiness and untimely death","Hello, 
I've been thinking of taking up some activities ( motorcycling, horse riding , a career that's risky in terms of mortality) that are sort of risky but am afraid of doing them for fear of injury or worse.

All my life I've erred on the side of caution, taking only calculated risks where the risks seems worthy enough, if the possibility of danger was even nominal I'd back off ( for example, i recently decided not to do river rafting). I am not lacking in courage but feel it best only to take risks that are ""worth it"".

Now I've been through some of the writings of George RR Martin and while its fiction in it a good number of characters -- good and bad die in the both unexpected and gruesome ways never fulfilling their destiny or their potential for great and noble things.

It also reminded me of Alexander The Great who wanted to conquer the world but died of Malaria, the second of the Mughal conquerers Humayan who died -- by falling from stairs in a library! 

The last great Hindu king who came from nothing but died from a single stray arrow hitting the only small single gap in his armor, Christopher reeves who fell from horseback and got paralyzed..any many other examples.

It makes me feel its better to stick to only necessary things. 

Why take these risks (motorcycling, horse riding) at all? I can make go through it for the career

This makes me afraid, what if i take any of these risks and get scared injured or die ...never even beginning to have fulfilled my duties or potential? 

P.S. I understand about the dichotomy of control and am not scared of death as a concept ( Death smiles at all men...all a man can do is smile back)..but the timing and worthiness of it",Stoicism,1702818583.0,t3_18kh0t8,0.9,8

Stoic View on Entertainment,"I recently watched All Quiet on the Western Front and enjoyed it.  I didn’t spend time analyzing my judgments about the movie while it’s happening as that would distract me from the plot. I just let my emotions run without questioning them. 

While watching movies I allow myself to get emotionally invested in the characters and the overall narrative for the duration of the film. A large part of the enjoyment I get out of reading fiction is from getting caught up in narrative, and viewing the world through the characters perspectives. These characters are usually flawed in some ways of course and are going to have errors in their reasoning.  Similarly, a large part of watching live sports is rooting for a team. 

Would a stoic forgo these aspects of entertainment for the sake of virtue?  If so, do those of you strictly practicing stoicism miss these pastimes?

How do those of you currently practicing stoicism regard movies, novels, and similar entertainment?

A unique and frustrating relationship (need good stoic advice),"Hey everyone. I consider myself an amateur stoic; have read Aurelius and Seneca and am currently reading Epictetus. 

A little background: So I had a 5+ year relationship that ended late 2021. We ended up remaining best friends to this day. Since then, I wanted to get back with her, but have tabled it due to her wanted to work on herself and heal some personal trauma(due to school and family deaths). Throughout the process, I have really tried to be patient, but the past 6 months or so I have been losing my patience with the situation.

The real issue: I am fine with the whole “single” dynamic and letting her heal on her own. However, I do have personal sexual needs that are not being met (I have high sex drive). The last time we had sex was Jan 2022. We live together in seperate rooms but still kiss and maintain a closeness. I have tried to work with her and be patient and understanding but there have been so many times where something can happen and she pulls away. At this point, seeing how much I am hurting, she has told me to look elsewhere to get what I need. The problem with this is that I am devoted to her and am not looking for sex in that kind of way. I am at my breaking point. It not like I am addicted or am falling prey to my desires, as I have done without for past 2 years. But I also want to experience fun and life. 

Stoicism has definitely helped me maintain the past year. But the lack of any progress coupled with my inability to move on is shaking me. Reading Seneca and how he talks about time makes this situation feel all the more urgent to me…

Stoicism for Action,"These are four principles I've written up for myself regarding Stoic action, expressing my view that Stoicism demands service to others in order to live in accordance with nature. 

I've followed each with a personal description and some of my favorite quotes regarding the matter, and included some various links to relevant articles (I <3 Donald Robertson). This is not meant to be a comprehensive defense of that view but sharing my personal reflections on it. 

&#x200B;

1. [The Common Good](https://modernstoicism.com/perspectives-the-stoics-on-the-community-of-humankind/) —> All our aims and actions should be directed towards benefitting the common good, as is in line with natural conduct and the path of virtuous action. We are temperate and courageous so we may [advocate for justice](https://www.orionphilosophy.com/stoic-blog/the-stoic-virtue-of-justice), not for tranquility or our own happiness.
   1. The pursuit of virtue, of justice among people, is that of virtuous action. To act with love, kindness, and compassion towards all others as one humanity; to engage, not withdraw, from public involvement.
   2. *“Born for society, \[the Stoics\] all believed it was their destiny to labor for it; with so much the less fatigue, their rewards were all inside themselves. Happy by their philosophy alone, it seemed as if only the happiness of others could increase theirs.”* (Montesquieu, The Spirit of Laws, 1748)
   3. *“Revere the gods, and look after each other. Life is short — the fruit of this life is a good character and acts for the common good.”* (Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations*, 6.30)
   4. *""The primary mission of the Stoics, in other words, is to be helpful to others and serve the greater good, and they don't do this to make themselves happy. They do it becaues it is the right and natural way to live. But doing it in that spirit, as it turns out, makes them happy.""* (Ward Farnsworth, *The Practicing Stoic*, 208)
   5. *""\[Happiness is found indirectly in the pursuit of other things, which as\] proposed by the Stoic consists primarily of a dedication to reason and a commitment to others -- to service, to justice, to helping in the ways one can.""* (Ward Farnsworth, *The Practicing Stoic*, 209)  

2. [**The Reserve Clause**](https://donaldrobertson.name/2013/02/02/action-with-a-reserve-clause-in-marcus-aurelius/) —> Engaging with the world of indifferents, we must act with detachment: We shall do our utmost to serve the common good, “Fate permitting.”
   1. To succeed or to fail does not make us virtuous. To act energetically in the name of good intentions is all we have the choice of doing. With a reserve clause, a life of pursuing and falling short of justice is still the noblest path.
   2. *“Try persuasion first, but even though men would say to you not to, act when the principles of justice direct you to. If anyone one should obstruct you by force, take refuge in being contented and without emotional pain, and use the obstacle for the display of some other virtue. Remember that the impulse you had was with an “reserve clause”, and your aim was not to do the impossible.”* (*Meditations*, 6.50)
   3. *“Though a man may in some sort hinder my activity, yet on my own voluntary impulses and mental attitude no fetters can be put because of the “reserve clause” and their ability to adapt to circumstances. For everything that stands in the way of its activity is adapted and transmuted by the mind into furtherance of it, and that which is a check on this action is converted into a help to it, and that which is a hindrance in our path goes but to make it easier.”* (*Meditations*, 5.20)  

3. [**Virtue in**](https://donaldrobertson.name/2018/05/15/the-stoic-socrates-four-emotional-resilience-strategies/) **& through Adversity** —> The world provides us with challenges so that we may test ourselves, become more virtuous and capable, and learn to find the value in all that may happen. We have virtues to face challenges; by facing challenges, we become virtuous. 
   1. We are to recognize and love the necessity of obstacles; appreciate our natural ability to confront and overcome it; seek the chance to prove and train ourselves, and find the humor and purpose granted by reversals.
   2. [Life as a “ball game”:](https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/stoicism-as-a-ball-game/) We seek to play with care and respect for other players, acknowledge their efforts to defeat us with calm, and exert ourselves fully with skill *and* neutrality towards the outcome.  A challenge to play well, not flip out. (1)
   3. *“Good men work, spend and are spent, and they do so willingly. Fortune does not drag them; they follow, and keep step.”* (Seneca, On Providence 5.4)

   5. “*And yet life, Lucilius, is really a battle. For this reason those who are tossed about at sea, who proceed uphill and downhill over toilsome crags and heights, who go on campaigns that bring the greatest danger, are heroes and front-rank fighters; but persons who live in rotten luxury and ease while others toil, are mere turtle-doves safe only because men despise them.”* (Seneca, *Moral Letters to Lucilius*, 96)  

4. [Stoic Joy](https://donaldrobertson.substack.com/p/three-sources-of-happiness-in-stoicism) —> It is in the activities of virtuous pursuit that we find cause to be joyful regarding our own virtue, the virtues of others, and joy in our lot in the world.
   1. We need not suppress our disappointments and frustrations, but rather recognize that they do not undermine the importance of virtuous action. With detachment and present-mindedness, they are easily endurable. 
   2. To the Stoic, virtue alone is sufficient for happiness under any circumstances. It is a rewarding experience to serve others, and enjoy exercising our ability to do so. We may find pleasure in acting out our natural function. 
   3. *“A man when he has done a good act, does not call out for others to come and see, but he goes on to another act, as a vine goes on to produce again the grapes in season.”* (Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations* 5.6)
   4. *""...Happiness is not supposed to be the Stoic goal, not even covertly. The Stoic view, rather, is that one should embrace virtue for its own sake, and that doing so is necessary to get the good side effects of it.""* (Ward Farnsworth, *The Practicing Stoic*, 209)

About substances such as caffeine and energy drinks.,"Caffeine is a substance that brings us physical benefits, such as mood and energy, which is especially useful for those who maintain a physical exercise routine.  However, it is addictive and if consumed in excess can cause death.  The same could be said with energy drinks, which have high doses of caffeine.  What kind of attitude would a Stoic take towards this substance?  Consume it, with the aim of reaching your peak in your training, or abstain from this practice?  What actually differentiates a caffeine consumer from a cocaine addict, metaphysically speaking?",Stoicism,1702738241.0,t3_18jssj8,0.79,19
How do I stop expecting things from people/the world?,"I’m very much new to stoicism, I’ve started reading the important texts but I haven’t gotten very deep yet.

Also I’m aware that some people here are bothered by relationship drama stuff, but here I’m just using it as the most convenient and relevant example.

My partner of 5 years left me for someone else. I haven’t been the perfect partner for her, but I supported her through many trials, made sacrifices for the relationship, etc. Obviously given how she left me for someone else and wasn’t very kind or caring towards me through the break-up process. Regardless of how much I understand how it’s irrational to expect her to treat me more “fairly” and be more grateful for the things I did and sacrificed for her throughout our relationship, deep down I can’t help but do expect it from her and be upset that she did not. Of course this is just one example, as since getting more into stoicism I noticed how much I expect from people and the world and how much energy and words I waste being upset at things/people not turning out how I would want them to. I tell myself and the rational “part” of my brain understands that it’s foolish to wish for a fig in winter. But deeper inside my soul I still cry out for the fig. I’m not sure how stoics are able to rewire themselves to stop wishing for it. Are there exercises for this specifically?

Any help would be appreciated, thank you.",Stoicism,1702718739.0,t3_18jnmtf,0.91,9

Marcus Aurelius teaches to not complain; I kinda disagree.,"The quote goes ""Don't be overhead complaining... not even to yourself"" -Marcus Aurelius, 8.9.  

Complaining is all about emotional expression. when an emotion is dominating your mind it becomes easy to become hopeless, and feel like you cannot fix the problem. When you vent out this emotion (complaining is an easy way to do that), it allows your brain to operate clearly and it removes that burden from your mind. So id wager it's more beneficial to complain in moderation than to not most of the time. Also, from my experience it's a great ice breaker, an easy way to relate to other people, and often doesn't come off as annoying.

How Would a Stoic Deal With a Conservative Religious Family?,"Hi all, I'm a 21 Y.O. living in the UK.  


Roughly 3 years ago, I accepted to myself that I am no longer a Muslim, but rather an agnostic. I kept this hidden from my family, even when they knew that I had a lot of doubts and questions concerning Islam. They demand that I pray all 5 of my daily prayers with them, that I attend religious classes and that I cut ties with any non-religious friends that I may have.  


Fast-forward to today. I have a decent paying job, I have a tenancy agreement for an apartment that I can move into within the next month, and there's a lot of tension that's hard to avoid between my family and I. I believe that moving out will help in raising my self-esteem and my ability to be honest with my parents. They're worried that I'll condemn myself to hell if I don't work on increasing my knowledge when it comes to Islam, and that me considering moving out is a sign that I'm looking to part ways with my family. I've tried to ease their worries by telling them that I'd visit every weekend or so and that my main reason for moving out is to commute into work easier, but all I'm met with are tears, scoldings and guilt-tripping. 

Their actions are understandable. I've told them that I still share their faith, even if I have tons of doubts. They believe that the doubts will only go away once I've submitted myself to god and worked on gaining knowledge in Islam. But the truth is, I have no intention of exploring Islam. I don't want to live the double-life wherein I pretend to be someone I'm not around my family. I understand that telling my family that I'm no longer Muslim could lead to shunning and disownment , but I recognize that this is something I'll have to do. 

I'm feeling a lot of pressure from my siblings, which i find incredibly troubling to deal with. I'm not sure how I can deal with the accusations that I'm causing my parents a lot of suffering, and that It's within my best interests to work on fulfilling their criteria (spending more time with family, going to prayers more often, etc) before moving out. What I haven't told them is that the stress of having to put up a facade around them has lead to me isolating myself from the family. My siblings hold me responsible for my parent's sadness, and that I should forget about the tenancy agreement for the apartment and never bring it up with my parents again.

I'm unsure of what to do next. Part of me believes that I should notify my parents that I've signed the tenancy agreement, move out and then work on telling my family that I'm agnostic. Part of me sees that me bringing it up would only cause pain and more tension, so therefore I shouldn't tell them and I should work on moving out without them noticing.  


What would your stoic tips be for dealing with a situation like this? Would it be acceptable for me to lie about not signing the tenancy agreement to avoid conflict? 

*(TL;DR: Left Islam. Now living a double-life around family. Unsure if I should tell my family that I've decided to move out)*

My logic for ending it,"I have really screwed up life for me and my partner.

On Anger,"We all get angry, and stoics would argue that it's how we control that emotion is the important part. But I read this quote and it hit me as a connection I had never made before: ""Anger is an emotional response to an unfulfilled expectation."" I realized how true that was - that when I felt anger it was because something was not happening the way I felt it should.

However this then begged the question: ""So do we then not have any expectations, if we don't want to feel anger?"" Not very realistic, and nihilistic really, which I don't think is any real way to live, but! If you have 0 expectations for anyone or anything then you no longer deal with anger.

So then is it better to temper expectations AND control the emotion of anger?

But if the goal is to \*feel\* less anger; then simply controlling it, isn't really the answer either. I apologize for my rambling - I'm just trying to write down what has been rolling around in my head for the last little bit.

Any advice or insights that I'm missing?",Stoicism,1702654507.0,t3_18j2sb8,1.0,10
Having trouble reading Epictetus,"Hi,

I've read The Meditations (and loved it) so I wanted to see what Epictetus had to say as well. I got to about chapter 18 (or I18?) in book 1 and honestly I'm just confused at this point. 

I understand the Discourses are, well, discourses and not really a book written by Epictetus himself, but still I find his arguments being rather confusing and messy. Not very clear. 

For example: Chapter, 17, is titled ""concerning the necessity of logic"" (I got the penguin classics edition). Epictetus starts by presenting a problem/paradox - reason can only be analyzed either by itself or by something superior, however ""there is nothing superior to reason"" and reason cannot analyze itself because it creates an endless loop. Then he goes on to address a claim (hypothetical or from someone in the audience? i'm not sure) saying that regardless, emotions are more important than logic, only to show that it isn't the case and that no debate could be held with rules set by emotions.

So, he says, we use logic to define the terms in which we analyze things and discuss among ourselves (but how is that related to the paradox at the begging?). Then he goes on to argue against another claim against logic and then he ends up with talking about understanding nature, some victim of something unclear and then God and a philosopher's power of interpretation.

Of course it's much more complicated but I tried to keep it short XD

So as you can see, this is what I got from this chapter. Honestly I don't understand what he was trying to say and it's the same in most of the other chapters. He seems a bit all-over-the-place for me.

I wanted to know if other readers faced the same problem or is it just me? Is he getting clearer in following chapters? Maybe you could give me tips on how to read Epictetus, maybe I'm missing something?

Stoicism as an ever evolving philosophy,"In my mind, stoicism must evolve and change with the times to remain relevant. Marcus Aurelius, one of the most quoted and beloved stoic thinkers would most likely not fit the mold of how we think of stoics today. Despite being a man that pursued virtue as the highest importance he owned slaves. Would owning a slave today fit our judgment of what it means to be Just, one of the touchstones of stoic philosophy? I certainly hope not! People are a product of their time and their experiences.

Stoic advice for the probable loss of a pet?,"I've been reading about stoicism for about a year now and its had a huge impact on my mental health, however recently my ability to put it to use has been tested to say the least. 

This may seem trivial compared to other peoples problems, but I have a young cat (soon to be five y/o) who I may lose in the near future. He has a condition he has to be medicated for and this medication has a long list of probable side effects, the biggest one being another illness where I have decided that I would rather put him down than make him go through that treatment.

This is not a 100% certanity, but it is indeed a very probable risk and I cannot stop worrying, waiting and bracing myself for the heartache of having to decide to let him go. I have had more time than many others have gotten and I try to be thankful for this and to appreciate each day instead of thinking about the next, but this is constantly on my mind and I feel so sad and anxious about it.

How stoics deals with racism?,"I come from oppressed community in India, Chamar, we are untouchables or Dalits, we're still treated like trash in my country. I want to do good things for the people not just for mine but for everyone. But the criticism and everything stops me and makes me anxious.

Although I haven't experienced discrimination directly. But I read it online about growing violence against our community. I have experienced it indirectly a lot. I tried to be best for my whole life and I succeeded in that too, I topped my school and college. People say that I am mediocre Dalit and that whatever I get is because of reservations (which is a special law for giving equal opportunity for oppressed communities, by allowing equal representation of people in education and other areas, like affirmative action). Think of Jews living in ghettos during ww2 Germany (I don't mean to offend anyone nor I am associating with worst tragedy in history, it's just the growing violence scares me and I can resonate with that event). Because of this and reading about violence, I hardly talk to anyone because I am scared to be out in public. I stopped going out for dates and asking out many years ago, cuz I am afraid that it will end badly and no one wants to get married and associated with a ""Dalit"". I am too scared of achieving my goals because everything in India is based on casteism, I may not find a house on rent because my caste. It's just bad here.

I used to lie in school about my caste.

Even though it happened it hasn't turned me into a bitter person. I respect every individual and empathize with others. I control my anger nor do I argue with someone who calls me names or makes fun of my community and call us scums. It's just that I am scared to do anything. Because if I achieve something in life I will be known as ""Dalit boy who... achieved something"" not a ""College boy who... achieved something"" or ""Engineering student who... achieved something""

If I have to do something I have to stay in limits because that may exploit my caste and people will bash my family for this reason.

Seeing things just as they are,"Hello everybody. 
Lately I've been advancing in my studies of Stoicism and I've come to a realization, more of the development of a skill actually. Lately I have been able to see things the way they are. What do I mean by this?

Someone says an insult. Is it good? Bad? It was just an insult, or more radically, just words that were cataloged negatively by us.

Someone outplayed you? They just did a certain action. Now it is up to you to cataloge it in a way.
 
Do you feel frustration? It was just a feeling that makes you stay alert and feel weird things, not necessarily bad. 

After meditating on this new skill that I have been developing, I was very confused how should I use it in a way that is constructive, for the Virtue, for the community and for my path. Now I realize that insults are starting to lose meaning for me, therefore they start to mean less and less, it's just words, and now I feel some kind of power, like ""I can do whatever I want with that insult"". Destructive behaviors, the same. I have been gradually overcoming that confusion through Stoic ethics, at least the few I've studied about it. I decide to use this for what I judge to be good, the justice, for the community, for my learning and development path. It is interesting. Have any of you experienced this before?

Antipater,"I see a lot of people seeking advice so I thought I would switch things up with some food for thought. Stoicism seems to be perceived as an all or nothing philosophy that encourages us to not feel and discourages us when we fall short. This doesn’t have to be the case. Antipater, the 6th leader of the stoic school formed by Zeno, took the philosophy in another direction than his predecessors by loosening some of the absolutist rules that had been laid before him. Early stoics held that all sins were wrong and equal. Antipater rejected this notion recognizing that stealing a loaf of bread is not the same as murdering the baker for the bread. In Lives of the Stoics, by Stephen Hanselman and Ryan Holiday, they compare the modern stoic to an archer. “We train and practice. We draw back the arrow and aim it to the best of our abilities. But we know full well that despite our training and our aim, many factors outside our control will influence where the arrow hits the target-or if it falls short entirely. We take action. But much happens after that-much of it is not remotely up to us. Which is why we know that our true worth does not reside in whether or not we get a bullseye.”  I thought that was a fitting analogy.

That came to my mind because a lot of times I end up being caught on my own thoughts in the mid of the day trying to judge some action of mine and this leads to more untoughtful actions.

But can we really control the fact we feel emotions?  I've never met anyone who doesn't experience them, and personally they feel very instant and inevitable.  It seems like to me, I have an inevitable emotion, and then a controllable, separate, external reaction to it.

To me, once I'm already feeling an emotion, it makes it much worse to try and suppress it.  So I kind of just give myself permission to feel whatever naturally comes.  Letting myself be okay with not being okay is deeply liberating and has really been centering to me emotionally, but it seems this isn't the majority consensus on the stoic treatment of emotions, and me admitting to others I'm feeling certain emotions isn't stoic at all.  But when I do this, I feel much more calm and controlled, and the emotions I do have are smaller on the outside.

So I wanted to ask if there's an appropriately stoic way to see this.  I've been reading Epictetus and so far nothing in the enchiridion goes against what I'm saying.  But it seems this is not the common interpretation of the content, and that most have a concept of a stoic being a sort of iceman/woman

I'm interested to see what others think about this, so I thought I would ask.",Stoicism,1702565145.0,t3_18ia6v6,0.82,18
My mind goes nuts over a choice that I didn't have,"I want to embrace stoicism, but my mind keeps pointing me back to my ""old"" ways. 

This is the weirdest most recent example: 
I recently started a new job. Part of that was getting a company car. Normally you'd order one from the 3 choices the company has for you, these are mainly the cheapest versions of cars. With the push to ev's however this means I can only choose electric cars. We already have one ev at home and like an ice car as backup, so my only option is getting one from the company pool. 

I had two choices: a few months old ford focus or a 3 years old Opel Astra. I obviously went for the Ford, added bonus is that when i do have to pick an EV i can pick a more matured one. 

Now I have a colleague who was fortunate and could choose one of the last Ice cars. He went for the new Opel Astra. Turns out that basic Astra is way more luxurious than my Ford albeit a bit more expensive. 

My mind now constantly goes into ""what if"" mode. Because of course, my mind believes the new Opel is the better choice. I believe this goes back to my constant persuit of perfection. If i have choices, no matter what they are about, u always try to go for the best and very best one. 

Tl;dr:
My mind is contemplating over a choice I didn't even have. Stoicism tells me that all I have control over is my own judgement, yet my mind can't stop overthinking this. What to do? 

And yes, I know this is a first world problem. I'm happy with the car and very fortunate, but I also want to make clear that I do pay for it.",Stoicism,1702547760.0,t3_18i59ss,0.62,3
"""There is nothing fearful in nature for the rational man""","I've come across this quote in a lecture about Marcus Aurelius ( Michael Sugrue). Quotes like this and others

""He who fears death will never do anything worth of a man who is alive"" - Seneca.

underscore  the paralyzing effect of fear. I often find myself hesitating to do stuff held back by the uncertainty and anxiety surrounding the unknown, so by fear. Most of these fears are irrational. Quotes like this remind that life is meant to be lived and always avoiding things u fear kills u in a metaphorical sense. And if worse comes to worst injury, death or other losses are all just part of nature and therefore not anything to be afraid of.

Anyone else share this experience?

how to contain physical pain ?,"In the mediations marcus clearly states that mind and body are separate. one can maintain calm even during physical pain

because it is so difficult to be aware of my thoughts all the time and because it is difficult for me to discard it even though I know it will do me good.,"Imagine, you wake up, you start training, then you go to work, on the way to the bus you read, you get to work and then a thought comes to your head that you are a sick person with strange tastes, the thought distracts you and makes you uncomfortable because A part of you says it's true, you decide to concentrate and continue with your work and everything goes more or less well. then when you get home you do your chores and go to sleep, the thought comes back and makes your head hurt and you want to listen to loud music to stop listening to yourself, you do it, it's 2 am, in 3 hours you have to get up and you keep thinking about it and you want to scratch your back.

A stoic perspective on the irreplaceable,"My Dad passed away suddenly this year. First and foremost he was an amazing father with a deep sense of duty and community. He was a well respected Jungian psychologist both in his practice and as a professor. He was a role model in the relationship he shared with my mom and a man that practiced what he preached. He has been the most influential person in my life.

I’m posting this in hope that someone else may find value in my reflections on how stoicism influenced my thoughts around his passing. 

————

When we accept that we have been deprived of something we once had, our next logical instinct is to choose one of the following courses of action: find it, replace it, or do without it.

When something irreplaceable is taken, we cannot find it again because it exists nowhere else. We cannot replace it, as that is the definition of irreplaceable. Then, we are seemingly left with only one option: to do without. What may seem as the lesser of three outcomes is the most beautiful. 

When we accept the nature of what was given back as irreplaceable we can only choose to do without. Once that choice is made we can be at peace with what was given back. We no longer struggle to find what we had again or recreate it. Accepting that we will never have what we had ever again is not a lamentation, it is a testament to how beautiful and special it was. 

We must see ourselves as artists and what is gone as our work of art. We may enjoy creating the work, admire its shape as it takes form, and even the struggle to make it beautiful. The complete and refined beauty of our work can only be seen after we are finished with it. Our appreciation for what we created is deepened when we know every step that formed it.

We shouldn’t look back at what we had and wish we still had it. We now have the privilege to look back on it as completed. We get to admire how beautiful our journey with it was from start to finish. Our focus is on how grateful we are that fate allowed us to have something so precious at all, regardless of duration. 

It’s the rarest joy to give back something that cannot be replaced.

"A short review, and a question, regarding unearned wisdom in the modern era. Would love to hear your thoughts.","UNEARNED WISDOM IN THE MODERN ERA

Growing up and living in the modern era provides a unique experience, compared to our ancestors’, in respect to the accessibility of information. In a world where we are more interconnected than ever before, we are blessed to have instant and untethered access to knowledge and information in mere seconds, through use of the internet.

Lessons that once took a near lifetime to learn can be easily accessed by keyboard. Endless archives of wisdom, built upon through the ages, as a result of hard work and discipline, hand us the opportunity to learn and grow on a silver platter.

Herein the problem lies, many of us are constantly looking outwards for answers, or worse yet, outsourcing a sense of purpose and growth, subcontracting the hard work and toil required to gain such wisdom, and condensing said effort into mere seconds, leaving us overstimulated, desensitised, and none-the-wiser.

Knowledge, without practical application, is almost useless. That is, unless your goal is to *sound* like someone who has their life together. But actions speak louder than words, and eventually these pseudo-sages will demonstrate their lack of self control.

So, then the question remains, how do you pick the low-hanging fruit of the modern day world, and turn it into actual, practical wisdom?

Wisdom can be defined as *‘the quality of having experience, knowledge and good judgement’.*

In order to reach good judgement, we must first possess the knowledge, which can be unlocked through the experience.

Here is a step-by-step process for effectively gaining accurate wisdom through experience:

**Step One**

A certain event will happen, which has a significant outcome, either expected or not. The more intensely positive, or negative, the experience is, the more valuable information there may be to learn, and the higher levels of emotion that may be produced as a by-product.

**Step Two**

Reflection on the experience, if possible including the ability to compare it to others, the vision to explore other possible outcomes, creating knowledge. Reflection must come from an emotionally stable perspective, otherwise it can distort the lesson which remains to be learned.

For example, a start-up business which fails, losing a lot of money, will be a highly emotional event, but inside will be a treasure trove of knowledge and experience, which could undoubtedly help in the future.

Concerning pearls of wisdom, it should be known, that in order to claim the precious gemstone from the tightly clasped oyster, your fingers will get sore and bloodied in the process.

If the event is reviewed from an emotionally driven perspective, the person involved may say: “I knew my colleagues were right, I am not cut out to be a businessman, I should have just stayed in my previous job.”

But this does not give much, if any, useful feedback. It just provides an emotional reasoning as to why the event unfolded this way, rather than a logical situational report which can better guide us in the future.

And this kind of emotional response is not only negatively-based, for example if the same new business was instantly a huge success, perhaps the emotionally driven reflection would be: “I am so great at opening businesses. I must have the golden touch!” – creating a false sense of genius in oneself, leading to overreaching and under-preparing later on.

In order to be successful and accurate in your reflection of events, you must be emotionally removed. This can take time, to detach yourself from the immediacy of the situation, but necessary in order to have an impartial perspective.

**Step Three**

The ability to judge new situations, and modify choices or behaviour based on the knowledge gained from previous experience, thus defining wisdom.

In order to be able to draw on such knowledge, like in the previous step, you must begin with an emotionally stable frame-of-mind. With a higher risk or reward relying on the outcome of the event in question, the situation will become more emotionally charged, making emotional detachment more difficult, creating a reaction, rather than an action.

With this step-by-step of earning wisdom through experience, the question stands. Not all those who are experienced are wise, but is it possible to become wise without experience? How do you absorb the wisdom of lessons which you haven’t lived yourself?",Stoicism,1702468375.0,t3_18hf56u,0.57,1

Epictetus was a slave with severe punishment? 
Seneca being a general when nero was young it was said seneca was handling political affairs?

"Social media toxicity, R/vegan, and what should I do.","So I am recently new to Reddit, again. I was on reddit back in  2012 to 2014, but stopped until this year. I like how Reddit is mostly more positive, especially compared to the toxicity of Facebook. 
I have found great communities from books, dogs, satellite radio fans, to philosophy.
But something recently left a bad taste in my mouth. I am vegetarian and try mostly for a vegan diet due to my morality with animals. Not preaching this is just my personal beliefs, but I feel this is important information for the story.
So anyways I also joined R/vegan.
I posted a few times on the subreddit and recently I posted an article entitled ""Veganism is in crisis, and the fanatics can only blame themselves"" and asked what the people what they thought of the criticism. Just because I was curious. I did not write the article.
But I would say about 40% to 45% started to attack me personally or my online persona I guess.
I like to think I have tuff skin and shit posters and trolls don't bother me, but this time it kind of did.
I was just asking what people thoughts were and to start a discussion. I didn't give my opinion of the article and I have been posting on the board for awhile. 
But almost half of them seemed mad at me, I tried to defend myself, but they didn't seem to care. After a few responses I realized I was just wasting my time and deleted my post and blocked a few people. 
I had my wife look at the post and she says it did not look offensive or anything like that, but I do admit she could be biased.
I was really starting to like Reddit with the discussions. But R/vegan makes me question if I should give up social media in general. I don't know. 
I like the discussions, but I am getting to old to deal with shit posters all the time. I am not sure if this was a one time fluke, a vegan thing (I am not unrealistic, I know how they can be sometimes), a reddit thing, or just people...

How much mental energy or thought process does practicing Stoicism take up?,"BTW: I wasn't sure if I should be putting this in the ""New to Stoicism"" or in ""Seeking Stoic Advice"" - I've only been interested in Stoicism as a means for dealing with my own circumstances for the past year or so.

For some context: I struggle with the actual practicing of Stoicism, mostly due to having ADHD (mostly the Inattentive type).  Despite trying to work on it, I can often find the impulsive nature of my mind engages way too quickly.  If I'm in a 'hyperfocused' state regarding Stoicism, I can manage that a little better - but the effort it seems to take mentally is exhausting.

So:

I don't think I've seen this discussed - but how much time and effort is spent mentally going over the practice of being Stoic?  I am aware in CBT there are often things like half-hour daily exercises, but these are really more transformative things that are designed to work over longer periods.  To me, Stoicism is more a 'way of life' kind of philosophy and thinking - reacting to and interpreting situations and circumstances constantly.

That constant examination and practice seems exhausting to me.  I'm the kind of person who can become mentally exhausted after doing a client meeting, or having a slightly busier day, or just one of those days where my brain decides to inner monologue about anything and everything constantly.  Add to that all the little rules I have to follow otherwise I'll lose things, forget things and generally mess my day up horribly.  I often have to force myself to mono-task and try to keep focus even doing a simple thing like making a cup of tea or a sandwich.

This is all compounded by my seeing this quote of Epictetus: ""Don't explain your philosophy.  Embody it."" when I've been searching for some kind of guidance.  To me, to embody something is to take it on completely, utterly - it becomes ***everything***.

I guess alternatively - what is a good balance of applying Stoic principles in your mind over just letting things flow naturally to see how well the practices are taking hold? 

(In my life, and mind, if I'm not actively thinking about a process, then that process can very much not exist at all.  So coming into a situation where I *could* practice a Stoic principle, I'll forget that I can and instead do something else, and on reflection, something worse.)

I hope this makes sense, it's really hard for me to put down into words exactly what I'm trying to get across (and I'm sure I've probably missed some obvious point I should have made lol).",Stoicism,1702425079.0,t3_18h1dcc,0.74,7

I go to a deep placve in my mind where i overthink the situation and it effects my everyday life and how i am towards people sometimes. What can I do to improve here im trying my hardest but still seems kinda hard. Hope it makes sense

How do you practice not trying to get stressed out about things out of your control? Is that missing the point?,"I have a bumpy relationship with my mother. She frequently burns bridges with people and is generally negative and depressing to be around. She burned a bridge with my fiance last year, and generally has a bad relationship with my sister. This xmas we will all be spending it in separate locations (which is fine with me given the situation) but my mom is being super negative about it because she believes the 24th is ""her"" time to have us at her house. Long story short, shes tough to be around and pushes people away but still wants us to spend time with her.

I called her today to invite her to our house for xmas, since my sister would be away and I know my mom has no one else to spend xmas with (other than her husband and his family). She says she will be spending xmas with them and goes on a low key rant about how we won't be with her and how we don't want to go over to her house anymore, etc. I even tell her that we will plan to all be at her house next year, and she replies with ""yeah if im even alive next year"". Like, that is some straight up emotional abuse right there lol.

I dreaded calling her. I had anxiety thinking about the conversation. This is not right. I am not making any rash decisions because of this, in part thanks to stoicism. I understand this is out of my control and that I cannot change how she feels/acts/talks. The thing I don't like is still being stressed out about it. The dread. The anxiety. Am I missing the point of stoicism if I'm still trying to figure out how to remove those emotions?",Stoicism,1702417615.0,t3_18gxd92,0.67,2

The concept of virtue is circular,"Stoics advocate for following virtue, but what how might one define what is virtuous? A stoic would respond: ""that which results in your contentment/ what is in your nature.""   


The skeptic would rightly reply, ""what makes you content?""   


The Stoic would reply: ""That which uses the right reason""  


And on and on the circular reasoning goes. Without defining what contentment is or what the right reason is, this is a never ending circle and doesn't mean anything.   


Another counterargument: that which is just, wise, moderate and courageous is what makes you content.   


The skeptic would reply ""Why are those things virtues and not something else?"" And there is no answer.   


Finally, a Stoic might say something like: ""That which is good for you is the right use of reason""  


The skeptic would reply: ""But you just said that the only thing good for me is the right use of reason. If the only thing that is good is reason, then why is what is good for you the right use of reason? In other words, doing what is good is the right use of judgement, but you haven't actually defined what is good. Without defining what is good, then what makes it a good judgement?"" As you can see, there is circular reasoning once again.

I’m struggling to understand the stoic texts,"Per this sub I started reading the Dialogues of Epictetus. I just finished chapter one of book one and am very confused. 

Some of his sentences make total sense to me, but others are very confusing. For example, it starts off with “Of all the faculties, you will find not one which is capable of contemplating itself; and, consequently, not capable either of approving or disapproving.“ This just leaves me confused. What are all the faculties? He then gives the example of grammatic art and music as faculties that can’t contemplate themselves. And the “rational faculty” as the only one that can. I’m confused what specifically this even is.

I missed my convocation ceremony of my graduation. Everyone went there, and I couldn't. I slept. I have been oversleeping.

I have critical case of pectus arcuatum (horseshoe pectus) and doctor said that we have to get some scans so doctor can tell that it can be danger to my heart or not.

Stoicism and Hamas/Israel War,"All,

Struggling to approach the current war with the right philosophical mindset. 

I'm marginally Jewish and feel (largely due to being online, not familial) tied to the Israeli side. I view the Israelis as losing, by a large margin, the information war being fought online right now. (To clarify, I don't support their widespread bombing or cutting off food/water or the West Bank settlements, but I also don't support anyone whose ultimately goal is to kill or marginalize Jews.)

Why should the Stoic not be self indulgent?,"Hello all,

I am reading through Meditations for the first time and early on he mentions that one thing he learned from his adopted father was not to be too self indulgent and he admired that he had, “no concern for food, or the cut and color of his clothes, or having attractive slaves.”

My understanding is that stoicism teaches us how to better handle adversity and how to carry yourself in a way that others can respect. I don’t understand why caring about how you present yourself would negatively impact the Stoic. 

I agree that flaunting wealth or the material possessions you have as being anti stoic but I don’t see how private self indulgence is.",Stoicism,1702397545.0,t3_18gpgx6,0.67,6

Stoicism for giving birth,"
I'm going to be giving birth in a few weeks. What advice does Stoic philosophy have for me? Has anyone on here faced this experience and found Stoic perspectives helpful?

I plan to use pain medication in combination with other coping techniques - I find it most helpful personally to think of childbirth as lying along the spectrum of human experience that we can bring the resources of humanity (modern medicine!) to bear against, rather than a primal/natural event that my body will handle in a way separate from other parts of my life. (Dying is also part of the human experience, and people with a choice in the matter rarely form a goal of ""getting through it without unnatural interventions."") But I also understand that people feel many ways about this topic, and have a great admiration for people who pursue an unmedicated delivery - please don't make this post into a war about which of these approaches is ""more Stoic.""

Even though I expect to get an epidural, the education and medical advice I've gotten are consistent in recommending to delay epidurals until fairly late in the game (or at least it seems late to me) to avoid slowing labor. Epidurals can also fail or turn out to be unavailable for a variety of reasons. So I know I'm in for ??? hours of steadily increasing discomfort and pain, in an altered mental and hormonal state I haven't experienced before.  I also have never had my pain tolerance tested to an extreme degree, and know that pain tolerance and the experience of what labor feels like varies hugely. 

I vacilate between using voluntary discomfort as opportunities to practice not-suffering, and trying not to borrow worry/suffering from the future by going too nuts with it. I hold a lot of ice cubes and long yoga poses, and have access to good resources for specific mental management techniques for handling contractions.

Stoic perspectives have been very helpful to me during pregnancy, both for pregnancy symptoms (treatable and untreatable) and for thinking about upcoming labor.  There is a lot I can't control both about things that are inevitable (pain) and things that are unknowable (what complications arise, if I have back labor or require other medical interventions, if my epidural fails) - and it's very freeing to realize this means that me ruminating about it won't change anything. 

I don't have a significant formal background in stoic philosophy, so I'd be grateful for both your own impressions as well as specific topics, concept names, or readings that might be relevant. I am interested in any male or female perspectives on this question, so long as they don't amount to ""women just have some kind of special sauce for going through childbirth and they forget it afterward!""

Does stoic philosophy provide a justification for the holocaust?,"Good day all, I have this question that I have not been able to google and am keen to hear your opinions. That is, how would a stoic look at the holocaust? Epictetus says ""Things that are not within our own power, not without our Will, can by no means be either good or evil"". So if you were someone within the concentration camp, would you say that the holocaust was neither good nor evil and embrace it? 

He also says ""until you know their reasons, how do you know they’ve acted wrongly"". And the same applies here, if you do not know why a nazi did what he did, how do we say it was wrong? Just because he had orders to kill someone, does not mean there were not anterior motives, motives we are not aware of. 

Please let me know what you think. This community is well more versed in stoic philosophy than I.

Ps. I am of course not trying to justify the holocaust. I am very intrigued by the application of stoic philosophy in the most, to our standards, dire and horrific of scenarios. ",Stoicism,1702379851.0,t3_18gjnav,0.24,0

Is this stoicism or something else? Vanity?,"Life is suffering. To engage in life's pleasures is to cause more greater suffering later in life. To the contrary, to allow yourself to suffer and deal with the suffering of life in the present, softens the suffering later in life.

Example. People go on vacation and blow thousands of dollars instead of working or investing that money. They buy temporary happiness, but end up slaving for money for more of their life. To the contrary, someone who does not partake in these types of temporary happiness, save money and invest and can become financially free and reduce their suffering later in life by embracing the hard work and discipline it takes to focus on what is important; in this case that is financial freedom.

Stoicism - Reading the news or not?,"I've been involved with stoicism for about a year now. Reading books, listening to podcasts, watching videos etc. I feel like I have successfully applied rules and values to my life. I am definitely less angry, my short temper is gone, I'm able to smile more, I accept things for who or what they are, I generally feel better etc.

Recently, I had had a discussion with a friend of mine. He isn't as involved in stoicism, but he knows what it is and it's core values.

He asked me about an event that happened in the world, and I told him I wasn't aware of it, because I don't read the news. He asked why, and I told him that the news make me angry, thus I avoid it. Although, I still read news I find interesting that doesn't upset me, like technology and some entertainment news.

He told me that he can read the news and not get angry, and stay neutral regardless of what he's reading. That's definitely not me. The news themselves, and how the media stirs the pot and presents the news, it's a breeding ground for anger. So I avoid it, and in return I'm happier, with the blowback of not staying as informed about the world (which can be a blessing and a curse).

My friend told me that a TRUE stoic, would be able to read any news and stay neutral, and me avoiding the news isn't what a stoic person should do. A stoic person should block out external things while staying informed. He argued that I should train myself to read the news, whatever it is, and stay neutral.

This intrigued me. It felt like a superpower. But me training myself by reading negative news, and forcing myself to stay neutral, sounds awful. I mean, how long would that take?

But first let's get the definition down here. Local news headline: 8-year-old girl sexually assaulted by 3 men. Alright… Do I smash things around me? No. But I carry this news with me in the back of my head, and it's there, making me angrier than I should have been if I didn't read it. It can affect my entire day.

I don't see how a person could read that and stay neutral? In fact, that out right sounds like a psychopath.

What do you think?

EDIT: So many incredible comments. I wasn't expecting to get so dwelled down into stoic theory. This was great. 

Based on a lot of your comments as well as stoic theory, I'm guessing my friend is correct. However, flooding myself with negatiity just to stay informed about world events; isn't something I see as something good. 

Also important to mention is the fact that one news article doesn't upset me, or make me angry, despite the original post making it look like that. I'm talking about watching and reading general media news on a daily basis, and over months or years building a negative mindset. I can read a bad piece of news and brush it off. Should have made that more clear from the start.

I've been heavily informed, and I have been heavily uninformed (current state), and based on my mood and life in general, I prefer to be uninformed. Not MISINFORMED, but UNINFORMED. Reading up in current local news is a good thing. Reading up what happens on the other side of the world does no longer interest me.

What would the stoics have thought about eating animals in modern day?,"After reading meditations, it's clear that Marcus Aurelius was focused on living within his own nature as a human being, and valued the humans ability to reason above everything.

On one hand, eating meat is human nature, we are clearly omnivores and have eaten meat as a species for as long as we've been around. 
However in modern day, eating meat isn't a requirement to live a healthy life, and the mass production of meat is widely thought to be inefficient and cruel, so using reason and the information we have available, eating meat wouldn't be the virtuous choice.

I've just been thinking about this lately, and thought there was a bit of a clash between our nature and our ability to reason in this area.

Stoicism doesn’t account for the unvirtuous motivations of beneficial behavior,"Many criticisms of stoicism are based upon faulty logic or misunderstandings, but one criticism that has always stuck with me is stoicism seems to underestimate is the heavy influence of unvirtuous motivations to drive positive behaviour.

Stoicism emphasizes the importance of a proper perspective, and valuing virtue above all else. Typically it is seen as unvirtuous to allow your emotions to control you, to allow yourself to stress unnecessarily, or to pursue things like sex, status or ego. 

However, modern psychology indicates these are humanities strongest motivators.  Thus, the closer to a sage you become, the more you eliminate these motivators, and the less productive of a citizen you will become, which ends up defeating a large part of being stoic in the first place. 

You can argue: “To stoics the only thing that matters is you are virtuous.” Would it be virtuous to decline a method which allow you can help fellow man more? Is it not selfish to reject the ability to care more because it harms you more?",Stoicism,1702278563.0,t3_18fos0s,0.42,0
Question about one’s own nature,"Hello,

I was contemplating about the fact that people can have their own ""natures"". For instance, I find that my nature is to provide for a family by having a job and loving/providing for them. Because of that, I studied and got a job to make that happen. 

I find my nature to be virtuous because I’m also serving society and whatnot, but then I thought I probably am biased in my line of thinking. 

I thought of a scenario where a person thinks that not working and not serving society is what nature demands of them due to any hypothetical reason (maybe they think society has failed them and that the right thing to do is to act against it). In that case, doing the opposite of what I thought was virtuous would become the virtuous thing to do for this person.

Is my thought on the right track? Or are there established guidelines for one’s nature to be virtuous? I thought of this after reminding myself of how Diogenes was praised by some stoic philosophers in some aspects (like in the famous banquet analogy).",Stoicism,1702266825.0,t3_18flmnz,0.99,5
What are some modern stoic texts you can recommend?,"When I was in 7th grade I read “The seven habits of highly effective people.” I didn’t know it at the time, but that was my first exposure to many of the stoic principles. A couple years later I read “Man’s search for meaning” and that book deeply moved me and taught me so much about the core of stoicism. In 11th grade I read “The Tao of Pooh” and used that book as a my personal spiritual guidebook until I discovered stoicism. When I was introduced to stoicism by the book “a guide to the good life” I felt like I had found a way of living that brought together the fundamental principles that had inspired and spoken to me throughout my life. I still consider myself very new to stoicism as it has only been a year and half since I started seriously studying it. Even so, one of my favorite things to do is to look for parallels in the works of the ancient stoics and that of other books I read, especially fiction. 

What are some modern (as in post enlightenment) texts that you find to be deeply stoic texts? Not stoic commentaries, but actual stand alone projects that teach or demonstrate the principles found within stoicism?",Stoicism,1702252449.0,t3_18fh1r1,0.92,33

"Self sufficiency over virtue, initially","I've been revisiting a piece in the Discourses http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0236%3Atext%3Ddisc%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D9,  and I know that ""self sufficiency is the greatest of all wealth"" is Epicurean(I think), and wealth is an indifferent in Stoicism?, but..

""..But a man may say, Whence shall I get bread to eat when I have nothing?""...""Wretch, if you have it, you will have it; if you have it not, you will depart from life...""

Somewhere in that section Epictetus calls some animals irrational and cowardly and then regards them at the same time for being self sufficient and living according to nature. I've heard that the success rate of a hunt for lions in our African wilderness is about 25% and many of them die from starvation. But when they succeed, they roar without reply and ravage without resistance.  I've also heard that tigers are pretty unremorseful. 

""...But we think about ourselves, as if we were only stomachs, and intestines, and shameful parts; we fear, we desire; we flatter those who are able to help us in these matters, and we fear them also...""

""..And shall it be necessary for one among us who is a philosopher to travel into foreign parts, and trust to and rely on others, and not to take care of himself, and shall he be inferior to irrational animals...""

It's coming off alittle like ""do it yourself, do what you have to do to survive..or atleast do what your nature requires in that given context because even actions which appear to be—and indeed are—immoral or unjust advance the overall design, which taken as a whole is harmonious and

One major change and some minor changes to the subreddit,"Howdy, we have decided on the small handful of changes described below.

\- **The New Agora**  
In order to better ensure that users seeking Stoic advice receive well-informed, specifically Stoic responses, we have decided to make a major change in the subreddit. Posts with the ""Seeking Stoic Advice"" flair will now be considered as seeking specifically and recognizably Stoic advice. Users who are seeking and offering personal opinions inspired by Stoicism, sharing experiences that may be influenced by Stoicism, or requesting and attempting to administer ""[first aid](https://modernstoicism.com/two-types-of-stoic-therapy-by-john-sellars/)"" will be welcome to do so in the New Agora, a daily pinned thread for these and other types of exchanges (including, for example, casual questions users don't want create posts for and extremely limited self-promotion). The New Agora is not an anything-goes thread; instead, it is for things that may be more tangentially, rather than directly, Stoic. Activity that is way off-base remains unwelcome.  
If your ""Seeking Stoic Advice"" post is removed because you are seeking personal opinions or asking what-would-you-do questions, you may instead post in the New Agora. 

\- **User flairs**  
In the interest of improving communication, we have decided to implement user flairs. In order to receive a user flair, message the moderators with your request. Pending our consensus, informed by our review of your activity, our background knowledge, and/or other factors, we will assign the flair and it will appear beside your username when you are active here. You may apply for flairs in accordance with the most suitable descriptors of your experience or interest. For example, flairs may include ""qualified/trustworthy user,"" ""academic/scholar,"" or ""προκόπτων."" The moderators may also decide to grant flairs to users on their own, without applications in mod messages, pending the user's agreement.

\- **Post flairs**  
As mentioned, the ""Seeking Stoic Advice"" flair is now strictly for seeking well-informed advice strictly drawing from and clearly aligned with Stoic philosophy.The ""Stoic Theory/Study"" flair will now only be assigned by moderators. If you would like to use this flair on your post, use the ""Pending Theory/Study"" flair. This will flag our attention, and we will review your post to determine whether to assign the ""Stoic Theory/Study"" flair. This is intended to prevent the misuse of the flair that is primarily meant for longform, well-informed, and careful posts, rather than pop-philosophy-type content, short personal observations, and newcomer questions.

Things may change, but we are going to move forward and monitor how well things work. If you have any questions, concerns, or other feedback, feel free to let us know.

EVERYTHING that happens is preordained,"I feel anxious. I have to give a presentation tomorrow and I feel anxious. But that's not what worries me. What worries me is the very fact that I am anxious. I have read meditations hundreds of times, I shouldn't feel this way. I should be armed with the thought that nothing in the universe can happen that is bad, because what the universe creates is guided by the laws of logic and cannot be anything but good.

The problem here is with the ""should"". You simultaneously say that the universe cannot give way to something that is bad but at the same time say that what is happening right now is wrong. The universe is wrong, in this case. Everything that the universe has so far created, the big bang, the birth of humanity, the rise of democracy, have been good and without mistake - until today. You being anxious is the universe's first mistake.

Of course this makes no sense. By ""everything that happens is good"" it follows that your anxiety has to be good. If tomorrow you should feel so anxious that you throw up, that is good. A central problem with this line of thinking has to do with expectation. ""I feel like I have done everything right so I shouldn't be feeling this way."" The hardest part, I think, is truly letting go of this expectation. We practice philosophy or spiritualism or religion because we want to be happy but often it is this goal that gets in the way of that happiness. You will still keep practicing, but remember that it is not up to you how things will go or how you will feel. Feeling bad can be a symptom of a problem that you should try to fix but it is not the feeling itself that you should try to fix or even bother with at all.

On descriptions and prescriptions,"**Introduction**

I’m sure everyone already intuitively knows the difference between prescriptions and descriptions, and can easily explain the difference when asked to. Yet quite often I see people on here struggle to apply this distinction in their Stoic practice.

In this post I will attempt to show this distinction in the context of practicing Stoicism and how one can practice more effectively by keeping it in mind.

**The difference**

The definitions of the words as per the Cambridge dictionary:

Prescription:

>the act of telling someone else what they must have or do.

Description:

>something that tells you what something or someone is like.

In my own understanding, a description is a list of characteristics that is associated with someone or something whereas a prescription is a list of instructions you can follow. We can easily *describe* how it is like for a master musician to play on an instrument, but to *prescribe* the training to attain such skills is a completely different thing.

In the context of training, a description tells you the goal that you wish to attain, and a prescription tells you the process towards  attaining that goal. In the causality chain of events, a description is the consequence and a prescription is an antecedent cause.

What this means is it makes sense to use prescriptions as your practice but not descriptions, and this is really where I see people struggle with.

Consider this simple example. If you sprain an ankle, the description of a “recovered ankle” is “you can run”. Do you then “run” with the sprained ankle so that you match the description of a “recovered ankle”? Of course not, we all have enough common sense to know this is ridiculous. What you do is ""following the doctor’s treatment plan”, or the “prescription”, until “you can run”, at which point you know you have “recovered” because what you can do matches the description. Being able to run is caused by having recovered, which in turn is caused by following the treatment plan.

But “running to recover” is exactly what people are doing when they say something along the lines of “I’m practicing Stoicism by not being disturbed by externals”, or “I’m following the Stoic principle of the cardinal virtues”. Not being disturbed by externals and the virtues are *descriptions* of a practiced Stoic, they are not *prescriptions* for your practice.

Epictetus himself talked about this in the following excerpt:

>But if he has striven merely to attain the state which he finds in his books and works only at that, and has made that the goal of his travels, I bid him go home at once and not neglect his concerns there, since the goal to which he has travelled is nothing; but not so that other goal—to study how a man may rid his life of sorrows and lamentations, and of such cries as ""Woe is me!"" and ""Wretch that I am!"" and of misfortune and failure, and to learn the meaning of death, exile, prison, hemlock; that he may be able to say in prison, ""Dear Crito, if so it pleases the gods, so be it,"" rather than, ""Alas, poor me, an old man, it is for this that I have kept my grey hairs!""

\- The Discourses of Epictetus I.4

I believe this confusion is primarily caused by being introduced to the Meditations as their first Stoic reading material, which brings me to my next point.

**How it applies to the original texts**

As I mentioned just now, I’d bet my money on the Meditations being the primary cause of this confusion. That’s because the Meditations is mostly *descriptive,* there are very few passages in there I can think of that are actually *prescriptive.*

We need to remember, that Marcus had had decades of Stoic training when he wrote it - he was already one of the most well-versed Stoics in human history; and the Meditations was not written to teach others to be like him – it was his private journal. A master guitarist doesn’t need to write down in his journal where to place his fingers on the guitar, he will probably write something like “a 1-minute solo would fit nicely in this segment of this song”.

The Discourses of Epictetus is by far the most *prescriptive* book out of all the remaining original Stoic texts we have. Epictetus is also quite explicit whenever he states his instructions if you read it carefully. Even Marcus himself implied the importance of this book in his Stoic education on the very first page of the Meditations:

>7. From Rusticus: to get an impression of need for reform and treatment of character; not to run off into zeal for rhetoric, writing on speculative themes, discoursing on edifying texts, exhibiting in fanciful colours the ascetic or the philanthropist. To avoid oratory, poetry, and preciosity; not to parade at home in ceremonial costume or to do things of that kind; to write letters in the simple style, like his own from Sinuessa to my mother. To be easily recalled to myself and easily reconciled with those who provoke and offend, as soon as they are willing to meet me. To read books accurately and not be satisfied with superficial thinking about things or agree hurriedly with those who talk round a subject. **To have made the acquaintance of the** ***Discourses*** **of Epictetus, of which he allowed me to share a copy of his own.**

\- The Meditations, book I

There is another anecdotal evidence of this book being a primary education material to the ancient Stoics:

>With these words then the Stoic rid himself of the rich Asiatic. But later, when we were approaching Brundisium and sea and sky were calm, I asked him what the reason for his fear was, which he had refused to reveal to the man who had improperly addressed him. And he quietly and courteously replied: “Since you are desirous of knowing, hear what our forefathers, the founders of the Stoic sect, thought about that brief but inevitable and natural fear, or rather,” said he, “read it, for if you read it, you will be the more ready to believe it and you will remember it better.” **Thereupon before my eyes he drew from his little bag the fifth book of the** ***Discourses*** **of the philosopher Epictetus, which, as arranged by Arrian, undoubtedly agree with the writings of Zeno and Chrysippus.**

\- Aulus Gellius’ The Attic Nights

It should be abundantly clear at this point that the Discourses of Epictetus was amongst the most important Stoic learning materials at the time, and the people back then also had access to the works  of other prominent Stoic figures such as Zeno and Chrysippus. We are fortunate enough to still have access to this book in modern times (albeit half of it is lost), there is simply no reason we shouldn’t follow what the ancients did by using it as our main educational text.

Seneca’s letters and essays are also a decent source of instructional texts. The problem is his love of verbal barrage (he was a famous playwright at the time) means his writings are often very long-winded and in my opinion excessively sophisticated for the purpose of education.

I find his writings more poetic than they are educational, and I often find myself lost in a sort of “trance” when reading his texts, especially his essays. I still struggle to keep track of Seneca’s points when reading his essays to this day.

To me reading Seneca is something I do more for “reading pleasure” for a lack of better words than for learning. Of course that’s just me, if you have a different experience with reading Seneca then by all means do it as part of your learning.

**How we apply it in our Stoic practice**

A marathon runner and a sprinter both share the same goal of being the best at their sport, and thus to train their body to be at its physical peak in the most suitable way for their sport. But the marathon runner is primarily concerned with endurance whereas the sprinter speed. As such their training regimes have to be different.

It is also the case for our Stoic practice. Each of us has a different purpose, a different role to play in the cosmopolis; each of us has a different upbringing, different strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, how we train ourselves in the way of the Stoics must by necessity be different. Again I will quote Epictetus on this same point here:

>I am inclined to pleasure; I will betake myself to the opposite side of the rolling ship, and that beyond measure, so as to train myself. I am inclined to avoid hard work; I will strain and exercise my sense-impressions to this end, so that my aversion from everything of this kind shall cease. For who is the man in training? He is the man who practises not employing his desire, and practises employing his aversion only upon the things that are within the sphere of his moral purpose, yes, and practises particularly in the things that are difficult to master. **And so different men will have to practise particularly to meet different things**.

\- The Discourses of Epictetus III.12

**Conclusion**

In summary, if you wish to make progress in your Stoic training, it is important that you set yourself a description as a goal and devise a prescriptive plan to train yourself towards attaining that goal.

Don’t just start with a far-fetched goal like “I want to be like Marcus Aurelius!”. That’s like watching [a video of Van Halen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULEBSxP725w) and immediately saying “I want to play the guitar like him”, or reading about theoretical Physics for the first time and saying ""I want to win a Nobel prize in Physics!""

Start with something small and managable, something like “I want to stop being a slave to material wealth” if this is one of your weaknesses, then proceed to train yourself to get accustomed to a life with minimal material possessions.

It is also crucial that you are completely honest with yourself about your shortcomings, and be fully committed to follow the plan you devise, in the same vein you have to be completely honest with your doctor about your symptoms and follow her treatment plan if you want to recover most effectively from your illness.

P.S. If this post reads like another “Drop the freaking Meditations and pick up the bloody Discourses of Epictetus”, that’s because it probably is.",Stoicism,1702104495.0,t3_18e7n8l,0.92,28
I am affected by what is currently happening in Gaza.,"I feel like nothing makes any sense anymore. How can people sleep comfortably knowing that their fellow human beings are experiencing genocide and children and innocent people are being killed? I feel guilty for having the privilege and resources to achieve my goals, for being able to buy meals, for having a roof over my head. I feel guilty about living. I am so sad for the people suffering and it's out of my control.

**\*\*\*READ THIS\*\*\***

Just because I specifically mentioned Gaza doesn't mean I am not compassionate toward other races and countries too. What is wrong with some of you? I pity both the innocent people of Israel and Palestine. I am also saddened by what has happened in both Ukraine and Russia. I HAVE EMPATHY FOR ALL HUMAN KINDS AND RACES. Why are you all assuming the other way? I DESPISE ALL FORMS OF EVIL. I am not siding with any side; I am against the people who are in charge behind all of this cruelty and those who support these actions.

Just because something worse happened in other countries doesn't mean we shouldn't stand up for other countries too. I don't know wtf happened to compassion. Why can't we all just be fvcking kind.

Here's what's currently happening in Gaza:

"STOIC ADVISE (or anything else) FOR EMBRACING COMMITMENT AND STAY DETERMINED IN SOMETHING ""MEANINGFUL""","I was a really pathetic (and still am till date, but a bit better) until I started watching and reading Stoic philosophy. I am quite introverted and I am 10th standard. I am trying to come to the point: I don't know what I should achieve. My dad and other family members are putting too much hope on me to do something big. To be honest, I don't have any ambition in particular and I am a quite average guy.

I am quite overwhelmed and just want to live a simple, peaceful life. At the same time, I want to know that how exactly capable of doing particular stuff. To make it clear, I don't have any talent. So, I am not getting a single reason for self-improvement and having better days. I am too chill to be human! The worse part is that I suffer a lot from COGNITIVE DISSONANCE. Day by day, I am losing my all emotional feelings.

I thew away something of sentimental value by mistake. How can I move on?,"This is embarrassing to say, but… it’s a piece of intimate clothing, and it reminds me of a certain person because… yeah. I could’ve prevented the mistake by spending 5-10 seconds to check, but I didn’t. I chucked it down the rubbish chute I think :’) 

it’s a piece of clothing, and it wasn’t expensive, but I guess I’m sad because I can never get the moment back. Also, I’m no longer in contact with this person for various reasons. Also, it was a pretty dumb mistake.

I acknowledge that part of why I’m so obsessed + unable to move on is due to OCD… but I’m looking to tackle it from a stoic’s perspective as well.

"What are the acceptable sources for ""personal merit""?","I've been reading Epictetus and he says "" 
Personal merit cannot be derived from an external source. It is not to be found in your personal associations, nor can it be found in the regard of other people. It is a fact of life that other people, even people who love you, will not necessarily agree with your ideas, understand you, or share your enthusiasms""

From my perspective, i am interested specifically in the first part talking about merit and he seems to me, to be talking about merit in regards to achievement or the desire for achievement. 

Epictetus lists all the sources NOT for personal merit.

Is there any advice from Epictetus or any other stoic greats regarding acceptable sources of obtaining ""personal merit""?

How do I deal with people hating me,"So I’ve recently joined this new school. Long story short, this girl is convinced that I’ve been spreading rumours about her and I genuinely haven’t. I’ve tried speaking to her and telling her that she is mistaken, but she doesn’t want to hear it. She’s now decided to never speak to me again and her whole friend group hate me. I know it’s childish, but it bothers me that people don’t like me, and whenever I’m around that particular group, Im overly conscious and my energy is off. It’s getting so bad that I even think about it before I go sleep and the minute I wake up. I don’t understand why I’m feeling like this, and I don’t know how to cope with it. I would love to talk it out with this girl, but that isn’t really an option as she told me to “never show my face to her again”. So now I feel like these people are just going to forever hate me and there’s nothing I can do about it.

Has anyone enrolled in the college of stoic philosophers?,"I finished Chris Fisher’s podcast and I’ve revisited some of the episodes. He mentioned the college of stoic philosophers a couple times and as someone who has always looked down on all these courses that are offered online (usually how to make quick money), this one is obviously different. So much content is available online these days for free but I wouldn’t mind paying to have a mentor. Anyway I decided to check it out anyway and to my surprise it’s only $100 tuition which is really nothing. Anyway you have to submit an essay (I’m an engineer by background and don’t remember the last time I wrote an essay) along with $100 to submit your application.

A Brief Gratitude for Stoicism,"I am from a developing country. If people from the developed world can be... well, untrustworthy, politically polarized, immature, horrible and so on, think developed world - economy and institutions and live with that for the rest of your life. I write this on every post in general so I think this has become essentially a part of my internet identity (and not my oh-so-glamorous IRL identity, unless I see discrimination here) 

So when I'm very grateful for Stoicism and the dichotomy of control. I've read and re-read original stoic texts countless times, with pencils and highlighting and all that good stuff. I would not claim I am an expert but if I've almost a decade of experience with 7 Habits of Effective People, I think I already have had a good introduction to Stoicism. Even the ""later"" stoics (big 3) abandoned stoic physics & stoic logic and just concerned themselves with stoic ethics (Discipline of Action) for the most part.

Stoicism as a school did not survive. But oh my god if we did not have the basic ability to focus on what is up to us (or ""control"") and did not have the ancient authors basically contributing to modern psychotherapy and science... I personally don't know how I'd deal with all the pressure and all my personal demons.

So thanks. I'm practically a first generation lawyer and hopefully will work as a District & Sessions judge before retirement. I think I'll never be called ""Justice <name>"" but that's perfectly fine. So, yeah, thank god for the good people behind stoicism and this sub. Even in this sub itself, things get pretty non-stoic and meta... but I think that's to be expected considering we're all humans and imperfect, like Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius and Cicero. 

So thank god for all the Stoic podcasts, authors, translators, and simply fellow students of this philosophy for sharing very good information with me. The first and foremost principle in Stoicism is the principle of Justice (a virtue) and personally I'd have gone crazy with my unorthodox lifestyle and unconventional life story if it weren't for Stoicism and related philosophies. So, thank you, fellow Stoics, for existing!",Stoicism,1701976565.0,t3_18d32ob,0.67,2
Life is suffering,"It is my understanding that the Stoics, similar to the Buddhists, advocate accepting that there is a certain amount of suffering in life.  I believe the Buddhists even say that life **IS** suffering.  Instead of waiting and being put off kilter by life's obstacles, the Stoics advocate premeditatio malorum, a kind of meditation on the negativity that might come your way in a given day.

&#x200B;

I don't use that morning meditation every day.  I tend to remember it when things in my life are trending downward; that's when I'm usually grasping at whatever tools I have to make my life better.  I do find it useful.

&#x200B;

More importantly, for me, is the mere acceptance or acknowledgment that my life circumstances are exactly as they must be, warts and all.  I have some influence, but I cannot control them.   Life cannot be without suffering, so I need to accept it as it is. 

&#x200B;

Similarly too, both the Stoics and Buddhist believe that reality itself is neutral, in terms of its significance, but that it's our judgments about the reality that can cause us to suffer.  I am continually having to remind myself of this truth when I go down the rabbit hole of negativity.

&#x200B;

Being more accepting of life's struggles means less suffering  because I'm not constantly craving what isn't.

&#x200B;

I'm a novice student of Stoicism and Buddhism, so I would appreciate any comments that clarify or even correct what I'm trying to say.

What is the point of this sub if not to help others?,"I’ve been on this sub for some time now and during my time here I’ve seen many including myself complain about posts seeking advice for their particular situation.

But what is the point of this sub if not to help others gain a better understanding of the philosophy through application and experience? Do you think the original teachers weren’t bombarded themselves with others seeking advice? What is it Marcus Aurelius said? “Be strict with yourself and patient with others”. Something along those lines. Where’s the patience? 

I often need outside help because I’m burdened with social disorders that make it difficult for me to understand situations as they are as opposed to how I view them personally. And that’s often difficult for me to separate. Of course with time I’ve grown in my patience and give myself the space I need to think things through, but I certainly needed as much help as I could get not even 6 months ago.

"If you want to improve, reject such reasonings as these: ""If I neglect my affairs, I'll have no income...","> If you want to improve, reject such reasonings as these: ""If I neglect my affairs, I'll have no income; if I don't correct my servant, he will be bad."" For it is better to die with hunger, exempt from grief and fear, than to live in affluence with perturbation; and it is better your servant should be bad, than you unhappy. 

Regarding [this passage](https://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html), I'm feeling a bit lost. 

As the income earner and as a parent it's my duty to provide for my family, but that means not neglecting my affairs -- especially financially.

And it is true that if I don't go to work, do a good job, maintain a career and such we may find ourselves with no income and no place to live.

Reference for a quote,"I have stumbled upon this wonderful quote of Marcus Aurelius:

Being in your late teens and early 20s,"So, we get a very steady stream of posts here along the lines of “I’m 18-25 and I don’t know what to do with my life, don’t understand why I haven’t achieved anything yet, don’t understand why the world seems so bleak and pointless, etc”.

The reason is that you’re 18-25. That period of life is exactly when you question everything, as you come out of childhood and start to work out how to be an adult. This is, in short, a very normal way to feel and a very normal process to go through. 

Don’t be afraid. Let the questions present themselves and allow yourself time to find the answers. Very very VERY few people have things figured out at this stage. Be patient and calm, and allow yourself to be young and still learning. It’s ok not to know what you’re doing yet.

Some questions from senecas on shortness of life,"From on shortness of life

""Vices assail and surround us on all sides, and they don’t allow  us to rise again and lift our eyes to the clear discernment of truth;  but they press down on them, keeping them lowered and ﬁ xed on  mere desire. It’s never possible for their victims to return to their  true selves. If by chance they ever ﬁ nd some respite, they still roll  restlessly, just like the deep sea, which still swells even after the wind  has settled; they never ﬁ nd full relaxation from their desires""



Q.1The way he said""It’s never possible for their victims to return to their  true selves""
I felt like it isn't possible even after they quoted the vices




""Look  back and recall when you were ever sure of your purpose; how few  days turned out as you’d intended; when you were ever at your own  disposal; when your face showed its own expression; when your mind  was free from disturbance; what accomplishment you can claim in  such a long life; how many have plundered your existence without  your being aware of what you were losing; how much time has been  lost to groundless anguish, foolish pleasure, greedy desire, the charms  of society; how little is left to you from your own store of time. You’ll  come to realize that you’re dying before your time.”



Q.2 The part ""how few  days turned out as you’d intended""

Wow just came back here after a few years.

I keep having intrusive thoughts imagining of her enjoying life with her current partner, doing things we used to do together, having sex, etc.

I rediscovered stoicism recently and tried to apply some stoic principles to my situation. I understand that my feelings of jealousy and betrayal come from a misunderstanding of reality. I don’t own or control this person, she is free to do whatever she wants and I should not base my happiness/life on her presence in my life. But I just can’t change how I feel. I also can’t treat this like a learning opportunity, or to become a better person, because I don’t want that.

Should I forgive no matter what?,"Hello everyone, i’m relatively new to stoicism although I have been looking into stoic views for some time now. I am having trouble trying to decide the best course of action for my own mental and for my sports team regarding forgiveness of a teamate. A player on this sports team that I will call Jake brings down the entire team. Not just in a bad attitude towards the game way but in an instigator with his own teammates way. Jake and I were previously pretty close friends even spending some time together outside of our sport. Until Jake started being such a douche that I called him out for it. If you can’t tell yet, Jake isn’t the type of guy to appreciate being called out in front of his peers. We butted heads for many months but never let it affect us on the field. Recently it had gotten much worse as jake said cruel things to my face, gotten physical with me and my belongings/equipment, and tried to convince teamates I didn’t belong on the team. Now I am a pretty level headed guy, I didn’t let this affect me as I felt sorry for him because he is obviously lacking in some department to have to go after someone like this. What I refused to let happen was my image with others be tampered and for Jake to affect the chemistry of the team where it affects us in game play. During this period I looked at stoicism for guidance and I think I did the right thing. Not once did I raise my voice at Jake, lay my hands on jake, or even talk badly about jake to others. I reasoned that Jake is feeling a certain way and needs to take it out on others. 

Now I will skip some time and get to the part where i need advice. Jake came up to me personally and grabbed my hand shaking it and said “i’m sorry for being such a bad teammate, im working on it” I didn’t say “It’s okay” as being a bad teammate is not okay but i thanked him for his apology. My question is, in stoic principle should I be accepting Jake back into my life as a friend?",Stoicism,1701924045.0,t3_18cnmvp,0.69,5

My criticism of Stoicism,"My criticism has to do with the emphasis that the ancient stoic sages gave to various virtues. Early stoicism was greatly influenced by Socratic piety and its virtue ethics of justice, temperance, courage, and wisdom. Aristotelian ethics also greatly influenced the stoics. Aristotle proposed the following nine virtues: wisdom, prudence, justice, fortitude, courage, liberality, magnificence, magnanimity, and temperance. 

Absent in these virtues and the stoic writings is the virtue of agape. This is a selfless, unconditional love that transcends romantic or familial love. This love is central to Christian theology. The core texts on this love are the sermon on the mount, attributed to Jesus, and the writing of the apostle Paul. 

A parallel to agape or “Christian love” can be found in eastern wisdom traditions as well. In Buddhism, especially the Theravada tradition, they emphasize Metta or the cultivation of boundless, unconditional love and goodwill toward all living beings.

Now the stoics did emphasize benevolence and kindness towards others, but the conception of agape is never a central part of the stoic ethic. I consider myself a novice practicing stoic, and have found that as I continue to learn and grow, my practice of virtue has been improved as I have worked to prioritize the development of agape.",Stoicism,1701914706.0,t3_18ckotn,0.69,6

"""Each man is as wretched as he has convinced himself he is.""","I've just started reading The Practicing Stoic by Ward Farnsworth.  The full quote of Seneca, in the book, is (p. 39 of the Kindle version) ""'Everything depends on opinion.  Ambition, luxury, greed, all look back to opinion.  it is according to opinion that we suffer.  Each man is as wretched as he has convinced himself he is.  Seneca, Epistles 78. 13.'""  When I first read this Stoic sentiment a couple years ago it was like an epiphany.  What do you mean that my/other's judgments about life and about me are not Truth.  They are just impermanent opinions holding no inherent value or weight.  That I somehow had the power to choose a different interpretation of the so-called facts was a revelation.

Prior to that, and other readings I was doing, I was so unconscious that I was often-times ensnared by my thinking, believing it was my reality (even when objective facts contradicted my thoughts); instead of being aware of the thinker, with the power to change my thoughts, or to not think at all, i.e., meditate or be mindful.

Now I wish I could say that I no longer get ensnared by my thoughts, which in turn can get me down, but at least now I'm more quickly able to intercede and question the runaway thoughts.  Thank goodness for the philosophers to help us lead a more meaningful life.",Stoicism,1701898132.0,t3_18cernq,0.96,36
Stoicism can be a replacement for therapy,"Around my house I can fix things like leaky faucets and dead vacuums, but if a problem brings me close to electrical main lines I call an electrician. I'm happy to do it, but I'd never call him over to change a light bulb---it's faster, cheaper, better for me to do it myself. Some people are more handy than me and can build a house, others can't flip a breaker.

So it is with stoicism---and most moral philosophies---and mental health. Problems of the mind are the stuff of life; we all try to fix destructive behavior, figure out life goals, cope with grief, reconcile a traumatic event, and more. Sometimes the problem is small, sometimes it's big. A big problem faced by a young man whose seen little of the world and has no philosophy calls for talking to someone. A small problem faced by a woman steeped in a good philosophy is nothing for her to handle on her own. 

I've had my share of hardship, and stoic ideas often kept my mind right. Its not hard for me to think of a world where I hadn't pored over this philosophy and so found myself needing help.

I would never say that ""stoicism"" is always a replacement to talking with someone, but it can be. It has been.",Stoicism,1701897875.0,t3_18ceo0z,0.42,0
Stoicism and art?,"Just finished Meditiations for the first time, and I could only find one brief passage about the relationship between Marcus and art. In one passage, can’t remember which one, MA mentioned music, and how if one were to break down a piece into each one of its notes, they could not affect him on their own. From this combined with Marcus telling himself to stop reading books, I infer that he does not believe that art is “good.” While Marcus did ‘cite’ several plays and literary works, this was the only passage I could find in direct relation to it so if someone can find more I would appreciate it.
Here is my core dilemma: I understand that one of the base precepts of stoicism is to not indulge in pleasures. To only seek clarity of the mind and to do the right thing for humanity, as your nature demands of you.  If this is the case, however, how does one justify the pursuit of beauty and art, or in our modern era entertainment such as movies and TV?",Stoicism,1701897873.0,t3_18ceo04,0.67,1

Is resilience necessary?,"In a conversation here today, the idea of resilience was discussed and it was put to me that resilience is an important thing in Stoicism. I agreed at the time, but on reflection I wonder whether I was wrong. 

The word resilient has always suggested something springy to me, a surface which can be struck and bounce back, like a sapling or a good mattress. In humans, resilience is the ability to weather difficulty and recover from adversity. 

However, the Sage does not experience anything she considers adversity. Winds blow but they do not push her back. Correctly judging all circumstances, she has no need to be resilient because she experiences no suffering. 

Of course none of us are a Sage, but I wonder if resilience is the wrong thing for a student of Stoicism to strive towards. If we are affected enough to need resilience, presumably there is a flaw in our reasoning which needs to be addressed.

Seneca - is there 20 books comprising letters to lucilius,"Hi 

So I'm reading letters of seneca and I have been fascinated by the legend and I thought of reading further more about him, 
I asked chat gpt how many books are there from seneca

And this was the output ! So is there actually each letters from penguin Classics are written in a bigger format as in 20 books? Or am I missing any information? 

Certainly! Seneca's ""Letters to Lucilius"" (Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium) are commonly organized into 20 books. Each ""book"" contains a set of letters, and in total, there are 124 letters. 

Here's a simplified breakdown of the organization:

Books 1-9: These books contain the majority of the letters, with each book consisting of a varying number of letters addressing different philosophical topics and life advice.Books 10-12: These books include letters on various subjects, continuing the themes of earlier books.

Books 13-16: These books are sometimes considered separately as ""On Groundless Fears,"" as they primarily focus on dealing with fears and anxieties.

Books 17-20: These books contain the final set of letters, exploring various Stoic principles and life lessons.",Stoicism,1701881816.0,t3_18c8e29,0.67,1

Stoicism helps with depression,"
I will never make the claim that Stoicism is a tried and true ""cure"" to depression and/or suicidal ideation. However, I know that the lessons I personally have learned through philosophy as a whole, and Stoicism in particular, have helped me grow a lot in the last few months.

I have my low days still but I have learned how to face those thoughts and feelings from a far more practical view by changing my judgement. Every day I make the choice to allow those thoughts to run rampant or challenge them by seeing them ""for what they are"" as Marcus Aurelius put it. It's not necessarily that Stoicism cured me, it just gave me the tools to confront something I believed was bigger than myself for a long time.

Choose not to be harmed—and you won’t feel harmed. Don’t feel harmed—and you haven’t been.,"I like this quote. I come back to it often. I wanted to know if I am applying it correctly after certain situations. 

For example. Every so often I will get into a negative confrontation which leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I tend to obsessive about things in gerneral. Be overly sensitive. Deem everything as a slight at times. I don't want to drone on but someone posted a post something like stoicism is not therapy or substitute for it. And it's not. Not for someone with add who hates to read it definitely won't be. But certain quotes like the one above really can make an impact. Now!! The point. 

Basically I went to a store I do deliveries for they know me. I asked the employee for an additional plastic bag to keep something warm. And he would just not want to do it. Said we can't? I challenged him. He didn't relent. I said I will pay for a freaking 2 cent bag. Still would not do it. Very infuriating, frustrating. Annoying.

But, long story short, I said some things recently that they did not like and they decided to kick me out of the group (one of them even stuck their neck out for me before).

2. Seeing something triggering memory of wife (Breakup Recently - Don't wanna cry)
3. Speaking about Wife (As above)
4. Not enough table's to set up required event (Work)
5. That during my Mental Health assessment the assessor would think I'm mental and report me
6. The Bus Home from work leaves early (As usual)

My list of What is in my Complete Control preceding my aversions

1. Getting up early enough
2. My own choice to ruminate
3. Not to stalk her social media
4. Speaking honestly about my mental health to the assessor
5. Left it blank here I did 
6. Checking the bus times and live tracking

The issues I had trying to apply stoic principles,"This year I started my stoic journey and I've been enjoying it so far. I feel better overall, but the thing I like the most about stoicism is that I have guidance or some sort of ""framework"" on how to behave on any given situation, which facilitates making tough decisions.

One issue I struggled with for some time is knowing what would be ""the stoic way"" to handle certain scenarios I faced in my life. And this was an issue for two reasons:

1. I would have to search for a specific teaching/quote/insight on stoic books that would relate to the situation I'm going through. This is not easy since most stoic books (at least the most popular ones) aren't structured in an organized way. They're mostly just a bunch of teachings with no particular order or association to a specific subject.
2. Once I found some quote or teaching, it was hard to clearly understand the underlying message. I'm kind of new to philosophy, so most times the language used was difficult for me to understand.

So I ended up building an app that would help me with that. I'm not intending to do self-promotion so I wont share any particular details, but I imagine if its helping me now, it can potentially help others.

So I would like to know what people practicing Stoicism think about the concept and what I could do to make it useful to others, so I can share it through the appropriate channels.

It works as follow:

1. You enter some situation you're going through your life. Could be anything, from minor things that happen on your day-to-day to more meaningful situations that affect your overall wellbeing.
2. The app scan through a set of stoic books looking for quotes or teachings that relate to your scenario.
3. Using AI, the app display's the following:
   1. The quote extracted from the books, exactly as it was taken from the source.
   2. The quote explained in plain english. No complex or ancient language, the quote is explained as a friend would explain it to you.
   3. An explanation of how a stoic would handle the situation you're going through. Everything based on the quote mentioned in point no. 1.

# Example

**My scenario:**

*I'm working on expanding my social circle and building meaningful friendships. It's not easy for me to connect with new people and maintain those relationships since I'm very shy*

**The quote taken from books:**

*Judge no speech or action unworthy of you which is consistent with nature. Be not dissuaded by any consequent criticism or censure from others; but, if the speech or action be honourable, judge yourself worthy to say or do it. Those who criticize you have their own conscience and their own motives. These you are not to regard, but follow a straight course, guided by your own nature and the nature of the Universe, both of which point the same way.*

**The quote explained:**

Do not let the opinions or criticisms of others discourage you from pursuing actions that are in line with your own nature and the nature of the Universe. If your intentions are honorable, consider yourself worthy of engaging in those actions or expressing those thoughts. The judgments and motives of others should not influence your decisions, as they have their own perspectives and motivations. Instead, stay true to yourself and follow the path that aligns with your nature and the greater order of the Universe.

**The quote in the context of my scenario:**

In your scenario of expanding your social circle and building meaningful friendships, it is important to remember that you should not let the shyness or potential criticism from others deter you from connecting with new people. The quote emphasizes that you should not judge your own actions or words as unworthy simply because they may be met with criticism or disapproval. Instead, if your intentions are genuine and honorable, you should consider yourself worthy of making the effort to connect with others and build meaningful relationships. The opinions and judgments of others should not hinder your pursuit of social connections, as they have their own perspectives and motivations. Stay true to your own nature and the natural inclination for human connection, and do not let external factors discourage you from taking action.

Stoicism is not a replacement for therapy.,"As the title says.

Stoicism is not a replacement for medical intervention. It can replace mental healthy therapy as much as it can replace physical therapy.

It can be an brilliant *companion* to medical intervention as you navigate recovery from any given problem, but it is not a replacement.

Remember, a stoic seeks to understand the world around us. To prioritise knowledge and wisdom above all else. 

There is a wealth of quality, validated research on mental health treatments.

The moment we reject the best established science in favour of *our own interpretation of a philosophy* is the moment we stop being rational, and start treating stoicism as a faith.

This is not just for the very large amount of people coming here seeking stoicism as a replacement for therapy, but directed at the far too many people encouraging using stoicism as a replacement for therapy.

The stoics once believed gravity was that objects are compelled to return to their natural resting point as an innate property of the object itself - A rock belongs on the floor so it is compelled to return there!

Trying to identify a specific translation of Meditations by Marcus Aurelius,"I saw a photo of just one page from book 6, and I’d like to read this translation with my niece. I’m having trouble identifying which translation it is. Any help is much appreciated! The page is as follows:

50. Do your best to convince them. But act on your own, if justice mures i. If met with force, then ice back on acceprance and percability. Use the setback to practice other virtues.
Remember that our efforts are subject to circumstances; you reren't aiming to do the impossible.
-Aiming to do what, then?
To try. And you succeeded. What you set out to do is accom-plished.

51. Ambition means tying your well-being to what other people say or do.
Self-indulgence means tying it to the things that happen to you.
Sanity means tying it to your own actions.

52. You don't have to turn this into something. It doesn't have to upset you. Things can't shape our decisions by themselves.

53. Practice really hearing what people say. Do your best to get inside their minds.

54. What injures the hive injures the bee.

55. If the crew talked back to the captain, or patients to their doc-for, then whose authority would they accept? How could the passengers be kept safe or the patient healthy?

56. All those people who came into the world with me and have already left it.

"Genuinely curious, why should I live if no one can love me","I don’t have a single friend. They all abandoned me for various reasons or they betrayed me. I always was treated like an option or just a background character. Never treated like a *friend*. I’ve never had a boyfriend or a girlfriend before because I am physically unattractive. I’m 24 and female. My relationship with my immediate family has been diminishing since I’ve been completely alone for years. 

I’ve never felt proper love. I’ve been alone, ignored, treated like shit by nearly everyone around me, stranger or not. I can’t make friends, but either way, I don’t really want to because I can’t trust or tolerate anyone anymore after being alone for so long. No one understands that my life is over, there is no hope or “right people” for me. It’s either gas myself (I already have a suicide plan) or live the rest of my life alone, depressed and struggling. No one wants to be around me, no matter what I do no one wants to be my friend and no one wants to be with me because I’m ugly. And no, this is not going to change. Despite what people say, no it doesn’t get better or change. It doesn’t matter what I’ve done, I’ve never won socially. 

I’ve met so many people and befriended them. Only for a temporary time. And I’m still completely alone. My personality is bitter and angry, nothing can change that. My life is truly over and no. Like I said. It’s not going to change. I’ve been like this since I left high school. 

Why should I live? I don’t know anyone else, online or irl in the same situation. Sure, they may not have ever had a parter, but they have friends. Or vice versa. But no one has neither except me. I’m clearly a defect of a human, incapable of being loved or even tolerated by the same species. Im tired of the same BS advice, that it will change and get better.

It’s all coming to an end…,"I’m a 20 year old, soon to be 21 (maybe)male  and I feel that my life has come to an end. 

For as long as I can remember, I’ve always known I would die young. Whether that be by nature, an accident or my own hands, I knew it was going to happen. I wasn’t a very lucky child. I had my first “sexual” experience at 5, with my two other male cousins. It was the turning point in my life. From then on it has been nothing but a downhill slope from there. I like to be around children and keep them happy and to make sure that nothing harms them. That they can stay their innocent and happy selves, wish someone would’ve had done that with me. Turns out from the three of us, I was the only one to develop feelings for guys even though it was never my idea nor did I like it. I’ve always felt dirty ever since then. From then on I consumed every food that caught my eyes because for some reason, that was what kept me from thinking about how “guilty” I felt.  I got older, fatter, yet always knew how to entertain a crowd. From 7-18 it was nothing but yo-yo diets, feeling insecure like any other teenager and simple unrequited crushes. I just kind of gave up then. Did I mention I am in the closet of an extremely homophobic, highly Christian-conservative household? Well I am. And even when I try to be careful I always make mistakes, that costs my family a lot (sometimes a lot of money too) I’m really sorry for that. I have a dream. Not that big of a dream but I had one. That one day, in my mid twenties I would move away to a foreign country, with a language I can not speak, preferably japan, and move to a quiet small beach town and just work at a cafe, free from anything, everyone. Somewhere where I can start all over again. Be clean. But that dream got crushed the moment I realized that I can move away from my situation,but I can never move away from my mind. This wasn’t a cry for help. Nothing can help me anymore. I love my family more than anything but I wish I could get murdered just so that they won’t face the pain of not truly knowing what storm laid inside my heart which made me wanted to kill myself. Maybe this story lands somewhere with someone who’s struggling with the same things maybe my story that didn’t have such a happy ending could mean the world to someone’s who could.

Core precepts/values and virtues - clarification please,"Bear with me here as I may be using the terms incorrectly.

Epictetus advised us to have core precepts to guide us in our daily lives.

Let's say we choose things such as: Being mindful and intentional. Staying in our power (not letting others sway us); being disciplined etc

Is the assumption correct that the virtues Temperance, Wisdom, Courage, Justice aren't core values as such but are what underpin our core values? Therefore the virtues are the foundations that help us with our core values?

I'm asking for clarification as I'd like to document this at the start of a journal specific to keeping me on track with these teachings.

Suppressing emotions,"Hey there,
Am 17 and I am relatively new to stoicism I had lot of trouble while traveling the journey of life,
The problem is that I feel like,I am emotionally weak at times I can't control my anger.whenever I feel angry.I try to control myself but there are times when I have meltdowns whenever I supress my angry for way too long(happens rarely tho).there was this kid from  my class whose bigger than me usually makes fun of me(dudes a bully) most of the time around my classmates,one day we got into an argument and I never were good at arguments,
So I started throwing hands with him and I somehow managed to knock the dude out with a single scratch but even tho I felt sense of happiness after that,later on post realisation hit me like a truck after realising the collatral damage I have created(I accidentally hurt my friends who were trying to seperate us).even tho he was the one who started all of this mess,i apologised to everyone present there.whenever I let my anger control myself I have no memories of the event also I could have accidentally severly injured the guy if I choked him any longer

So I don't want anger to control myself there were many instances similar to this.i always try my best not to cause any trouble and I try my best to avoid being angry at people.but unfortunately I get into fights way often considering how emotionally unstable I am and my mom asked what would happen if I accidentally kill someone if I let my anger control me(as there were similar events just like this)and the question still revolves in my head.

How can one be virtuous if they have a bad moral compass,"Hi all, 

I have been practicing Stoicism for a couple years now but have a question regarding the philosophy which I can’t figure out (probably due to my inexperience/knowledge) The philosophy is more broadly a practical one rather than theoretical one, and encourages people to learn through experience rather than pure study, ‘waste no time arguing what a good man should be. Be one’ 

How does this work if you have an objectively bad moral compass but don’t realise it, I.e. think you are doing the right thing, but are actually causing more harm to people than good, but in your eyes you are practicing stoicism. 

Doesn’t this idea mean we should actually debate what is right and wrong to broaden our understanding of virtue?",Stoicism,1701682535.0,t3_18agpnx,0.77,7
Stoicism Vs. Unconditional Forgiveness,"There’s a man named Cliffe Knechtle, a pastor. I came across a video of his which speaks on “forgiveness” and if it has limits. I wanted to make an attempt to respond to how I *think* a practicing stoic would. I would love the insight of others, and the assistance with realigning wherever I may fall short. 

Interviewer: “When does God say “No more, I can’t forgive you for this.”?

Cliff: “I used to work in a prison at Lawrence Massachusetts. Every monday night I would go there, and I first would go into the cell of a man in protective custody who kidnapped little boys, sexually abused him, and murdered him. And after being with him I would go into the basketball gym to play basketball with the other inmates and they would come up to me and say, “Cliffe how can you even talk to such a piece of dirt, don’t you know what he did?” And I say, “Yes I do know what he did, pretty horrendous, pretty grotesque, pretty evil, but he still is a human being created in the image of God, and god offers him forgiveness as horrible as that is. Now there’s a part of me that doesn’t like that, cause I’ve never kidnapped little boys, sexually molested him and murdered him, so I think I’m better. No unfortunately I’m not better, Because in my own sophisticated erudite way I have rebelled against God. I am in desperate need of God’s Grace, his forgiveness, and for me to look down on a guy like that and and say, “Oh, you’re just so inferior, you’re just a piece of dirt” No, he’s a human being created in the image of God, that image has been horribly defaced, horribly, but he still is a human being created in the image of God and God offers him forgiveness.”

- The man in question kidnapped, molested and murdered little boys. This in itself is considered an indifference/external. So, it’s how we use what has happened that is ‘good’ or ‘bad’. ‘Good’ would be to lock this person up or prevent them from doing what they’ve done again in any way possible. ‘Bad’ would be to *not* prevent this person from doing what they’ve done again, in whatever way possible. 

- If we were in a position to choose whether to speak to the criminal, or to…*not* speak to them, the choice is dependent on whether or not doing so would be an act of virtue, with virtue being assigned to what is dependent on our will. If this is the case, then the decision on whether we speak to him or not makes no difference, but how we act within each choice *does* make the difference. If we decided to speak to him, what would be the virtuous way to do so? 

“*You say, “Philosophers talk paradoxes” But are there no paradoxes in the other arts? and what is more paradoxical than to puncture a man’s eye in order that he may see? If anyone said this to a man ignorant of the surgical art, would he not ridicule the speaker? Where is the wonder then if in philosophy also many things which are true appear paradoxical to the inexperienced?*” Epictetus, Discourse 1.25 “On the Same”. 

Based on this quote, I’ve concluded that if I listened to my impression then yes, I would choose not to speak to him because doing so would be bad. However, if my purpose in speaking with the criminal was to learn about why he did it and to prevent it from occurring again, then it would be the right way to act. If I chose to speak to him only to remind him of how shitty of a person is and throw insults at him, this would be *bad* because I am harming my own character by doing this. —— The inexperienced in this case would be the prisoners that question why Cliff even speaks to the man. (?)

-  “*Now there’s a part of me that doesn’t like that, cause I’ve never kidnapped little boys, sexually molested him and murdered him, so I think i’m better. No unfortunately I’m not better, because in my own sophisticated erudite way I have rebelled against God*”. It seems that within Christianity, Rebelling against God = acting without virtue. At least, if our decision to think “I’m better than this guy” leads us to act without virtue, then it is bad. So, am I better than this child, Lester? The truth is: It doesn’t matter. 

- Finally, forgiveness. Would I/Should I forgive? Well, it’s not even my place to forgive. This would be desiring what belongs to others which is a no no. If it WERE my place to forgive (ex. I’m the child that was murdered), whether I forgive or not is…no?

How to overcome severe emotional and physical suffering alongside chronic pain,"I (19M) have been through multiple rough patches in my life. To summarize, I struggled with bullying and loneliness as a child. My home country is going through a civil war, and my father has lost all his life savings and our family's wealth and committed suicide after I tried to stop him (but clearly didn't do enough). So, at the mere age of 16, my family fell apart, and we became semi-broke. Add that to the grief of my losing my father and the trauma from the event. This was during COVID-19, so the physical isolation did not really help.

But, throughout all of this, I still managed to succeed in school and gained admission to a top university in the US with a full scholarship. Being the oldest son, I was always the one expected to perform, and I always had a goal of giving back to my mother. During my time at university, I also managed to get a great GPA and pursued multiple internships throughout my summers and during the semesters. I had a carefully crafted plan to reach my goals, and I was determined to succeed despite everything.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Fast forward to the beginning of my most important semester yet, the one where I have to apply for my junior internships and the one where I have to take the hardest yet most important courseload. I started developing pain in my testicles; being the diligent person I am, I saw a specialist the next day of that happening. I got prescribed antibiotics, yet after completing a course of 3 weeks, the pain never went away. But I was determined not to let this pain stop me from pursuing my goals. A month later, after being in constant pain and going to 3 different doctors, I started having pain in my right testicle; this pain was excruciating. I immediately went to the ER, where they conducted imaging and lab tests and concluded nothing was wrong, so I was sent on my way. But the pain never really subsided. After countless ER and specialist visits, I was found to have a blood clot in my right-sided scrotum, which is apparently so rare only 25 cases have been previously documented. I took my meds, but the constant pain never really went away. It seems the condition is ""resolved,"" i.e., they can't find the clots anymore. But here I am left with a constant pain that often turns excruciating over the course of 4 months with no doctor seeming to help and hope of relief in the future.

&#x200B;

I couldn't apply for internships, and my academics suffered greatly to the point where I started failing classes; I am now experiencing severe depression and chronic pain. My body is always tired and fatigued. I can't help but think of my friends and colleagues who are all leading everyday nice lives, and some of whom are succeeding in the way I dreamt and worked so hard to achieve.

I now live alone and practically isolated, away from family, severely depressed, bedridden, and in chronic pain. My life fell apart, and I have lost my dreams and goals.

How would a stoic approach this predicament? How can I train my mindset to continue pushing through these problems?

Been experiencing anger issues lately.,"I moved here in Romania recently and today has marked 2 months since my arrival, I started a ""new life"" as some may say, with a better job and out of the ghetto, I came here to take care of my grandma because she raised me and I want to honor my grandfather who died this year, a true orthodox family man. 

But I made a lot of sacrifices to come here, I was used to having dozens of friends, now I have like two, my girlfriend of one year and a half broke up with me because I decided to go and take care of my family and a long distance was ""too much"" for her despite me being willing to make a 1100km trip just to see her every month. 

And apparently this, plus the job I work which is indeed pretty easy but is a hard to master skill, have made me notice I've been becoming way angrier than I was. 

I have my father's explosive anger and my mother's vengefulness, which may indeed be assets at times but the explosive part is making me want to punch the shit out of anything that doesn't work within 2 seconds. 

I already go to the gym..i think i will start boxing since im interested in it and punching is literally my immediate reflex to anything nowadays for some reason. 

But I'd want also a more in depth opinion of the Stoics of how I could handle this.

Struggling with sexual desire and buying sex,"Although sex is a normal thing, as a single virgin 28M am struggling with it. Ideal solution would be to have a stable relationship with someone, and i can do it if i pursue. But i come from a conservative background where my parents won't accept it. I have been seeing a few woman online chat/call upon their recommendation, but i live in abroad (in a more liberal society), so the communication gap with the other people matters a lot. I have been away from my family over 5 years. I do need physical affection and love and hug in this single life (friends are not enough). I don't see myself getting married soon, and i have been seriously considering buying instead of wasting my 20s youth time just like that. Can’t deny that this sex drive may have affected my work.

Accept or Adverse,"Too often do I hear and read from so called professionals, gurus, mentors, authors, priests, etc 
That Stoicism is too passive of a practice and relies to heavy on determinism and apathy therefore having no effect on the conscience mind that is constantly trying to progress. For reference, Iv read E, S, and MA more times than I can count and continue to read them daily alongside my Bible. This is my path as a Prokopton.  What really grinds my gears is for the high level articles and pundits to give the observation that we are to accept all that happens to us. Blasphemy! I see it here in this Reddit group more than I can count and I hope this post will serve as my response in future discourses. 


“The true man is revealed in difficult times. So when trouble comes, think of yourself as a wrestler whom God, like a trainer, has paired with a tough young buck. For what purpose? To turn you into Olympic-class material.” Epictetus

“What would have become of Hercules, do you think, if there had been no lion, hydra, stag or boar – and no savage criminals to rid the world of? What would he have done in the absence of such challenges? Obviously he would have just rolled over in bed and gone back to sleep. So by snoring his life away in luxury and comfort he never would have developed into the mighty Hercules.” Epictetus

What I’m saying is, giving the response of “it’s not in my control” isn’t an all encompassing response to difficulty. The message that so many miss. Mainly the dichotomy of control isn’t just about recognizing what is external or internal so you can disregard uncontrollable events, it’s about recognizing what you can/need to take action on.

No freedom in life.," 

I dont want to bore y'all with details, so in short, I am 19F. My mother doesn't give me much freedom to go outside home alone unless its college/work. This lack of autonomy has resulted in a pretty boring life, and zero life outside academics. It gets quite mundane, but my thoughts entertain me. However, a time frequently comes where I have reject my friends' invitations to outings/meetups/malls/college programs, etc and that's when I realize that I have no liberty in my life, causing emotional pain and pity like no other. Its been years now, I believe I should be used to it.

There's isn't much I can do about it either, I have tried reasoning things out multiple time and it doesn't end well. I can only move out at 24-25 (Our culture doesn't allow moving out either but I have a plan figured out). Logically it is easy to convince myself that I can't do much about it but it doesn't ease the emotional pain, specially when I have relive this while explaining to situations to friends, or think of the memories I could have made.

The only thing I end up doing is distracting myself from pain by social media or video games. I see no other way out.

"Logos, the mind, and change","**TLDR**:

If you're dissatisfied with your circumstances and you want to change your dissatisfaction, you have to change either your reasoning process to change your judgements about your circumstances, the circumstances themselves, or a combination of both. The rest of the title is only ~~for the nerds~~ a click-bait.

**Full post**:

I’ve noticed a common pattern in advice posts where the posters ask how to be content about a situation in life they’re obviously dissatisfied with, yet they insist on changing neither their desire nor their situation. Typically they mention doing Stoic “practices” such as “acceptance of fate”, “negative visualisation”, “dichotomy of control”, etc.

In this post I will try to explain why none of these “practices” by themselves have any causal effects on contentment by relating to the concept of Logos and the Stoic theory of the mind.

***Logos***

Logos is defined as “the rational principle governing the universe” ([source](https://iep.utm.edu/stoicism/#SH2b)). The word “rational” here means explainable, consistent, causal, and deterministic. In other words the opposite of true random chance. Note that the ancients didn’t come up with the abstract concept “rational” and looked for things existing in the universe that they could apply this concept on. It’s the other way around – they observed that things existing in the universe follow a causal pattern and they described the phenomenon as “rational”.

This “rational” characteristic of the universe is what allows us to thrive using our “rational” mind. We are the only animal species that’s capable of comprehending this “rationality” permeating throughout the universe and using it to our advantage.

It might be difficult to wrap your head around this concept because it’s the only observable universe    we have access to. To understand what an “irrational” universe would be like, consider these thought experiments:

* What if gravity switches between pulling and pushing completely randomly?
* What if fire switches between generating and absorbing heat completely randomly?
* What if the Earth changes its shape between sphere, cubicle, pyramid, flat, cylinder, etc completely randomly?

When you consider these possibilities you will see how impossible it is for us humans the way we are now to live in such a universe.

Personally I prefer to understand Logos as a combination of mathematical rules (as opposed to linguistic rules) and natural laws (as opposed to man-made laws).

***The*** ***mind***

The ancient Stoics believed that the mind was purely physical ([source](https://iep.utm.edu/stoicmind/#SH2a)). Scholars haven't reached an agreement on whether this means strictly what we now call “[materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism)” or something else entirely. Regardless of what this belief should be called, they agree the Stoics believed the mind is a thing that is made up of physical materials and thus follows the physical laws of the universe.

What this means is the mind isn’t only capable of comprehending the “rationality” of the universe, it operates based on the same “rational” principle itself. The short version of the Stoic theory of mind in relation to this principle is as follow:

* We perceive external stimuli in the form of perceptions.
* We combine these perceptions with our existing beliefs (which by themselves are formed through the same “rational” principle) to form judgements (or also called impressions).
* Our emotions are a result of these judgements. Some think emotions are how the mind perceive the judgements (or how the judgements “feel”), some think they are caused by the judgements, some others think they are side-effects (or by-products) of judgements. In any case there is an inseparable link between our judgements and emotions.

There is much more to the Stoic theory of the mind but for the purpose of this post this short description will suffice. The important lesson we want to take from this is that our judgements and emotions are caused by the application of our reasoning process when combining our perceptions of reality with our existing beliefs.

***Change***

With the knowledge of how the mind works in Stoicism, the question that follows is how do we change our emotions? Given that emotions are caused by 2 factors (or variables): our beliefs and the facts about reality (our circumstances), it logically follows that our emotions will change if and only if there are changes in those factors.

As a software engineer, when I learned about the Stoic theory of mind I immediately related it to how I have always approached my software. The software is programmed in a certain way (my beliefs), this programming reflects my understanding of the business requirements, the programming operates on fundamental mathematics and logic (Logos). Given a set of input (circumstances) the software always produces the same set of output (emotions). If the output doesn’t match my expectation (a bug in software engineering terms), then I will proceed to think about whether I should change my input or my programming, or both (sometimes I also change business requirements, but that also falls under changing my ""beliefs"").

If you can’t relate to my software analogy, try to think of it like a mathematical function f(x) = y, where:

* f denotes a transformation function which contains formulas (beliefs), which adhere to mathematical laws (logos) such as commutative, associative, distributive, and so on.
* x is a variable (circumstances).
* y is the result of transforming x with the function f (emotions).

This means if you want a different result, let’s call y’, you have to change either the input to x’, or the function to f’, or again both.

If it’s still hard to relate, let’s try another analogy. Suppose you want to get inside a room behind a closed door. You turn the knob clockwise. You pull it inwards and it doesn’t open. At this point you can try one of the followings if you still want to get inside the room:

* Turn the knob anti-clockwise.
* Push the door outwards.
* Assert if it’s possible that the door is locked from the inside, if so:
   * Is there a keyhole, and if so where is the key?
   * Is there an alternative way to get inside the room without going through that door (is there a side entrance, a window with which you can climb into the room, and so on)?
* ~~Kick it open.~~

In summary, the point I’m trying to make with this post is that if you feel a certain way about something and you want to change how you feel, then you have to change something that directly contributes to how you feel about it, be it your beliefs or the thing itself. If you change neither and insist on seeing a change in how you feel, you will certainly fail because you will be trying to fight against the laws of the universe. It will be like repeatedly hitting the switch of a broken light bulb hoping that eventually it will light up.",Stoicism,1701595664.0,t3_189q0lt,0.89,26
How to reconcile this?,"Stoicism says you can only control your internals like your own thoughts, actions & reactions.

But are we truly in control of our thoughts & actions? Our actions at any given moment are influenced by so many factors like our general upbringing, our traumas, desires, aversions, our surrounding environment, our biological disposition  & many more and most of these factors are beyond our control. 

Same goes for our thoughts.

Then how am I really in control of my thoughts and actions?

Even me stumbling upon ideas of stoicism wasn't in my control. One day Youtube decided to recommend me a video of stoicism and that point I was in a mood to watch a self help video.

So at best Stoicism can be an emotion management tool which requires many perceptual adjustments to really internalize it in one's life.

Embarking on 'Our Journey of Self-Improvement and Collaboration,"I find myself at a juncture in life where cultivating virtues has become imperative. I've taken strides in developing habits, yet maintaining consistency and identifying my shortcomings prove challenging. In light of this, I am eager to propose the formation of a mastermind group focused on self-improvement and Stoicism. Through mutual support, we can collectively address our growth areas. This collaborative effort, along with staying committed to our goals as a team, promises not only personal benefits for each of us but also the nurturing of collaboration skills and character traits. Let's work together on our self-development to make a positive impact on ourselves and the world.

  
 As Marcus Aurelius once wrote in his journal, now known as 'Meditations': 

> “If someone is able to show me that what I think or do is not right, I will happily change, for I seek the truth, by which no one was ever truly harmed.”

I'm afraid of losing my income. How do I redirect my thoughts?,"I know that it's outside of my control, regardless of how hard I work and perform, I could still lose my income.

My problem is that I feel that this fear is preventing me from applying to other companies because I start imagining scenarios where I wouldn't fit in and get fired from that new company.

I'm considering applying to other companies because
(1) the commute could be better
(2) I could probably earn more
(3) I feel like I will never be promoted at this company, as my application was rejected twice already in the past two years.

So, then I start rationalizing how my one hour commute is not that bad, how my salary is relatively decent and that I don't want to take on more responsibilities and lose little work-life balance I have.

Should I not fix it, if it ain't broke? Is there an alternative approach? Or is it simply about having more courage and embrace the possibility that the new job would suck and/or I could lose my income?",Stoicism,1701572268.0,t3_189jwiv,0.77,7

Is stoicism working for you?,"Don't know when you guys realized that stoicism is really helping you, but for me it clicked when I realized a few years ago that I was no longer overly afraid to die. 

&#x200B;

I used to struggle with the idea that I was sick with something, any tiny symptom that I had I would think I had some sort of bad cancer. Practicing negative visualization in the beginning helped me big time with that, only 10 minutes every morning, but making it a routine. It helped me understand that during the day when any negative thought came I didn't need to think about, I could simply talk myself into waiting for tomorrow's session. I realized I was becoming a much less anxious person, to the point now that I have to, for example, to do the opposite and force myself to go to the doctor to have some regular checkups, otherwise I won't even bother.

&#x200B;

It's still not perfect though, I still struggle at work, for example, to keep it cool when I'm confronted with something, when my boss does something I don't like... I still let this kind of stuff get to me. Even though it is a little better, I still see this as a big area of improvement. I can't for example receive an email that triggers some reaction on me, put it on my to do list, and carry on with the next task. I keep thinking about it until I reply it, and sometimes my answer is not the greatest as I'm still emotional when I reply to it.

&#x200B;

Obviously I know I will never be a sage, there are some areas where you excel, others that you find more difficult, but after 5 years practicing stoicism, I can say that it really helps me big time, and it completely changed my life for the best. It gave me tools to deal with frustrations and difficulties, and I'm grateful even for the simple fact that it made me think about how I behave, ways I could improve myself to make my life and my loved ones better.

"""In the void is Virtue, and no evil""_Miyamoto Musashi","I've long felt that there were alot of similarities between Miyamoto Musashi's Infinite Success and Marcus Aurelius' Meditations. Maybe it's because of ""take up the attitude of the sun"" and ""to watch the courses of the stars as if you revolved with them"". Lines that standout for me in both books and to me appear to be talking about the exact same thing in the exact same way. Musashi while talking about the void in that book says ""..it is where there is nothing...it is not contained in man's knowledge."" I guess i feel like the body of knowledge of Stoicism is incomplete (I wouldn't know, I haven't read every Stoic text ever written)because of the absence of sages among us everyday. But someone wrote a comment on  here sometime that made me think Stoic Sages are all around us, but we would never know they are here because they are doing their job well.(Like the Oracle when she tells Neo, that there are programs running all over the place, programs to control the sun, the wind, and that the one's doing what they were meant to do, we would never know they are were here). To get to the void Musashi writes that ""..polish the two fold spirit heart and mind"", for which Stoicism as I've come to know it is the best substance for that. And to ""..sharpen the twofold gaze perception and sight"", which to me means understanding the origin of my mother tongue(Luganda). Origin as in which visual element in nature is associated with which sound in my mother tongue, and why.",Stoicism,1701539637.0,t3_18993g0,0.89,15
Detachment vs effort,"I'm making my way though Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus and reading a lot about the detachment from things we can't control. To me it sounds really similar to themes in Christianity and Buddhism and I really appreciate it and think this is a great way to live through adversity.

My quandary and the issue I have in applying it to my life has to do with the disconnect between detachment and creative effort. Despite being content with anything, stoics, I assume, still strive for things other than contentment? There is an imperative to ""live in accordance with nature/reason/God."" There is (even though the texts don't talk about it frequently) positive things we ought to do? Say I'm a husband and father (I am). Isn't it in keeping with stoicism that I provide for my family? Let's say I'm struggling to do that. I think the common stoic advice is to focus on the effort that I apply in this regard and accept that ultimately success is outside of my control. The idea is that I control my actions and not my situation.

The problem with that is it's only true in philosophy world. You absolutely DO have control over your success even if that control is partial and success can't be guaranteed. We are intelligent creatures and opportunities for creative solutions to our problems abound. The world is full of stories of people who thought their way out of difficult situations. Ok, but the stoics do say you can make the attempt so what's the issue? 

The issue is that trying to try isn't trying. One can only fully engage in difficult creative problem solving if they believe that the solution is within their control and they are attached to the outcome. No Olympic winner was just trying to try his best. They were trying to win. The investment in the outcome is necessary for the effort. I know from personal experience how much less likely I am to solve a technical problem I encounter if I think it might not have a solution. This is the opposite of the stoic advice which emphasizes acceptance of fate.

Does Stoicism Accept Suicide?,"Julius Caesar ended him. George Washington wanted to be like him.

Cato The Younger, the most Stoic of the Stoics, decided to die instead of living under a dictator.

But was his death against Stoicism's main idea?

Cato, when he realized Julius Caesar was going to win the war and become the sole ruler of Rome, went to his room.

There, with the noises of fighting men and death clouding his ears, he sat down to read some Plato.

Soon after, the time had come.

Cato took his sword and stabbed himself in the stomach deep enough to feel it, but not deep enough to kill him.

When his son and some of his soldiers entered the room, they found Cato hurt and bloody but not dead.

So they did what any good son and ally would do: they tried to save him.

But then, Cato did the unthinkable.

He was so committed to his cause, or so blinded and confused (I'll get to that in a second), that he disemboweled himself.

In plain English, Cato used his hands to take out his own guts and ensure certain death.

Not only is this a horrific way to die, but it also raises big questions.

Sure, I'm with Cato: this needs balls. To stand against a dictator and show your opposition with works, not words.

But why doesn't anyone comment on the fact that Cato went against Stoicism's most important idea: The Dichotomy of Control?

The fact that Julius Caesar was going (he didn't) to become Rome's ruler was out of Cato's or anyone's control.

Shouldn't Cato, as a Stoic, have accepted this course of events and done the best with what was given to him?

Of course, this brings new questions:

1. What if Caesar killed him? From historical references, Cato and Caesar did no hate each other. But I get that Cato would prefer to die out of his own hands.
2. The Stoics, and Cato as well, viewed life and death as indifferent. So they were fine with one ending one's life, only if the situation demanded it (sacrifice for the common good) or if their life was unbearable.

Advice On Moving Out and Possibly Coming Out to Religious Family,"Hi there, I'm a 21 Y.O. male from the UK, and would like some advice when it comes to moving out from my family home and living independently.

I'm in a bit of a tough situation, as my parents and family are aware of my apathetic attitude towards Islam. They know that they'll have to continually force me to wake up for morning prayer, they know that most of my friends are non-Muslim and they know that me moving out could only mean that I'm looking to distance myself from them and the religion.

I know many others who've managed to gain independence once they've moved out for university, but since I've been working from home ever since I left high-school at 18, I've never been able to use the excuse that I'm looking to move out for work related reasons. They'll only accept me moving out once I've found a wife.

This is why I feel forced to come out to them and tell them that I'm no longer a Muslim, for the sake of my own sanity. I'm not sure what the best approach is when it comes to telling them I'm moving out, or that I'm no longer a practicing Muslim. I've accepted that my family would most likely disown me, but I find it hard not to feel responsible for the pain that I'm causing them.

Im not clear on how to articulate my thoughts on this subject: I check this sub from time to time and what i find are in a lot of cases are questions that should be a simple answer: seek professional help. 

Correct me if im wrong but stoicism is a way to think about the world and your place in it. What it is not is a  sound system for dealing with the complex emotions of depression, thoughts of suicide or any other extreme mental health issues. 

My belief has always been that the people who struggle with stoic behaviors and or beliefs are not fit for stoicism. Again correct me if im wrong. 

Im rambling a bit but this was on my mind so i figured id share and open up for discussion. 

My follow up questions would be: 

Why do we stoics struggle with seeking professional help?

I suck,"I'm a piece of fucking shit . I don't like myself right now as I'm typing this. I have a little brother who I'd kill for and die for, he's a little difficult to deal with but I love him none the less. I'm supposed to protect him from the dangers of this world but I can't even protect him from my fucking self. I don't mean to hurt him in any way possible but it seems like I keep unintentionally damaging him. I don't know what to do. Just an hour ago i was attempting to get him off my bed so that he can go to his as it's night time and I didn't want him to get scolded(he has a tendency to take forever to get on the bed) and I thought he got his footing when I lifted him up but he didn't. He fell backwards in a kneeling type position and then he fell back and hit his head hard. The sound was fucking horrifying. As he hit his head he cried Mama! Mama! Man that was fucking hard to listen to man 😢. Then he started crying and I held him up. He held his head as he was crying and I don't know what to fucking do man, i feel so fucking guilty. He's okay now and is on his bed but there's this huge bump that hurts on his head and I just can't keep myself together when i think about it. Not the first time he's hit his head because of me and i didn't mean to. I never mean to and yet he still gets fucking hurt. I've never had thoughts about ending my life and I never will but i just think i might. Thank God 🙏 he was seen to by my mom and is okay now but I don't know, i don't know what to do.


Hey guys I appreciate the comments. The reason why I needed to get it out was because it's not the first time I accidentally hurt him when I had no intention to. It sucks knowing that i could possibly hurt him when trying to help him and when i do remember i try to be mindful but I'm a fairly forgetful person so it doesn't always register. I'm not a weak guy mentally in any way whatsoever but damn does it hurt when I know i could be responsible for something terrible to happen to my brother.

My question is that what difference does it make if nature is rational and providential? How does that add to the argument that nature commands us to live in obedience to reason and designed us to gravitate towards virtue? This question stems from the fact that even if our nature is to be rational, the question still remains: why should we live in accordance with nature? What makes it to live in accordance with nature the morally right thing to do?",Stoicism,1701387834.0,t3_187wyal,0.86,10
Is the heroic masculine purpose equivalent to the pursuit of Stoic moral virtue?,"I just watched this video below and I cannot not see that there is a connection between the heroic masculine purpose themed in this deconstruction and the desire to live by Stoic virtues. Is there a connection? Are they the same thing? Is the heroic masculine purpose a real thing, and if so is there a place for it in Stoicism?

Part of the draw of Stoicism for me is, the desire to live a virtuous life. It oozes purpose. And to see that it permeates the idea of the masculine hero  in our popular culture shows that stoicism is mainstream yet undefined as such or masquerading as a hero's journey.

the thoughts are winning this week and I feel like I wanna disappear just to see how others will react,"I've struggled with depression and loneliness for years, it comes and goes in waves.

This past week its all coming back full force. The morning car ride to work is filled with these ""what ifs,"" the car ride home is the same, and I spend half my night just fantasizing about how others will react, if they even care, or even what I would write on a note and who I would mention kinda thing. Who I would thank, who I would ignore...

I dont really plan on doing it, but I cant help but fantasize about it.

The very worst part is that I have a bunch of people that seem to truly really care about me. I dont feel it much from my parents or brother, they're a very ""buh tough love"" type bullshit, but I feel it from my friends and even coworkers. Kinda sad that I feel closer and more accepted and cared for from my coworkers than my own family but it is what it is.

I have friends that reach out and invite me to things, I know they'd care. There are a few coworkers that would care.

But I keep having these doubts and insecurities about it. I always seek reassurance and even when I get it I still have trouble accepting it.

I always overthink things and come to the worst conclusions first. Literally like 95% of my overthinking's have been wrong. I see something and immediately think these people are ghosting me or talking shit or lying to me or whatever and then later I find out the truth and it really was something completely innocent and unrelated to me.

Its always the same pattern but I cant ever trust or accept that everything's fine.

I ALWAYS seek out the worst in situations even though it pretty much never happens. Like I said, just about 95% of my insecure overthinking is wrong, but every time I get a inkling of doubt I come to the shittiest conclusion and stress myself out.",Stoicism,1701337607.0,t3_187ewam,0.91,31

I want to survive this painfully subjective pain but for context, it all started when my girlfriend of 18 months cheated off on me and treated me in a way such that even my counselor thinks that i’m emotionally abused. After all of those, my mind wouldn’t align with my emotions. I know i deserve better (probably attachment issues) but i still long for her.Fast forward, my parents went through divorce— my mom cheating on my stepfather. It felt painful as well as it somehow a cause of my relapse from the break up i had with my cheater gf. Though im getting through the intricate pain it confronts me with, I feel either nothing or disdain towards my mother. My brother and I are to meet the new guy my mom’s with.

The environment im in isn’t much that of a niceplace, relatives that surround are quite loud and impatient (it runs in our blood) everything’s stressing me out i tend to just sleep throughout which is counterproductive especially that i base off my self worth on my academic performance (this is probably due to how  some people especially my ex and her friends belittling me, breaking off because i wasn’t “out of their league” after all the efforts and care I gave her throughout.)

The little irritations,"Hi, people, in the last month I developed a passion for stoicism and I started reading and learning more about this philosophy. In addition, I do journalling from time to time, however, I have one issue in my character that is constantly making me unhappy.

I get angry or irritated by small stuff, which most of the time are IN my control. I have already been able to let go of trying to control events that I have no control over. ( “The more you seek to control external events, the less control you will have over your own life.” Epictetus)

I can describe myself as a more clumsy person. Sometimes when I drop on accident an item on the floor or get stuck in traffic, I get angry.. When I feel exhausted at the office, I get angry... I believe that life is too short to be angry at things that do not influence me in a direct way or my family. My father most of the time is nervous and I got that trait from him, I guess, when I was growing up. Do not get me wrong.. I have no hate against other individuals and I am a person who forgives very easily (This is something that really brings me joy by the way.)

I never hold grudges. Am I a pushover or am I just being wise?,"Since I was very young, I’ve always resonated with the quote “Holding Onto Anger Is Like Drinking Poison and Expecting the Other Person to Die”

I sometimes temporarily get really sad or heartbroken or disappointed. But I rarely get too angry. Whenever someone does me wrong, I always try to see things from their perspective. 

I have zero malice or anger towards any ex lovers or ex friends. Often, I’ll even still have a little love for them. Some of them, if they have really betrayed my trust and try to get back into my life, I will say no because I don’t want to feel the pain of getting hurt again. That’s only if I feel like they are untrustworthy but not because I feel anger or resentment towards them. But it takes alot for me to even feel this. 

I worry that sometimes I am too forgiving and I wonder if I am just being too complacent and not able to think to see my worth by being too empathetic. 

So back to my question - am I just being a pushover or am I taking a mature stance on situations like this?

Also I am reminded by this quote by Epictetus, “Any person capable of angering you becomes your master; he can anger you only when you permit yourself to be disturbed by him.”

New to Stoicism: Found my role model public figure,"I (38 M) am relatively new to Stoicism. I have been aware of the general concept for a while, but I have recently started reading credible modern works and scratched the surface of the original classic philosophical writings.

I have been thinking about modern role models who exemplify Stoicism in their daily lives and conduct, in an attempt to study their behavior and learn from real-world examples in today's society. I immediately ignored all the online influencers who peddle a modern alpha-male view of Stoicism and say that we should all be stone-faced and emotionless and work our our thoughts in the gym. 

After thinking for a while, I have settled on Queen Elizabeth II as a role model. She seems to have implemented Stoicism quite successfully in her life, both in public and private. First of all, she is a model of duty and service. Unlike the modern stone-faced take of Stoicism, Queen Elizabeth exhibited many emotions in public, including joy, sadness, frustration, strength, and compassion. It is clear to me however, that her persona and public display of emotion were backed by deep thought and consideration of an appropriate reaction to events. There are times when she cried or wiped away tears in public, both in reaction to national and personal tragedies. There are times where she also exhibited immense joy in public, again both in reaction to personal and national events. 

As somebody whose personal life was on national display and under scrutiny, it makes sense that her actions were the result of reflection and consideration. With the stress of international politics, a dissolving empire and modernizing world, wars, family strife, and everything else that comes with being Head of State, I think that Queen Elizabeth would never have been so successful or popular had she not implemented principles of Stoicism, whether deliberately or not.

I am trying to draw lessons from her life as an example for me. While our situations are obviously very different, I think that I can still learn lessons. I have three kids, a wife, a stressful job with long hours, and finances are always on my mind. It has become harder and harder to manage my responsibilities, the needs of my family, and everything else that life throws at me.

Delving into classical Stoicism over the past few months has helped me realize that how I instinctually react to situations was not the example of rational consideration that I am trying to teach my children. I have already implemented lessons from my reading and observation, and I can tell that I am improving and growing. I'm excited to continue on my journey.

What to do with the regret and sadness of what happened in the past?,"I would like some advice, and I am hoping you Stoics have some food for thought on my problem:

  
I went to grad school in a different country 10 years ago, and during those two years, I had a personal fallout with a person that affected me so strongly, that I started to develop a depression that would take me about 5 year to finally start getting out of. During my studies, I did not develop deep friendships, as I began to withdraw from people due to my mental state. I moved away after graduating, and moved to another country and capital city. There I struggled with my depression for 4 years and then moved back to my own country. Here in my own country, I started to get better and have with the help of psychology left my mental problems behind.

My challenge is that I still feel a deep sadness for what I lost during those 5 years of depression - no university friendships, not even strong friendships in the capital city that I lived in for 4 years (as I was coping with my condition and couldn't get close to people) - and now, in my mid 30s, see that most people my age have their great university friends and friends from living abroad - and feel that I am constantly being confronted with my ""wound"". I guess I regret that what happened happened, and I wish things had been different.

What can I do? I even find myself meeting people who studied at my grad school (not at the same time, but it's a famous school) and I feel deeply sad and also a bit shameful when we have to ""share"" experiences and they tell me about all their great times and now life-long friends.

I thought about starting a new grad school experience, but since most people would be in their 20s, I have a gut feeling that it would not make good what happened back then... I guess that I am longing for going back to that time and relive it again, this time changning it, but because I am older now, that is not possible for me.

I have some people I talk to and I am social enough to have conversations and do my work right. But I am not someone that opens up or trusts people very quick, thus having no real friends. 

I understand where this problem comes from and I know humans need social contacts and I know that it is for the best to help others, because that is a person's goal in this life, but somehow I feel like I can't do it 100% right because people gave me this trauma in my past and it may always be a scar.

I don't feel like I need, or even want, friends or lots of people I can trust, but isn't that a bad way to think? On the other hand, i do enjoy helping others and seeing others happy.

As for stoicism, we (as human beings) are trying to make our own decision without any external influences affecting us, correct?",Stoicism,1701185827.0,t3_185yum7,0.8,6

"question regarding Epictitus, religion and God","TL/DR: How do those of you who are atheist or agnostic deal with Epictitus teachings regarding God ?

so ive been practicing stoicism for a couple years. ive read Seneca, M.A, and the Enchiridion with some selected writings from the Discourses thrown in. Recently i picked up a full length version of Discourses. Epictitus talks a lot about God. we should follow God, man is the rational beast that got the gift to make use of impressions from God. etc.

While i have my own spiritual beliefs, i've never been okay with the idea of GOD. one God, one creator, calling God 'he'.

so my question is mostly aimed at atheists and agnostics; How do you get around Epictitus \~preaching\~ about God in this way. I like his teachings but i just dont vibe with the idea of God like he does.

i dont want to hear quotes, im interested in ya'lls personal opionions

lets have a good discussion

How can i be consistent with my reactions and my beliefs?,"I experience impulsive reactions sometimes, and sometimes I catch them and sometimes I don’t. I usually apologise for them, but I also try to learn from them. It’s very difficult to find clarity and it feels like my mind is narrow whenever I face heavy emotions, I started meditating 30 minutes a day and it already does help a bit, but I could use some stoic advice to help me create the awareness and space I need to act accordingly with the cardinal virtues and principles of stoicism.",Stoicism,1701167215.0,t3_185syzp,1.0,3
Getting started with stoicism,"I came across some Stoicism videos on YouTube when I was going through a rough patch and they really helped me cope.

I find the stoic philosophy very appealing and I admire Epictetus the most.

I want to adopt Stoicism as my personal way of life, not something like a religion that is imposed on me by birth.

How can I begin my journey with Stoicism? How can I apply its principles to my real life situations? I would appreciate some advice from people who are succesfully practicing stoicism in their daily lives.

Thank you!",Stoicism,1701165225.0,t3_185shf5,0.87,15
"Stoicism, Working Hard & Cancer","I am 35 years old and last year I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. It was big, but fortunately not that dangerous. I went through the thyroid removal procedure and then radioactive iodine therapy. I had a checkup in may and I have a more serious checkup in January. 

I afraid of this checkup. 

In general my illness affected my thinking about life. On one hand it taught me to enjoy everyday life and not to wait with my plans (for example travelling). On the other it affected my plans and ambitions in the negative way. 

What's the point of investing and saving money seriously if I my life can be ended soon? What's the point of learning new things if I could spend this time enjoying myself. What's the point of taking life seriously? 

In general for me it's constant thinking about my mortality (memento mori). It's like having grim reaper standing behind me all the time. unfortunately it's not a fully positive motivation for taking actions. It's rather demotivating me. 

Did any of you had similar experiences? I would love to talk with people that gone through something like this and learning how did it affected them.

My biggest life mistake was wanting to live an easy life,"2023 summons this the best, I didn’t want to exercise, diet, barely studied, barely did anything useful, expected my friend to do all the work for me, procrastinated a lot by saying that “tomorrow I start to do this”, got addicted to porn, tried to be a people pleaser (even going against some of my own believes), etc 

I regressed a lot as a person and what  were my rewards for wanting to live an easy life basically in autopilot with no logic and following just pure emotions ? Anxiety, memory issues, suicidal thoughts, weight gain, burnout, a lot of extra final exams that almost cost me a full semester, almost lost some of my friendships, i got way behind my peers and didn’t get my driver’s license 

Growing up I was never pushed/expected to do great things, if I was average that was enough for my parents and me, my mom basically did my homework for me, I would eat and watch tv all day and not leave the apartment and no one would care, so I never developed discipline, sense of urgency and maturity 

I have my ups and downs but basically to this day I lack those core elements and the 4 stoic principles 

With no temperance no self discipline nor control so I will waste my days with pleasurable things and just “do the important things tomorrow”, even tho nothing guarantees me a tomorrow

With no wisdom no intelligence and resourcefulness making me have bad grades at my college and be afraid to treat patients (I’m learning to be a dentist but I don’t reread core concepts such as anesthesia so I just ask my friend to do all the work for me at the clinic)

With no courage no scape from my comfort zone so I don’t try to improve myself 

With no justice I abandon my principles of wanting to be a good man and focus only on pleasing people and not strengthening or even developing a sense of character 

I hope that this serves me as an experience of what living a shallow existence is and how to always try to be better than yourself from yesterday (even if it takes baby steps)",Stoicism,1705691126.0,t3_19aqv6w,0.99,30
How does one stop being so emotional?,"
Hello,

A few months ago, I stumbled upon stoicism, and I've been thoroughly enjoying immersing myself in its teachings and practicing to become a true stoic, striving to be the best version of myself. However, I find that I'm facing a challenge in effectively harnessing my emotions. I comprehend that the teachings emphasize the practice of refraining from expressing unnecessary emotions, but I'm particularly struggling with becoming less emotional, especially in my interactions with other people. How can one navigate the path to emotional restraint and cultivate a more stoic approach, particularly in interpersonal relationships?

Even though I have researched and tried to apply my findings of stoicism, I feel that the one thing I still struggle to control is my emotional decision-making.

It’s easy to say to yourself “stop being emotional,” but I find it’s counterintuitive, especially if you encounter situations that will strike an intense emotion.

I appreciate your feedback.",Stoicism,1705688478.0,t3_19apsri,1.0,9

Does stoicism care anything about how simplistic or grand your goals are?,"I've been thinking a lot about meaning lately, and I guess I'm in somewhat of a crisis. 

I know a lot of people in the world might say that if you want meaning or purpose in your life you need a respectable goal. Which, on the surface, I can understand. 

My concern is that...what does it mean if you can't? What if you fail? We're all prone to do so. What if other obligations come along and you have to give up your dreams? What if you become disabled? What if you straight up die the very day you decide on a goal? 

I'm not saying that if someone is dreaming of being an astronaut they should just give up. But should our goals be where we find meaning and contentment?

Today I will begin a path of gratitude,"4 years ago, coming out of high school. I experienced mental struggles that changed myself and the way I view life. For over a year, I struggled with severe depression and anxiety. While it did get a bit better, these mental issues underlied my time in college. They were related to regret, guilt, and insecurity.

4 years later in the present. I'm honestly in a position I never thought I'd be in. I've gained a lot of personal confidence, lost social anxiety, have a great girlfriend, and will be starting a job after college making more money than I could ever imagine.

But still, lately I've found myself more low than normal. Starting to spiral down into some of my old thoughts. Which are triggered by specific things that I won't get into. These past years, I don't think i've ever truly felt peaceful and free, at best I could push my thoughts away and try to ignore them. 

4 years of overthinking, dark thoughts, self-doubt, anxiety, closing myself off to others. What did I gain from that? Nothing at all. Just lost time.

Today I will try to being a path of gratitude and perspective. I cannot base my happiness on my current situation. I need to appreciate everyday as it is, not regretting the past or worrying about the future. I need to focus my energy into the things I can improve on and control, my work, the gym, building friendships, my relationships etc.

"What would be the Stoic approach to dating and finding love? Is it even worth me, as a man, trying my hand at dating?","Long story short: I’m 28 years old and have never been on a date, and thus never been in a relationship. I’ve never known love outside of that given by my parents. And I also never had friends growing up and thus spent the majority of my life alone. That was until recently when I finally managed to acquire two genuine friends. 

To put it simply, I’m lonely. I feel an emptiness inside me that no amount of Lexapro (antidepressant medication) can seem to fix. I want the feeling of waking up next to someone I love and feeling genuinely happy. But I also know how hard it is for men in our day and age to find romance/love and how dating apps can be like bottomless pits of swiping over and over again, just hoping and praying one girl out of 100 will match with you. But even then, there’s a good chance she’ll ghost you just because. It all seems so hopeless. 

But, I also know the Stoics would say things like “Your happiness should not be dependent on the people in your life and the value you place on them”. And I just don’t know how to reconcile the Stoic philosophy and finding true inner peace and tranquility with my desires I want out of life and not wanting to be lonely anymore.",Stoicism,1705586183.0,t3_199qp1t,0.88,46
I'm putting myself down because of my thoughts,"







I'm so sick and tired of myself. I just don't understand why am I not taking actions in life to improve my life. It seems like I'm just living a meaningless life, where I can't find any enthusiasm optimistica. It's always ""sighs"" feeling whenever I even try to think of doing something.

You already accepted failure and aren't doing anything to change. If I just keep going this way, then history will repeat year after year. I wanna get out of my head. I want to change my mindset. I have too and need too change. I told myself I want to start driving so I could become more independent. So I can go college in campus and find jobs that are far.

I need a stoic solution on how to deal with an issue in my relationship.,"Hi, my (F30) husband (M32) have different levels of affection whereby I am more affectionate and love spending quality time, hugs, kisses, asking about his day etc whereas this doesn't seem to occur to him naturally. Therefore I always feel deprived of affection and acknowledgement very often. It's as simple as not being acknowledged when I walk into the house after a workday, barely even looks in my direction and I have to initiate a Hi let alone a kiss. When I initiate he does respond but this is wearing on me since it would be nice to have that without asking for it. I have expressed this multiple times but he changes for awhile and goes back to old patterns soon after. I'm beginning to grow resentful especially because this last week and part of this week I have really struggled mentally and would have loved a genuine ""How was your day today?"". I would also love hearing ""I love you"" without having to say it first. So I decided to mirror his behaviour and not Initiate any of my usual affection and conversation, we've been quiet for 2 days. I wonder if I should focus on controlling my own actions as recommended by stoicism and maybe seek the affection elsewhere? Or maybe not give affection either so that I don't feel short changed and hence protect my peace of mind. His family is the same way, naturally dull and cold and have an almost professional relationship unlike mine that is very much affectionate hence my personality.

What’s the point,"Hey everyone. I got into stoicism about a year ago while I was having some family problems and the philosophy helped me get through those times. 

Because of Marcus Aurelius I started reflecting on my death a lot more. Originally this was helpful as it helped me put a lot of things into perspective. I realised how temporary my problems were.

However I’ve been thinking about death almost all the time for the past few weeks to the point where I don’t see the point in most things. I’m in college and used to be really focussed on my career and working out but now I feel like why should I bother being the best version of myself or strive towards being virtuous if it’s so temporary. Does it matter if I live according to my nature if I’m gonna be dead anyway? The advice I’ve gotten is to be good for the people around me but even their lives seem so temporary. The idea that humans exist for each other seems like a chicken and egg problem. Ironically the more Momento Mori i do the more anxious I feel.

"I do not recommend ""How to be a Stoic"" by Massimo Pigliucci","When I started this book, I expected a philosophical manual on Stoicism, at the end of a most underwhelming read however, what was delivered was a poorly written and thinly disguised self-help book.

&#x200B;

It started out decently enough though, a brief history of the philosophy, followed by an examination of its main tenets. All the good in it was contained in the first 20% and even then there were traces of the navel-gazing to come. Everything after... shockingly poor.

&#x200B;

Never have I seen an author miss the mark so much. The decision to write this in first-person only served to show how flawed the author is, all of his biases and prejudices were laid bare. A better title for this book should have been ""How to be Massimo Pigliucci"", every chapter was littered with entirely boring and braggadocios anecdotes of a man who evidently thinks himself an embodiment of humility, modesty and fine character. You would see interesting chapter titles that ended up being neither informative or thought-provoking, for someone who never missed the opportunity to tell the reader how non-religious he is, the whole book had an air of boring preachiness about it.

Practical advice to not dwell/feel guilt on past mistakes/regret,"When you make mistakes, big ones. Ones that might change the trajectory of your life. It's hard not to dwell on them.

It's very easy for me spiral into overthinking mistakes. Part of it is due to my perfectionist personality. The past few years for me have been rough to say the least. At times very low, but at times I felt happy and found joy in life.

Like I said, I often spiral into deep places of guilt at what I've done, anger at myself, anxiety towards the future, and so much regret that I just feel hopeless towards life. How can I help myself when this is happening.

Some things I try to tell myself.

\- Comparison is useless, I will always hurt myself looking for what I lack in others.

Stoicism is incredible !,"Hey friends, I didn't imagine that a philosophy could impact me so much in such a short amount of time. It's just incredible.

I discovered Stoicism recently, and to be honest, I didn't believe much in the effect. Out of curiosity, I started delving deeper, and just wow, it resonated so much with me and really improved my mind. I found peace with myself. The idea that life is about balance; I found that controlling your actions is not achieved by fighting your emotions, but by accepting your emotions at their fullest and letting them express inside you. Little by little, I began to feel a kind of moment where you face your mind, and you see your feelings taking over. With time, I feel more and more able to see clearer and take better decisions and I'll be happy to learn more.

Do you guys recommend any philosophies in the same direction? Thanks",Stoicism,1705533553.0,t3_199azff,0.89,29
Determinism vs Free will,"From what I know the stoics claim that everything is determined by fate, yet at the same time they claim that humans have the ability to control their thoughts.

"'[...] Certainly it has made the inferior in the interests of the superior and has connected the superior one with another. You see how it has subordinated, co-ordinated, and allotted to each its due and brought the ruling creatures into agreement one with another.' Book 5, Paragraph 30, Meditations","
Adding:

'[...] For it has been proved long ago that we are born for fellowship; or was it not plain that the inferior creatures are in the interests of the superior, the superior of one another? But the animate are superior to the inanimate and the reasoning to the merely animate.' (Book 5, Paragraph 16, Meditations)

-----------------------------------------------------------

Hey, this quote(s) left a big questionmark on my mind, so I'm here for some input to understand them correctly. I conclude I've got more then one question to ask as they built up on each other.

(1) It translates to me that the old stoics distinguish between valuable and less valuable people.

(2) If my first impression (1) is right, why do high valuable people and superior only be the interest of likewise people and the inferiorjust existng just for the earlier mentioned? Why is the superior not helping the inferior to rise or at least show a new way of being and try to practice it? It seems that inferiors are only in the equation to look up to the rational ones (At first without judging it, just what it seems objektive. Later on it seems arrogant.).

I guess it's the distinguish between people who serve stoicism no matter what stage there on and the other people. A second or more detailed guess is that they distinguish between those who think, act and behave for the community/social mind and those who lay on them because they don't bring something valuable into it.
(3) Am I even close with my guesses?


From actually looking in our society we indeed have people who think, act, behave, yeah work and live for the society and e.g. others who can't or simply don't bring that much value into it and need to rely on others help, get cure or a financial minimum (at least to live) etc. We could see them as 'less valuable' because of the different input we all put in the big pot. Also thinking of disabiltys some people experience. But everybody is gifted individually and although I see those more- or less-'valuable' people in society, I wouldn't morality-wise treat them less respectful or think of them like less of a human being. Indeed it is humanly.

I slightly remember (might remember wrong) that Seneca said that as a stoic and aiming for getting wise you need to sort of break contact with those who aren't on the same path. Like choosing not to deal with them.

Please correct me if wrong or missing anything.)

Those are the top on my mind questions. Thanks for reading, I'm looking forward to your thoughts, knowledge and experience!",Stoicism,1705594890.0,t3_199twc6,0.5,0
What are some actionable steps to practice Stoicism?,"Recently I've been making a planned effort to study philosophy everyday, where previously I'd just passively consume information as my Youtube and Reddit algorithms put it in front of me. 

I've been primarily reading about Buddhism, and some Taoism as well. What I like about Buddhism, is that it is very clear about the steps you must go through in order to attain enlightenment. You must follow the Eightfold Path in order to attain enlightenment, and each step has very clear instructions. 

For example, Step 1 is to understand the Four Noble Truths, Step 2 is to internalize them and allow wholesome actions to naturally flow forth. Steps 3,4, and 5 precisely tell you what actions are wholesome or unwholesome and clear up any gray areas. Step 6 instructs you how to remove the 5 Hindrances (mindsets that hold you back from enlightenment), and cultivate the 7 factors of awakening (positive mental states). I haven't gotten to steps 7 and 8 in my studies yet, as step 6 is very dense with information. I'm getting this information via Ajahn Sona from this playlist of videos https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCXN1GlAupG0_DzIOFNrDSp0fTwTLkTxV&si=fiBpd9SM2c4m8XRA

I was wondering if Stoicism had similar actionable steps. I'm familiar with Memento Mori and the following quote from Meditations:

""[2.1] When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they cannot tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me.""

I was wondering if you know of any other actionable steps that can be taken in Stoicism, like there is in Buddhism. 

Also, from what I understand, Stoicism seems to be a reactionary philosophy. It seems to suggest waiting until something offends us, then rationally choosing a reaction during the time between stimulus and response. Buddhism seems to be more proactive however, allowing me to exert energy in order to remove the 5 hindrances, and giving me a task of cultivating healthy mental states via the process of meditation and mindfulness/metacognition. What do you think about this interpretation?

I made a very similar post in the /r/Taoism if you'd be inclined to see their responses. I enjoy learning about Buddhism, Taoism, and Stoicism; they seem to have a lot of overlap. The answers from that subreddit may potentially help you develop a deeper understanding of Stoicism if you're so inclined.",Stoicism,1705605483.0,t3_199y6r7,0.38,0

Example of daily Journaling,"Today at the grocery someone was backing out of a spot. I didn't see them until I was already behind them. I just kept driving because legally I had the right away. They laid on their horn. Now I didnt get mad and I didn't get worked up. I did get out of the car after parking knowing that they were about to drive past. I didn't want to seem like I was hiding or avoiding them as im trying to become more comfortable facing conflict, this is something ive struggled with my entire life. I also got out with a smile waved and started to say sorry. But the guy cut me off with some attitude ""boy you don't know how to drive do you"" (SO MEAN RIGHT?!🤣) here is were I lost sight. I got a annoyed and said something about how I was going to apologize but if he wants to be an ass we can be assholes. I could of just said. You know what man. Im sorry. In my defense me and my wife were talking about how she is currently having a miscarriage and I haven't really had a chance to grief and process the loss. So my emotions might of been a little off. 

In this situation there are a few things I could of done better. 1. Not let his comment annoy me into getting into a play ground argument. If he's not physically coming at me there is no reason to engage and 'save face'. Just apologize and move on with life.
2. I got a little bit of an adrenaline dump from arguing with him. This tells me I was looking into the future and the possibility of a fight from having words with him. If words are to be had then have them and be in that moment at that time and only get ready for a fight if a fight is about to happen. ""I have to die. If it is now, well then I'll die now. If it is later then now I will take my lunch"" 
3. After I walked away and into the store I was still worked up and it took some time to really come down and let go. I was still replaying the moment in my head. But not in a ""could I have done that better way"" in a ""I could of said this, that dude was such an asshole, I would of kicked that dudes ass"" way.

"Hell, Camus, and the Ancient Stoics","I have a thought experiment and a question for y'all. 

**(The setup)**

Imagine that on the Day of Judgement, God, the Christian god, banishes the ancient Stoics to Hell. 

There are many Christian views on Hell, but let's suppose this Hell is an *inescapable*, *eternal* stream of *torment*. 

I know there are many Christians on this sub. Out of respect for their faith, let's not argue but simply suppose that the Ancient Stoics come to the conclusion that the Christian God is unjustful and thus not worthy of worship. Their claim is that an inescapable, eternal stream of torment is unjustifiable and inappropriate for punishment for whatever ""sins"" they committed in their finite lifetimes. If humans can forgive their persuctors, they reason, then surely the ""all loving"" Christian God can forgive. And if humans have the instinct to correct, rather than just punish, bad behavior , surely the ""all loving"" Christian God would eventual seize the torment so that people could reintegrate back into a relationship with God. 

**(The question)**

What attitude would the Ancient Stoics take in Hell? How would they handle themselves in Hell?

To be clear, this is just speculation. I speculate the Stoics would forgive the Christian God. I would imagine them like Camus said of Sisyphus:  *One must imagine Sisyphus happy*

And I would even imagine Epictutus whispering to himself:

> To incarceration. Do I have to complain about it? To exile. Is there anyone stopping me from going with a smile, joyful and content? ... **You'll shackle my leg, but not even Zeus can conquer my will.** 'I'll throw you in prison. My body. 'I'll cut off your head? Well, have you ever heard me suggest that I'm unique in having a non-detachable head?

How to turn an obstacle into an opportunity?,"I am struggling to find the opportunity in the obstacle. This is where I call upon your help. Please be gentle, I am a sad raccoon 🦝

Three years ago, I lost my job caring for a sick previously estranged family member (dementia and alcoholism-based physical complications). I had no support from anyone so I fell into debt paying bills and rent and groceries. One family member stepped in, making all sorts of  allegations and being outright abusive in a bid to get total control of my dad's finances. I was proven innocent again and again, but nonetheless it all took a terrible mental toll and I eventually had to step back for my own health.  The whole situation lasted around three years and every moment was awful. I managed to find another job within a few months of losing my last, which I dislike and pays badly.

I'm trying to move past it all but with the debt at £12,000 (I pay it down and it just gets bigger every year at 47% interest) I'm finding it hard. I've been job hunting for a better salary to outpace the interest as I'm currently underpaid where I am but I've had terrible luck. 

I was offered one job after around seven interviews, for example, then the offer was rescinded because the company decided to freeze all hiring. Situations like this have happened repeatedly, where I'm unsure how my actions could have created a better outcome and I'm doing everything ""right"" on the surface. I have given up on job hunting for now and am trying to accept and be grateful for the job I do have.

This has increased the sense of desperation, as the job I lost caring for my father was awesome and paid well, and I feel like I'm not going to be able to get back to that again. This increases my resentment towards the situation, like it's a reminder how many steps back it's pushed me.  

I am also very physically unwell, recovering from three years worth of burnout, but I cannot take any significant amount of time off because my company does not pay sick pay. In fact, they threatened to fire me if I took more than a fortnight off. I exercise a lot, take medication and eat healthily but am so very, very weary and generally sad all the time. 

I am also unable to get the medication that would help my newly diagnosed disability, which apparently compounded the stress of caring for my dad, due to a long waiting list in my country's healthcare system. 

I think about all I did caring for my dad, all the things I fixed for him, like chasing down scammers to get back money and using that to organise his care, and how it helped him and the family member that savagely betrayed me but just set me back so far. 

What opportunity can I find in this adversity? 

I regret doing it. My dad abandoned me as a child and it was foolish of me to help him.  My friends say I should be proud of helping him when he was so terrible to me but I don't really see what the virtue in that is. I mostly feel stupid. I'm struggling to see what I can learn from this or how it has been anything other than a a series of cruel circumstances drawn yet again from having an abusive, screwed up family. Other than, maybe, I should have just left him to die. But that doesn't feel right at all. But perhaps it is? Perhaps that is the opportunity? Or is just plain acceptance the way forward? 

So please, help me find the silver lining, the opportunity in the obstacle, so to speak. I feel that if I can extract meaning from it I can move in. It's been a year since I stepped back from the majority of my duties, and I still cause myself suffering over it all the time. 

I'd like to cultivate peace and moving on from it rather than the daily resentment, grief, self-hatred and desperation. I know some of this is my C-PTSD and how it all triggered a lot of trauma, but a lot, honestly, feels spiritual and mental, like I can't make my world right after it.

I've been practising Stoicism alongside general philosophy and meditation for awhile. I also go to weekly therapy and exercise for up to two hours daily for fitness and anger processing.

Scary lawyer letter,"Everyone probably heard about these letters, knows someone who received them, or received them themselves. Lawyers keep sending these letters because they are effective. People get scared and pay even if they have no obligation. For example, in some countries, media companies hire lawyers to send these letters to people who pirate movies, demanding payment to avoid a lawsuit.

From a Stoic perspective, these letters are ink on paper - nothing more. It's up to you to decide what you think and what you do. If you feel anxious, the letter is not causing it. It's your brain that is taking the bait. 

I never cared about these letters, but it's always a few days of drama when a household member picks them up from a mailbox. Since they don't understand the law, they already imagine someone coming to our house and taking possession of our household items because of ""debt"" or me ending up in jail for years.

How to deal with Anger and Discomfort during banter among friends.,"I have this group of friends that I hang out with sometimes. Where, I don't feel like I am being myself when I am with them. Sometimes they throw banter at me and laugh. I initially took it lightly. But when they repeatedly use the same joke (which is not even funny tbh), I get irritated and angry. I don't show it but I feel like my ego is getting shattered. I usually want to create an impression about myself where I want to be treated with respect. I respect others too.

I have other friends too. With whom I am very comfortable. I speak my heart out when I am with them, unlike the friend group I talked about above, where I would always be on my toes and want the conversation to end.

SouthAsian Narc mother causing me issues that directly impact my life and beyond my control. How to proceed?,"My SouthAsian narc mother is making my life hell from far away in another country. She is the kind who will go to extreme lengths that directly impacts your life (e.g. calling up your workplace and generally ruining your work life) that you have very little control over OR you need to mitigate or defuse it afterwards but the damage has already been done. The only thing I can do is NOT stress out and fix MY things where she breaks them. This caused me to start over multiple times.  

Problem: Now she is spreading rumours about me and my partner about me being abused by him. Solution - we can ignore it as it does not impact my life directly. 

Problem: She is calling me every moment, bombarding me with messages which is literally causing me to physically hyperventilate and increased blood pressure. Solution - i can block them on phone after writing a short message not to call me so that they don't think I am dead.  

Problem: She may come to my place unannounced and me being unprepared. Now this does directly impact me. I do not know how to deal with this if she suddenly appears at my door. Solution? - I take her to an airbnb or dump her with my potential mother in law so she can diffuse the tension for me. This is just one idea. 

I don't know if I am doing this correctly. I am severely stressed, shaking and generally want to block them all without explanation because this is literally psychotic behaviour and I realised it too late. ",Stoicism,1705490397.0,t3_198uayi,0.57,1

On top of that, it had been a personally rough year for me and my family. Needless to say, I was nervous. 

I had no reason to be. His review overall was very positive. I learned a lot about his point of view on the friction we’ve had and took away some pointers. I don’t agree with all of his feedback, but I can’t deny that it was fairly delivered with adequate detail.

An Unorthodox Method To Deal With Anxiety,"In this post, I will present what I consider to be an unorthodox method of dealing with anxiety and what I will dare to call, anxious thinking. 

**Cause**

It is possible that, at this moment, you are going through a particularly tense, difficult, or painful situation in your life and think that your anxiety is the direct, natural consequence of events in your social, family, or work environment.

However, the cause of your anxiety is not found in what you are currently experiencing; instead, it lies in the future that you believe you will have to face. Your mind is filled with repetitive thoughts about imaginary scenarios in which that catastrophic future will occur.

What causes your anxiety is not a specific situation you are experiencing but the imagination of something much worse, which your mind categorically classifies as unbearable.

**The Method**

How to deal, then, with anxious thinking? How to overcome chaotic, repetitive thoughts in an imaginary scenario that torments us? The method I propose is to imagine the worst, to think about the scenario that torments you.

I dare to classify this method as unorthodox because it goes against what we intuitively would like to do to avoid anxiety: avoid thinking about what we fear. However, analogues of this method can be found even in various ancient philosophies, among which Stoicism is no exception.

The idea is to observe the same imaginary scenarios that generate anxiety, but really analyze them, view them as another possible option calmly, rather than as an event that will inevitably occur in a way that is categorically incompatible with our existence. The reason these thoughts obsessively cause us anxiety is that our mind unquestionably classifies them as unbearable.

Likewise, just thinking about them calmly is a very powerful weapon to drive away anxiety. We must remember that, evolutionarily, the goal of these repetitive thoughts is to prepare us for plausible future scenarios and obtain useful intuitions about how to act in response to them.

However, individuals experiencing anxious thinking are unable to use imagination as a source of knowledge, only as a source of fear. When possible worrying scenarios appear in their minds, the anxious individual gets stuck in them, going round and round through chaotic, repetitive thoughts.

But if, following the original evolutionary objective of these thoughts, we delve into the imagination of possible solutions, our thoughts will not generate the same anxiety. By doing this, we put ourselves in a situation where we internalize them as past events that have already occurred.

Seeing them through this key is much simpler because it is not difficult to face a past situation, which, like any other, is just a fact against which we will have to act.",Stoicism,1705424826.0,t3_1987x3d,0.91,9
Emotions,"Suppressing immediate emotions in order to process and make sense of them. 

For some, it takes some time to go through that processing stage and that can certainly frustrate those expecting that immediate emotional response/feedback…where it may be warranted. 

I recently had a conversation with an individual who asked if those raw emotions get watered down the longer one takes to process them.  I keep thinking about this and I guess in a way they could/do. 

I’m not entirely sure how to word this question, but I guess I’m hoping to hear how people practicing stoicism respond/react to others with that initial raw emotion in a logical manner. 

I apologize if this seems a bit scrambled.",Stoicism,1705444561.0,t3_198g68y,0.83,4
Handwashing,"So, some back story. I struggle with anxiety and one of my anxiety symptoms is excessive handwashing to the point of irritated, sometimes slightly bleeding, hands, because I fear germs.

Brother is obsessed with Andrew Tate,"My brother, a 17 year old, lives by Andrew Tate’s “philosophy” as if it were the law. 

I didn’t know anything about him until I started to get into the root cause of my brother’s behavior. 

It’s a complete bastardization of stoicism. Just unbelievable how selfish his behavior has become. 

He shows no respect for our father, who is elderly now. No respect for anyone other than himself. I’m not going to go into details because it’s a long list. 

After briefly reviewing some of the Tate “ideologies,” I’ve come to realize justice is an afterthought. 

Yes, I know. He’s a 17 year old boy. 17 year olds are selfish. I was at one point. However, it seems out of control now and I don’t know how to mentor him properly. 

I’m 33. He’s my half brother. Father is a single parent with 3 other half brothers to look out for. Very clear he received minimal discipline. 

I try my best to mentor the boys because my father needs the help. 

I’ve been away in the army for the better part of the 17 year olds life. I’m not worried, I don’t fear the outcome. I know it’s his choice. However, while he’s still in the house, I would like to make an impact because it’s very apparent that it will cause him hardship when he’s moved out. 

This kid is the “cock of the walk.”

Here’s a brief description. 

17 years old, 6’4”, 250 lbs, all state football, Jock, Smart. He proclaims he’s the Alpha of the school. I cringe just typing that sentence. 

Any advice welcome.




Edit: I see why people would construe my words as jealousy. I said I wasn’t going to go into the details because it’s a long list, here’s a recent example. 

Last month he stole one of my father’s credit cards and spent $3500 in 20 days before we saw the statement. He was going out and taking friends to nice dinners, Uber eats to school for lunch, bought a membership to a health club, buying clothes he didn’t need…

When confronted by my Father, he showed no remorse by saying he simply “needed money.” The only thing I’ve said to him was, “I’m disappointed in your actions.” He avoids me like the plague now.

As for the reason I bring up his physical attributes. My father is elderly. He can barely walk. He simply cannot discipline him due to my brothers size and mentality. It literally becomes a shoving match with my father ending up on the floor. It’s just a bad situation.",Stoicism,1705339910.0,t3_197efd1,0.9,465

I can't go on with my life like this.,"Hey.

​

Hemorrhoids have sucked the joy out of my life for the last 2 years.

I'm sitting at home, crying because I just see no light at the end of the tunnel.

I'm a very upbeat person. Always trying to see the positive. But I feel so helpless here.

​

I'm a 31 year old, (otherwise) fit male.

​

Every day I find myself anxious or uncomfortable about the most mundane things.

Sitting on the subway. Driving a car. Walking. I lost my ability to relax.

​

I constantly feel my hems and they get worse during the day. Every evening I wish

my life was different. I envy every person that doesn't have to deal with this.

I love to do a lot of sports. Now I'm too scared to do hard exercise.

I don't do any activity that could lead to worse Hemis (bouldern, skiing, running, lifting). I love to do all of those things.

​

I do everything in the book that should help or prevent them.

Eat a lot of fiber, drink enough water, NEVER EVER STRAIN. Nothing helps.

​

My therapy so far:

​

Got hemorrhoids in early 2021. Got first banding in August 2021.

Got another banding. Got sclerotherapy. Got Raphaelo radiofrequency treatment.

Tried alternative healing as well (TCM etc.)

​

They were Grade 2. Now grade one, but there is still CONSTANT pressure on my fucking anus.

​

I also hate thinking about them so much. But I can't help it. It's almost an intrusive thought at this point to think about them. Even they are ""only"" grade 1 atm I can feel them every day, all the time.

​

Sometimes I have the thought, that my intrusive thinking about them makes them worse or that they would go away with me doing it. But it's impossible not to think about them. And they are connected to so much anxiety and shame. It's such a downward spiral thought process as well.

​

I want to know if I can get rid of them again in my life. But all the posts about surgery also seem horrible. And I'm not sure you could do that for grade 1-2 hemorrhoids.

I don't want to lose hope that my body can regain balance.

​

I just wanted to post it here because I had to get it out of my head.....

​

Thank you for reading.

I’ve tried many different medications to control my binge eating problem because I’m obese and pre diabetic with different results, I’ve tried to record on an app what I eat to watch my calorie intake and even slapped my face every time that I felt that an episode of binge eating was coming, but nothing worked for too long 

I’ve unsubscribed from every porn related subreddit and deleted my safari history so whenever I google something it will not appear but it did not work for too long either

The same with my YouTube I try to distract myself with other things such as books and movies just to have a better sense of time expended per entertainment, I can finish 1-2 chapters or watch a movie in 1-2 hours each and have the rest of my day off instead of watching multiple videos of 50 minutes a day

Irony in morning meditation," Recently,  I stumbled upon stoicism by reading a couple books. I've struggled through much of my life looking for philosophy that matches what I believe. Stoicism feels like something I can really get behind. From my perspective there are a lot of truths to it. So I'm pretty excited to be apart of it and the community.

The reason I'm writing this post is to share my new experience. While reading has been a pleasure, I'm finding the actual practice difficult. Today was a perfect example. I spent so much time angry at every little life nuisance. While walking my dogs I was angry about the traffic and other people trying to use the sidewalk. I was acting surly. I've used Marcus Aurelious 's morning meditation to help deal with co workers and other people who stress me out. Yet I turn around and act the same way they do. In a sense it's kind of funny. Like going from hero to villain. What a fucking hypocrite.

How I discovered Stoicism. How did you guys discover Stoicism?,"Technically there are a wide range of things that lead to my discovery and pursuit of Stoicism, but the main two reasons were: Breakup and David Goggins. Before I continue, **I know that David Goggins is not a Stoic.**

I read both of his books: “*Can’t Hurt Me*” and “*Never Finished*”, and it was extremely inspiring. He has been through *so much* hardship in his life that if he were to just completely fail in his life, no one would blame him. They’d excuse it under the premise that because of all the hardship he’s been through, it’s expected for him to fail. Instead of allowing the hardship to ruin the rest of his life, he used it as fuel and became a Navy Seal, an ultra-marathon runner, completed a bunch of Iron-mans, and a fucking author despite his severe learning disability. I’ve also been through much hardship; abuse (physical and sexual), homelessness, and a lot more which I will not list because…honestly it just feels odd listing it all. From his books, I learned a key lesson: It’s not what happens to you that matters, but who you are despite everything that matters.

Fast forward to the breakup, I got cheated on, discovered it was going on for a while yadda yadda. I was angry, felt humiliated, sad, hurt, but from what I learned, I decided that I can either let this break me, or I can use this situation as a challenge to maintain my character and not allow this situation to destroy me. So, I took on the challenge. Instead of acting out of anger, I had a conversation with them in order to gain understanding, I forgave them (after ending the relationship of course), and treated them with as much respect and kindness as I would to anyone else despite what they did to me, with no desire to receive any of that back. Day after day of doing this, I found myself feeling extremely happy and honestly excited. I was like “You’re telling me that a 5 year relationship just ended from cheating, and I can be THIS GOOD? Even after everything that happened?” Yes, those were sad times, but the fact that I maintained and even improved my character despite that is something that will stick with me forever. 

So, I decided to continue with the momentum by learning even more. I thought if this is something I was able to learn on my own, I can only imagine what I can learn from others. So I looked up “Books every man should read” on reddit, and found meditations. Then through meditations, I decided to join the Stoicism subreddit where I then found Epictetus’s Discourses, and the rest is history.",Stoicism,1705375683.0,t3_197sqog,0.87,6

Stoic advice on street fights,"24 M. Was physically assaulted by club staff (14 v/s 3 of us) 2 years ago. That has given me a great deal of PTSD.

I know the usual advice is to avoid physical fights. But if you’re having a confrontation with someone and they punch you first, what to do then? What if someone teases my sister or gf? What if they are being unnecessarily physically aggressive?

In such cases do I get away and call the authorities or fight?? It’s somewhat of a pride thing too. Running way from such situations feels weak and hurts my pride. 

Thinking about all this has given me great social anxiety. 

And yes, I am not afraid of getting beaten up. I don’t feel anxious in confrontations with known people. It’s only with strangers because there’s fear of death.

TLDR: Was physically assaulted a few years ago. Felt powerless and weak. Got PTSD. Now often get anxious in confrontational social interactions.",Stoicism,1705328576.0,t3_1979vf9,0.79,11
Beginner's Philosophy Book Club," This is the perfect time to join if you're new to stoicism or philosophy and looking for a supportive community to explore big questions together. We re total beginners in philosophy so there's no need for any previous knoweldge in the subject, the book club is starting from the basics and it's only a couple of months old. We just finished our first second reading, now we're starting an introductory book and that's why I'm looking for new members, if you are interested this is the perfect moment to join!

&#x200B;

**Resources**

We plan on following an average reading list for an undegraduate course in philosophy. We started with ""Think"" by Simon Blackburn, an introductory book into philosophy. If you don't have the resources, I will provide them.

**Schedule**

We meet once a week, on Sunday at 18 GMT. During these meetings we review and discuss our readings. Discussion questions on the topics at hand are be prepared beforehand, I usually use both human and AI inputs to write discussion questions but feel free to contribute in whatever way you want.

**Requisites**

* Passion. The books we are going to read are not exactly fun read if you don't like the subject matter. I've noticed that a significant amount of people get demoralized when they approach the text as they turn out differntly from they expected.
* Consistency. I plan on reading thirty-five to fifty pages a week (five to seven pages a day). It's not a huge time commitment but it is still a time commitment.
* I don't really care about age but I prefer people over 18 for this club.
* Discord, we use this platform.",Stoicism,1705345159.0,t3_197go4c,0.83,4
Maturity & growth,"I have consistently found myself viewed as the most immature of my friend group. I am 25 and live with my mom and I'm in a large amount of debt. I've constantly made excuses my whole life and it was pointed out to me recently that I try to avoid responsibility as much as possible and I'm inclined to agree. I struggle deeply with time management and being considerate of others' priorities schedule wise. Stoicism has helped me learn to see these problems within myself and begin to think before I act, however I'm finding difficulty in working through these specific problems in life. Are there any thought exercises or other stoic practices that have helped any of you with these kinds of issues?

"Kahneman and Klein (2009) stated, “a psychology of judgment and decision making that ignores intuitive skill is seriously blinkered” (p. 525).","As far as I know, Stoicism advises people to avoid making decisions or judgments by relying on their intuition or first impression. What do you guys think about the studies done on decision-making, that is on system 1 and system 2 thinking. These studies say that they both have a place in making optimal decisions. I am not talking about our brain's ability to compute the speed and angle of a ball that we can catch with the right timing. I am talking about decisions to let's say let our anger out in a situation to set some boundaries or protect ourselves without rationalising it before doing so.

Tips on managing emotions,"I have always been a highly emotional person. Feeling intense emotions is a symptom of my ADHD, so it’s basically a chemical thing in my brain that I cannot control, so I need to learn to work with it, and manage it. 

One way it’s currently affecting me is with dating. I become prematurely excited about a new connection, to the point of feeling euphoria and exhilaration after one or two conversations with a potential partner. I project all kinds of fantasies and expectations onto the connection, without having much information about who they really are. Then, when they turn out not to be as great of a match as I thought, I struggle to walk away, and feel utterly devastated at the loss, despite not having known them or really forming a relationship with them.

My Mum has cancer.,"In December, Mum was diagnosed with a cyst. It was cancerous and thankfully, they said it was localised. Recently, she had her operation to remove it. They found that the cancer was worse than they anticipated and it was spreading and that chemo is needed. They are hopeful we will win.

I prepared myself mentally. I meditate every day, I felt the emotions, I reflected on the situation, tried to accept that there is a possibilty that mum could die. I gave my very best to my mum in terms of emotional support and care. I am her shield in life (domestic abuse) and emotionally she relies on me. I promised her that the only thing I can offer is my undying and committed support to her and that we will fight to the end.

Today I went to see her for the first time after the operation. Mentally I thought I was prepared. Nothing could have ever prepared me to see my beloved mother in pain, barely speaking and full of pipes and wires. It hit and cut deep on a very emotional level.

I started to cry silently. No one wants to see their mother like this. Somehow the Stoic training kicked in. I felt myself thinking: I am a human being, it is ok to cry in a situation like this and I am feeling my emotions. It is ok. Emotions must be expressed. This is not within my control and I am operating well in the things I can control, that is my mind and actions. 

I stayed there till visiting hours were over, made sure she was comfortable, and left.

As much as I like reading and learning Stoicism, I think the biggest teacher of Stoicism is life. This terrible situation is totally out of my control, rest for my little personal actions. We have a long road ahead, but I believe with a good mindset, I will be able to navigate the stormy seas that are ahead while supporting mother.

I am sorry if this may sound like humble brag. It is just me expressing my emotions on the Stoic subreddit, where experiences like these remind me how much I still have to learn.",Stoicism,1705242563.0,t3_196h2vx,0.97,180

Meditations 5.5 for me is the definition of stoicism in a nutshell.,"“Thou sayest, Men cannot admire the sharpness of thy wits—Be it so: but there are many other things of which thou canst not say, I am not formed for them by nature. Show those qualities then which are altogether in thy power, sincerity, gravity, endurance of labour, aversion to pleasure, contentment with thy portion and with few things, benevolence, frankness, no love of superfluity, freedom from trifling, magnanimity. Dost thou not see how many qualities thou art immediately able to exhibit, in which there is no excuse of natural incapacity and unfitness, and yet thou still remainest voluntarily below the mark? or art thou compelled through being defectively furnished by nature to murmur, and to be stingy, and to flatter, and to find fault with thy poor body, and to try to please men, and to make great display, and to be so restless in thy mind? No by the gods: but thou mightest have been delivered from these things long ago. Only if in truth thou canst be charged with being rather slow and dull of comprehension, thou must exert thyself about this also, not neglecting it nor yet taking pleasure in thy dulness.”


It says that if we don’t have s desirable trait by nature alone that it’s in our power to gain it by dedication 

I want to be a kind and smart man, I’m kind by nature but not very smart (it’s obvious that a lot of factors come into play that Marcus Aurelius couldn’t have understood back then, such as in my case where I’m a neurodivergent person but that doesn’t mean that I can’t strive to learn more with a combination of meditation, therapy and discipline of study) 

The quote emphasises subjects of dedication, control of pleasure, acceptance of one’s luck (or the idea of fortuna), benevolence, etc 

It teaches us to not blame external factors and that the talent can be surpassed if the dedication overcomes the talent, as someone who have always compared myself with my peers and always thought that (i’m slow and there’s nothing that I can do to change it) this quote hit me like a brick to the head",Stoicism,1705261004.0,t3_196o3kq,0.9,14

Advice on Grief,"Hi everybody.

I found my Dad yesterday morning. He'd died suddenly in his home, alone. This hurts immensely to think about. 

Around 8 years ago I also found my mother dead. I thought I'd processed that, but I'm finding all those feelings are coming back up now. Maybe that's natural, I'm not sure. 

A couple of months back I had started to dabble in Stoicism as a concept. I've listened to Meditations and found it really insightful in reframing everyday life.

I saw a post here a short while ago about how Marcus Aurelius fed people to animals, and what that says about the credibility of his Meditations.  I don't know what the exact context was of my post title when he wrote it, but as I reflect on it, I am taking everything I have written here into consideration. 

Also, I try to praise loudly and criticize quietly, but I Still critize, blame people when I don't get what i want from them, especially if they've been reliable in the past. It's the inconsistency of people that gets to me alittle, because even though I am not perfect in my interactions with people, I prioritize being consistent(although it's out of my hands how people perceive my consistency.) So whenever i catch myself mentally blaming someone, I lean into it, but I ""level"" myself by adding to that mentally placating the person, or adding to that the mental equivalent of being physiologically distracted. Non of these is exactly in Stoicism(because non of those involves being super logical), but they are in a form of therapy I've found useful. And yes, I do know how important being logical about everything is, how useful logic is, and how indispensable it is to the life I am trying to live.

I always wanted to try the first one, but the duty that I can fail my family completely always has kept me at bay, it was didn't felt ""stoic"" to puruse just because of the passion, so I decided that I will cut off all my liesure time and give to both, 1st & 2nd career (hidden from fam)

Rather than commiting to one ""career"" choice, I have commited to a routine and detached myself from the results of either outcome, I always felt, trying to catch 2 rabbits, won't get me either, but not thinking about the result (which ain't in my control) and keeping my focus in the moment & the process will do me good. but anxiety hits me when my family asks me when is my career taking off. 

Since I always try not to never think about the milestone or result, and rather than focus on everyday, the thoughts of ""pursuing"" or even doing two things in a day, which would seem normal to anyone, takes a big toll on my reasonsing as to where am I headed? Am i being selfish not commiting to one thing that do my family good and excel in it. (doing my duty rather than running for small passions) or am I wrong to puruse a thing in the act of desiring it for my family (which evidently does affect my peace & can be attested 98% by the world, because they are or have been in the same boat) should I just perform my one duty without the care reaching my desire & focus on my sole virute ",Stoicism,1705158097.0,t3_195pumv,0.63,2
What is the view of depression in stoicism,"I was introduced to stoicism by this greek doctor that I worked with two years ago and suffice to say some of the principles had helped me through some dark times in my life. 

I am curious to see the perspective of a stoic in terms of depression. I constantly get a sudden attack of extreme sadness with or without trigger which manifests in physical tiredness (too tired to move even a little) 

I think the scary thing about depression is how real you think what lies/uncertainty/assumption/conclusion your mind tells you. 

Like many others struggling the same, I get tired too, tried many things but to no avail. 

I have accepted that there is no guarantee that I will get better and vice versa. 

Do I just accept that my life is surrounded by mostly sadness?  And how do I achieve that?",Stoicism,1705157618.0,t3_195poga,0.5,0
I dont know how to stop chasing and still make friends... i want to stop being desperate and needy stop people pleasing and stop chasing.,"This thought is back again... i see some guy texting and smiling and making her happy and i think ""i cant do that"" i cant talk for hours and its always me chasing and starting conversations then i think that no girl likes me, then the thought of no one loves me or cares about me. And no one is into me, its like that thought disgusts them... i dont even want a Gf, just be friends with girls because i have none. 

I dont do this anymore but i used to text a girl and try to prove to my self that im not unlikeable or loveable and always would backfire.

And i dont even know what to talk about, be interested in her? I become interested but they arent interested, because i always text first, I dont know how to have conversations for a long time... or talk about everything, i suck at talking

[DISCUSSION] Investigating Anger is the answer,"Good morning Stoa, a few days ago I came here after I had an *incident*. I got angry and lost my temper.

It was very uncool of me, and that lead to a lot of introspection, analysis, reflections, writing, and research.  

Not only I have come to the realization that I was wrong, but that I have been wrong all my life.

I had the wrong belief systems and worldviews, which rendered my analysis of the situations faulty.

Regardless that I was wronged, I had no business at getting angry, let alone losing my temper. That is never the answer to anything. I had faulty belief systems.

I have reframed my thinking and my belief systems, thanks in partly to Stoicism.

Today I am a better man, I still have work to do to better myself, and I know that the episode was a tilting point in my life.

I thank this sub for providing me with great comments and continuing to provide a source of sanity.

Feeling the weight of time: Struggling to find my path in mid20s,"




I didn't work the entire 2023 year and I don't even have any health insurance. The only thing I did was trying to complete classes for college. But I even missed two semesters because of personal problems and stuff. I'm also feeling lost in life despite being in mid-20s. I just can't seem to find my path in life like career wise. I feel like I'm too old for college especially going in university because it seems like time consuming and finically expensive. I'm currently in community college and they do offer various certification programs and even two year degree programs but I'm not not sure what to get into as Im worrying like stuff about Ai expanding then bunch of layoffs happened. I want to get in a career that will help in long run and be substantial. I'm just stuck in this rut for about a year and even this new year hasn't been to a great start. I just can't afford myself sitting at home doing nothing. I'm just allowing my mind and thoughts control me. I'm tired of this anxiety and fear. Not having understand of life makes me feel weak and overwhelmed. I'm lacking confidence I guess and I'm just trying to find my way out. I previously so far only have fast food and retail experience but because I'm not driving, I'm kinda in a tight spot like transportation is issue in my area so I even applied to remote jobs but obviously I have hard time finding too sighs. So I'm just in completely messed up spot in life right now. Don't understand what to pick and choose or what to do first or something.

How Do I transcend My Own Suffering?,"I recently started reading a psychiatry book, titled The Haunted Self, which is primarily focus on trauma diagnosis and recovery. I learned that trauma can shatter your very essence in a proportional amount to the severity and frequency of the trauma. Don't get me wrong I understand that suffering is a fact of life, and therefore, cannot be avoided. Additionally, suffering can teach us valuable lessons and propel us forward if harnessed and put to good use. Nevertheless, I still can't wrap my head around the fact that there are no lessons to learn from, for instance, having a family full of psychopaths, murderers, rapists and pedophiles. From the stoic point of view, how am I supposed to transcend pain when it was inflicted for sadistic pleasure repeatedly for a decade of my so-called childhood? How can I transcend the pain of never knowing what mother love is? How can I transcend the pain of losing everyone I care about?

I like the notion in Stoicism that moral virtue should be at the top of everyone's priorities. In fact, I lost everything and nearly lost my life because virtue matters the most to me, and if I get a re-do I won't change a thing. I guess my problem is that I don't understand how to resolve 'pointless pain' that offers no lessons, but still haunts me to this day.

"""What should be done?"" My thoughts on this","Since I was little I've always been very inspired by history, and I've always wanted to 'make a difference', I guess is a good way of putting it. In short, I wanted to no longer be an NPC in the world, and today I see that things are a little more complicated, I think today I understand that this is something that we all try to do, and that perhaps this is what makes us part of the whole , we all want to be different and that's something that makes us equal, I think. Anyway, I always had this desire to find something that would make me do something for the world, not caring about fame or anything like that, but just to know that I contributed a little to the future of humanity, something like Newton's contributions to Physics, a subject that I have always loved. A little because of this, I decided to start a physics course at university, with the childhood dream that it would be easy to achieve something of this magnitude, but then I was faced with the fact that maybe I didn't like physics that much to dedicate myself to it. an entire life. I mean, the more time passes, the more I realize that I'm not an academic. I love physics, but I also love many other things that take up my time and that I consider just as important. It's as if the side of me that wants to do something for the world conflicts with the side of me that just seeks my happiness. On the one hand, I fear spending my whole life searching in vain, and in the end realizing that I wasted my chances of enjoying everything I could. And on the other side, I fear reaching the end of my life, taking advantage of every opportunity to be happy, but having to carry the burden of feeling like I haven't achieved anything, of not having left anything useful behind, as if my existence as a human asked me to do something. Currently the answer I have to this dilemma is that, no one who really changed the world had the objective of 'changing the world', they had an insatiable passion for something, and leaving a legacy of that was just a consequence of that passion. It's like an eternal doubt, I want to fulfill a duty and not be selfish, at the same time that I can't say there is something, a passion, that makes me focus on it that much, because I love many things.

&#x200B;

Forgive me for this huge text hehe. I know I'm still young and immature, so forgive me too if I wrote something clearly absurd (Also if this has nothing to do with stoicism, I'm still new), but that's how I feel. These existential questions have always plagued me, but I like to think, I like to think about them and any work that delves into this type of thing. A work that I can use to draw a parallel about how I feel is the work of fiction and fantasy Fate Stay Night, more specifically the character Emiya Shirou. In short, and spoilers ahead, the game has 3 routes in which Shirou makes different decisions. In one of them, he decides to become a hero of justice, even though he knows all the bitterness that this path would bring, and the story really deals with that, it is a complete break with that hero stereotype, but Shirou still chooses to be, which I think it's very pretty. In another route, however, he decides to be the hero of just one person, Sakura, the girl he loves. In one route he decides to embrace his childish ideals in the name of a greater good, and in another he decides to embrace his own happiness. In both cases he decides to embrace this passion, and I feel exactly in the middle of it, remembering that it is just a parallel. Trying to be a 'normal' person or trying to be something more. I see possible regrets in both of them. I know there's no right answer, but I think I wanted to vent a little about this, and I wanted to know if you guys had any thoughts on this. It's something that scares me a little hehe, but I like to think about it",Stoicism,1705115413.0,t3_195dz3r,0.43,0
Basic knowledge of philosophy,"Morning/Evening all depending on where you are in the world. 

I’m new to stoicism and so far am very much enjoying trying to apply its teaching to my life. However I have no real understanding of philosophy in general and feel as though some of the OG stoic material is lost of me because of this. 

Do I need to first explore philosophical concepts such as ‘metaphysics', ‘nature’ and all that before I can truly understand the words of Epictetus and Marcus?

How should you actually read Meditations?,"So long story short...I've been an admirer and reader of the Stoics, particularly Marcus Aurelius, for years. What I'm trying to do is to practice the virtues sufficiently that they become habit and second-nature to me - something that probably will take years if not decades to accomplish. It's a really difficult task and I've messed up (pretty badly) on multiple occasions.

And so I often ask myself the question ""How did \[insert Stoic\] do it?"" At least for Marcus Aurelius it seems part of the answer was keeping himself accountable with his personal journal - what we read as Meditations today. And Meditations is a beautiful book, just...I've found it really hard to read. The problem might be the version, I'm using the Hicks version, but it's always seemed like a collection impossibly difficult maxims that I could appreciate in a moment of serenity but not in a moment of crisis.

Is the problem the version I'm using? Am I studying Meditations wrong? Is it just my fault for being slow-witted? Any advice would be much appreciated.

Struggling to connect with others - feel like I am repeating the same thing over and over again.,"Life seems to be a constant struggle. I feel like I am running around in circles, infinitely so. 

I have struggled with depression for a long time (and I also have Aspergers). My depression is kind of situational. If I have friends, work and things to do, it doesn’t emerge. But when I don’t, life doesn’t feel worth living. I take mediciation for it (and therapy) which has helped immensely, but I can’t help but think that I seem to be stuck in this cycle that I cannot seem to break out of. 

My depression led to me dropping out of high school. Despite this, I worked my ass off at home and made it to one of the best colleges in the country.

While I find it easy to make 1:1 connections with others,  I never seem to connect with groups or make a solid circle of friends. The 1:1 friendships I have are often really intense but for one reason or another they die out. And for really inexplicable reasons. Sometimes they will go back home, then when college starts they suddenly don’t want to talk much or hang out anymore. I don’t get it.

I graduated college with great academics but not much to show for it in the way of friendships. For career reasons, I decided to do a masters program at again one of the best colleges. But I seem to be struggling with the same problem. I can have great conversations with a lot of people. But I don’t have a group. And sometimes I’ll arrange things with people, but people have yet to invite me to anything, except for birthday parties. I want to be hanging out with people, going out, having a good time. Yet I seem to be alone on Friday night, again, while everyone else is doing exactly that. 

I can’t seem to break this cycle I seem to be stuck in. I think my Aspergers may be a part of why I can’t connect in the same way that others do, but I can’t seem to figure out what I’m doing wrong, even with therapy. I don’t know how much more of this I can take.",Stoicism,1705092228.0,t3_19559zv,0.5,0

Help,"I got into stoicism last year after reading a book called: the little book of stoicism. It was quite helpful, but nonetheless 2023 was the hardest year of my life, I suffered severed anxiety and struggled a lot. The main reason being that I struggled to separate what was outside of my control. I tried journalling every day, meditating and therapy. It did not help, but I am going to keep trying as know it can be a powerful tool. 

Does anybody know what steps I can take to make stoicism a bigger part of my life in 2024, whether that be books, or daily exercises I can do to slowly build up this muscle, as I have always suffered for things that were not up to me, and I need to stop it. I want to improve myself and get better as it often times causes me unnecessary distress and pain. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated!

How do you let go of the past trauma? (Bullying),"I (27m) was pushed around a lot in High School, emotionally and physically. This went into freshman year too. As I was outnumbered, this made me an easy target.

What do you do when you feel like life has no meaning and you’re an outsider ?,"
Yeah it’s gonna be a depressive one

I’m 24 years old, neurodivergent, queer (and last year found out that I’m trans, something that my bigoted parents are surely going to love), I have been battling depression for more than 10 years, have binge eating disorder, social anxiety and generally feel like an outsider and that I’m wasting my life 

I live in Brazil and everything here is so loud and confusing and every day I need to deal with a bunch of Ignorant people 

I’m just tired, I’m almost a quarter of a century old and I’ve wasted my life up to this point,  I have no personal achievements, no driving license (I failed the exam), no romantic relationship (although I don’t really care about that just think that it would be nice), no discipline and don’t know how to have it 

Im going to finish college this year and I didn’t even picked what I wanted to graduate, my mom chose that I was gonna be a dentist behind my back without consulting me, and I really don’t want to be a dentist 

I’ve had my ups and downs during those years but they were mostly bad, I’ve cried for no reason during most of my days, have contemplated suicide in a lot of occasions and I’m generally just screaming in my mind “I WANT TO DIE WHAT AM I DOING HERE ?!?!” while looking calm on the outside

"How Stoicism Helped Me Throughout the Years, Despite Key Misunderstandings","*I hope this little tale can serve as inspiration for those of you interested in Stoicism only as a shield and less so as a toolbox. A*s it turned out for me, it provided and even more powerful operating system.

&#x200B;

I first stumbled upon Stoicism in 2012 as a graduate. I read ""Letters from a Stoic"" as I imagine newly converted Christians read the Bible; quite literally and with great joy and fulfillment.

At the time, I was a young man who had listened to everything from Dan Pena, Joe Dispenza, and to some extent Tony Robbins, even though he always seemed too ""guru-ish"" for me to really believe in. Stoicism provided me with the operating system I needed at the time.

However, I mistook being stoic for not letting emotions get to me. This served me very well for years. I overcame one challenge after another, climbed the corporate ladder quickly, and moved all over Europe in search of additional personal and professional growth. By many metrics, I was a young successful man with everything ahead of me.

One day, I realized my current job and life situation were no longer challenging. Despite making good money, living in a safe and affluent city, and earning a decent amount while traveling often, I was bored. I needed action. So, I took the leap, leaving that job for another and moving once again to a different city in Europe.

It was shortly after making the decision to move again that I realized much of my boredom and lack of growth where I was actually had very little to do with my surroundings, and everything to do with myself. By, in a Stoic manner, turning off most of my emotions, both the highs and lows of my intense life felt bland.

Shortly after, I returned to Stoicism and this forum. I realized that Stoicism is really about accepting feelings and then ""applying"" Stoicism, instead of using it as a mental filter to mute feelings and numb sensations. At one point, I was afraid that this new approach would make me lose one of my strongest abilities in life: to endure hardship.

But, as it turns out, this new way of interpreting Stoicism, for me, provided an even more powerful operating system to tackle everyday life. I learned how to accept feelings, embrace them, and power through. The acceptance step became crucial, as it helped me feel pain, enabling fruitful reflection and therefore progress.

I hope this little tale can serve as inspiration for those of you interested in Stoicism only as a shield and less so as a toolbox. If possible, try to repeat my misstake :)",Stoicism,1704895967.0,t3_19396dw,0.87,11

Help with list of Stoic quotes,"One of the things I lament about so-called ""Stoic quotes"" online is that they rarely, if ever, include the source. As I find myself presently in the midst of a project that requires me to gather roughly 50 brief Stoic quotes, the process of falsifying them as having actually come from who they say they come from is proving quite tedious. 

Many of them are poorly paraphrased so it could take me an hour or two to find out where they came from and, by the time I do, they might not even carry the same meaning as the malformed quote did. 

If you have the time and inclination, dropping one or two of your favorite quotes (with sources) in this thread would be helpful... if not to me specifically, as I might not find your quote specifically applicable to what I'm working on, to anyone looking for a trustworthy repository of Stoic quotes with sources!

The Jean Valjean problem. Does stoicism indeed say he should not steal bread?,"Wanted to raise this question after listening to a discussion on a podcast. I am having some issues with it, so I'm coining the phrase the Jean Valjean problem  


In Les Miserables, Jean Valjean steals bread and is cast into prison for it. He eventually escapes and becomes a better person. 


The problem for stoicism as I understand it is the theft part. I may not understand stoicism correctly here,  but I believe that since stoics state virtue is the highest goal, and that our own life is less important than this, stealing a loaf of bread to survive (assuming for the sake of argument it is a life and death situation,  no escaping the thought experiment by claiming another option like borrowing money to buy bread) is considered less virtuous than not stealing and succumbing to death. 


I am not sure if this is a correct interpretation,  but I cannot agree with it for 2 eeasons:


1) Life isn't worthless. The value of continuing life at the expense of stolen bread is worth it. The value of a life is more than a loaf of bread so even though theft is not virtuous, it is excusable in this situation. 


2) life is worthwhile specifically because permitting a life to continue,  even at the expense of virtue, means that the person can grow and become virtuous over time. They cannot do that if they are dead.

Seeking comfort after dog’s loss,"My childhood dog, best friend and only company has passed away after fighting tumours for last 4 months. I am 22. Yesterday was supposed to be a regular veterinary visit and schedule to remove one tumour. He was 12, turned it just 1 month ago and was a golden retriever. He had multiple tumours which were operated and taken out, but one kept coming for the third time. It was his 4th operation in 4 months. Last days he was not eating and drinking that much as his tumour was in his mouth and was bleeding and hurting him. He went to the car so happy, full of life. I knew that it would take him but not that quick. Vet took him to immediate operation as his tumour started bleeding heavily, and we were told to pick him up in few hours. Upon arriving, the vet said he removed it and that he is slowly waking up but still bleeding so he advises to leave him overnight. At 9PM we got a call that he passed away after failed reanimation. My world broke.

We didn’t properly said goodbye. I can’t believe that the last picture of him is from yesterday shortly before leaving. My family is broken too. What hurts me is that he died without us, after promising him that we will pick him up as usual. Last night was tough, barely slept at all. I am on and off from stoicism in last year, but I know core concepts and it helped me a little. We are to bury him tomorrow as we have to pick him up today.

how do I attain happiness in my routine and life?," I've recently reflected on what had brought me joy in the past, the current moment and also could in the future. This is a copy of my thoughts, and I'd love to hear other people's thoghts on it :)

so, how do I attain happiness in my daily routine and life? 

Everyone want to be happy, and there are different ways for people to achieve that, each person has their own way that they persue. Taking my mates for example, at least what I see on the outside, they occasionally go out to parties, get high and drink, eat junk food and those are usually their highlights of the day. 

But that's not what I truely enjoy doing. Literally today, had my first pizza in probably three years, and it was seriously pretty bad. The taste was actually aweful. I felt nauseous afterwards, and regardless if I had a group involvement in my class I would prefer to pick a different, more nutricous meal for lunchtime. Thinking back to when I had a streak of a couple of days of being active, excercising and eating enough nutricous food, I literally get a sense of freedom, acomplishment and expecially peace.  

This was one of the things that brings me back to my question: How do I find happiness and purpose? Since it doesn't seem like a reasonable option to have a completely concrete step-by-step plan to be happy, since things change and you need to adapt, but I am aware many perspectives, healthy and unhealthy, picking the option for delayed or instant gradification, and in the long run it's always better to opt for the delayed, healthy option. Just recently I've watched a video, it's blantly obvious but the things that you are doing now are not effecting you right now, but rather the things you did years, months, days prior do. And in reverse your future depends on what you literally do at the current moment.  

So how do I attain happiness in my routine and in life?  

I need to find a balance between work and life.  

Currently I need to get education going and persue the path of excellence in academics. Afterwards I will be able to have a job that is high paying, so I can do whatever I want, not be constrained by a lack of rescources. Of course not to forget that for long term happiness it's highly important to pick a job that you actually enjoy doing, possibly using the method of ikagai, and also considering your established type of intelligence that you were born with (reference from a podcast that robert freene was on and mentioned that matter in his book mastery, the types are: linguistic, logical-mathematical, inter/-arpersonal, naturalistic, musical, kinesthetic and spacial intelligence; source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/harvard-psychologist-types-of-intelligence-where-do-you-score-highest-in.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/harvard-psychologist-types-of-intelligence-where-do-you-score-highest-in.html) ) Additionally, reflecting on the chliche suggestion that you should be enjoying your teen years while you can (go out and party, get drunk, high, not care about what you fuel your body with, when you sleep, etc.) I personally don't consider that view of ""enjoying your young teens"" as true enjoyment.  

In the moment in which I reach the top of a mountain after a high hike, having delicous dinner after a long day, waking up for a tasty breakfast, the morning sky, the sunset, the sun rise, the colors that the sky can take during different hours of the day, the way clouds move though out atmosphere, the acomplishment when you start comprehending an interesting topic, having deeptalk with a friend, the butterflies that you suddenly get when seeing a certain someonehaving music literally run through your veins when inducing it or just listening; the flow when reading an incaptivating book, the adrenaline kick when doing some crazy activity, sights of cities, landmarks, nature, different cultures, architecture, languages, customs, fashion or just calm walks acompanied by your close ones or just just yourself; there are endless opportunities that are here to be discovered, literally endless.  

Drifting back to reality, above I've listed multiple examples of things, that some far have brought sincere joy to my life and contributed to my life's purpose. Ejoying existing while growing for the betterment of myself and humanity. Obviously those moments cannot, at the time that I'm writing this down, happen on a daily basis. Right now I am given the opportunity, all ressources necessary, to educate myself, get a job and open the door for many more occassions which will bring me joy. 

It's absolutely obligatory for me not to let into brainfog, to start neglecting my health and being able to enjoy the simplicity and beauty of raw nature due to my dopanime receptors (and just my physical and mental condition) be fried to the brim of exctintion. Not let myself forget the hidden dangers of instant gradification and get in a hellish loop that day by day would bring me closer to depression, anxiety, shame and even death.  

So how do I balance my work and free time in a sustainable, meaningful way? 

It is of significance to consider that laying out an unrealistic schedule of a self-improvement type of guru is not going to be beneficial because of multiple reasons. The motive of it isn't really wrong, but the execution is usually not backed by scientific proof, and a sense of purpose. Why do so many people fail their new years resulution? Quiet frankly, they are not thinking about both long and short term dradification. There needs to be a balanced amount of both, else (at least that's what it's been like for me) it's not maintainable. It's so simple to skip going to the gym and  just have that last junky snack, because it's so much easier to do so. Instead just show up to the gym, don't obligate yourself to do a full on three hour workout, seriously just show up and do the bare minimun. Only thrity minutes is totally enough. If you've done, and keep picking this option consistenly, then you can do whatever would please you afterwards. Usually when you've already brought yourself to start, show up for that half an hour, is what it needs to get the stone rolling for a more productive way of living. You will get endorphines by doing the sport, a happy hormone, and the meal after excersising always tastes better if youre slightly worn out.  

And if you consistenly repeat an effective, maintainable routine, you will eventually reach a point where you can do whatever, whenever, with the people you love. That doesn't mean you can't do those things in the process of getting there, it is of most significace that you incooperate enough healthy happiness boosting activities into your routine in order to be able to sustain the discipline. Because in words it's easier written than done, actually do the due paper, decline unhealthy habits, but it can be done. You need to reward youself with ""natural"" induced gradification (note: look these methods up, backed up science based evidence), self reflection, self awareness and a sense of purpose.  

It's impossible to summarrise how to have a sense of purpose briefly, but the main point is that every person has their own, evolving purpose/reason to live for. Since the world is evoling and so many things are out of my control, I rather focus on the things that are in my power, like picking to go on a peaceful walk, enjoy a couple minutes of chilling with my loving cat, etc, that give me some direction of purpose. Do things that are genuinly meaningful to me.  ",Stoicism,1704761683.0,t3_1921ix9,0.87,6

I am going through incredible pressure from my surroundings and the feeling of being stabbed in the back.," 

About a year ago, I started a project with a few friends at that time. We were just a branch of a larger project that someone initiated in the capital city. The completion of that project was supposed to bring benefits to all of us. Hoping for a positive outcome, I handed over complete control to my friend at that time. We went through a tough period together, working hard and under a lot of stress. I lost 5kg due to anxiety, and it also cost me a lot of money. The project was completed a few months ago. The people in charge in the capital city are now working and reaping the benefits. I waited for them to call me and offer something, a job or a way to earn money, because we went through all of that together. However, they never contacted me. Now I find out that all this time, they were communicating with my friend who was the coordinator for my area, but he pushed me aside and is collecting benefits for his closest circle of people and family. I am practically excluded from the story even though I did everything that everyone else did, even more. My family and friends ask me every day when something will come out of it, when I can expect something. Some people even have expectations that I can help them, even though I can't help myself. It's very difficult to be deceived and betrayed, especially in a small town. I don't know what to do; I don't have contact with people from the capital city. Also, I wouldn't want to confront my 'friend' because maybe something will come from him. Please advise me because I can't sleep at night, and I can't bear to see my sad parents because I was deceived in some way.""

Finding gratitude can be so difficult,"Gratitude can be so hard to find for my personality type. I’m a perfectionist, idealist, and can be vain and superficial.

It can be really easy for me to focus on the negative. Get angry/pitiful at myself, life, fate. And easy to look around me and wonder why I have to deal with issues that all these others don’t (of course they’re likely dealing with their own problems).

I’ve been quite depressed before and still struggle with bouts of anxiety, sadness. Objectively speaking, I’ve been blessed in many ways. But I think it’s easy to take things for granted.

I had to struggle with anxiety for a long time also anxiety of dying so thats not new to me. I take sleep to seriously and cant fall asleep because i stress myself about sleeping.

Is there a contradiction between stoicism and modern psychology about control of emotions ?,"If I understand well, to simplify stoicism tells us to control emotions
And psychology today tells us to listen and welcome our emotion.",Stoicism,1704737906.0,t3_191rtvp,0.36,0
"The Jedi code sounds like it was written by a stoic, and the Sith code a hedonist.","*There is no emotion, there is peace*.  

*There is no ignorance, there is knowledge.*  

*There is no passion, there is serenity.*  

*There is no chaos, there is harmony.*  

*There is no death, there is the Force.*  

The first line I’m not sure I completely agree with. There are things like rational joy, but in a broader sense I think stoics would at least agree in part. Emotions are contrived from our judgments, which are a construct. Inner peace though is a common stoic theme, and is the result of sound judgment, not false beliefs assented into emotion.

The second line reminds me of a theme in stoicism that the true stoic sage is never upset, because he only has knowledge. Socrates famously said “the only sin is ignorance”.  

The third line is another stoic tenant. Marcus Aurelius talks in the meditations often about avoiding passions as they can take away from your rationality and sound judgment. A good sound judgment and an understanding of nature, will result in a natural sense of serenity and joy.  

The fourth line is again, often brought up in stoicism. I interpret chaos here as “unnatural”. Everything is natural, therefore nothing can be unnatural or chaotic. Chaos is a perception. A vicious storm isn’t chaotic, it’s just a storm. A result of nature that brings harmony and balance.  

And finally the last line. I’m not precisely sure what metaphor is meant by *there is no death*, as there is of course death. Maybe they meant you ought not to fear death. Maybe they meant you never really die because you’re resorbed back into the force. And the force could be interpreted in stoic physics as *the logos* as the ancient philosophers say.  

With all that dissected here is the sith code by contrast. You can make your own interpretations, but I think it’s clear why this doctrine is adopted by “the baddies” in the Star Wars universe. It clearly leads to a troubled, never satisfied, self destructive, vice consuming soul.  

*Peace is a lie. There is only Passion.*  

*Through Passion, I gain Strength.*  

*Through Strength, I gain Power.*  

*Through Power, I gain Victory.*  

*Through Victory my chains are Broken.*  

*The Force shall free me.*  

I’ve seen people unironically get the sith code tattooed on themselves. It sounds hype on surface level but upon further inspection, it’s troubling.",Stoicism,1704651506.0,t3_190yh7d,0.78,22
For new Stoics...,"With the popularity of Stoicism, like from Ryan Holiday and Massimo Pigliucci. People new to Stoicism should learn that they are referred to as Modern Stoics, which is a secular part of Traditional Stoicism. They leave out the most important part of Traditional Stoicism, Providence, and living according to Nature. If you read Marcus, Seneca, and Epictetus, Nature is foundational and is the only way Stoicism truly works to reach eudaimonia or happiness. If you are serious about Stoicism, learn how the Stoics viewed everything from a cosmic standpoint. Without it's not true Tradition Stoicism as the ancients taught, it's a secular form.

Of course, I replied ""I agree 100%"", but it made me think of Stoicism and this sub.

What is the *""Stoic""* answer?

We know that the world runs mostly on emotionally-driven decisions, we see it every day; so is it *silly* to wish otherwise? Should we as Stoics be like Ninjas, not wishing that the world were different, but improvise, adapt, and overcome life's situations as they manifest themselves to us?

How to stop desiring women,"Im a single 31 yr old man, my whole life ive felt alone, sad, and sometimes depressed. My parents were verbally abusive to each other before they seperated after 25 yrs.

I even went to south east asia, and paid for escorts just to not feel lonely, to feel like i have someone who pretends to like me for 1 hr, honestly that was a mistake.

How to reconcile Aurelius's murder of Christians with his Stoicism,"So I was telling someone the other day how much I loved Marcus Aurelius, and how much his ""Meditations"" meant to me, and what a cool philosopher he was, et al, and she said ""I used to love him, too.

I'll be honest, I had no idea about this, so I googled it, and she was more or less exactly correct. Now, I understand that the times were the times, and Roman Emperors were not pacifists, and that Christians were seen as sort of a crazy fringe cult at the time.

"On Virtue, Asceticism and the Request for Help","Hi everyone

I would like to ask you what exercises you need to do in order to grow in virtue. I read Marcus Aurelius several times, but I abandoned it in favor of the diatribes and the encheiridiona of Epictetus. I also read Cicero, whom I like very much because of his understanding of virtue.

1 Specific question: what do you think about asceticism as a preferential good that purifies all vices from man? Such as laziness, lack of self-discipline, and so on. Of course, this serves as a preliminary stage, for it is known that the man who tilles the soil, has uprooted the weeds, cut the earth, and sows or plants, that is, develops virtues. That's not to say that he hasn't done it before, but that getting rid of the superfluous helps. What do you think? (P.S. I'm a fan of Cynic asceticism)

2  Can virtue be exercised and will it always be present until we neglect it? I'm afraid that virtue is only an exercise of judgments in the mind that we hold onto, and that when they are lacking, it turns out that there is no virtue and never has been? After all, if it turns out that Stoic virtue is just a matter of the mind, I think I'd rather have Cicero's teaching on virtue than the Greek masters.

3  Do you have any internships that you can recommend to me? The reason I'm asking you this is that I'd rather deal with practices than just theoretical scripts on a lot of websites. I believe I can learn a lot from you, so if you would like to share some advice with me, I will be happy to hear it.

Please be patient and understanding, I'm not even sure if I gave the right flair (I'm sorry if I chose the wrong one). I try to learn new things and analyze what I already know, whether what I knew was really right.

Best regards!

Hi Stoics! Lend me your ear a moment please!,"Hey guys. I feel the desire to be very detailed here but I’ll try to keep it short and hopefully not break any rules while I’m at it.

I am 40 years old and I’m about 3 years outside of deconstructing from a lifelong Baptist brainwa… I mean, faith. I had always butted heads with fellow Christians, I always felt like it was all pretty fake and vain, and I was one of those delirious young Christians who thought I had a special connection with God, a certain special empathy for other human beings or something.

Anyways, when I was 35, my left foot started going numb and I figured it was just a pinched nerve in my back. Fast forward 3 years and now the numbness spread to my whole body, and even neurologists at Cleveland Clinic can’t figure it out, and say it has to be something genetic. (This is where I could really ramble, so I’ll stop myself here).

This was the straw that broke the Camel’s back, this is what finally pushed me through deconstruction and take that terrifying leap of ironic faith. I read a few books like Leaving the Fold, Age of Reason, etc. A lot of books on buddhism were also helpful in learning to meditate, but I felt like it was flirting too much with religion.

Then I read Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations, and that was it. Lights out, this dude spoke the language of my very soul. I’m happy to have found Stoicism! My biggest problem is that I am still so very hung up on my anger and resentment towards Yahweh, its so bad that it colors almost all of my thoughts. I still feel like a dictator is lording over everything. I still mentally lash out at him in my darkest times, even though I know I’m screaming at the void.

So, long story short, how do I kick this Jesus habit? Thanks for reading and sorry if I offended anyone. That snarky, passive aggressiveness towards Christianity is THE very thing I’m trying to address.

Edit: I know I could and should post this over in the ex-christian sub, and I’m definitely a lurker over there, but it can be a bit of an echo-chamber in there.",Stoicism,1704557978.0,t3_1903h7a,0.75,6

I am one of the r/niceguys. How do I undo this?,"OK, maybe not really like /r/niceguys, I am happily married, and when I was single I had no problems dating, although casually dating, FWB, ONS.

My ""problems"" manifest mostly at work, friendships and family members.

-----

I am not new to Stoicism, I have read the classics and Pigliucci/Irvine; and I know that Stoicism is not about suppressing one's emotions.

I am posting here because the mods allow *""Seeking Stoic Advice""* posts, and because the comments here are the best quality comments across the entire Reddit ecosystem.

I am an old(er) Redditor and I have come a long way in my life; up until not long ago I thought that my life was pretty great, then the other day I lost my temper, something that had not happened in a very long time, and that I thought it was gone from my personality; but there I was. And it was ugly. I was ugly. Details withheld because they don't matter. Losing one's temper is uncalled for. Period.

But my reflections on what happens has led me to keen observation of my MO(s) and behavior, and I have come to the realization that:

1. I don't perform well in confrontations
2. I don't perform well under stress (stress real or imagined)
3. I play ""nice"" by default, but then turn ugly in situations #1 and #2 above.
4. So really, I am not that ""nice"".

I have read ""No More Mr Nice Guy"", as well as ""Not Nice"" and ""The Disease to Please"".

Dear members of this Stoa, if you are still with me, besides my Stoic practice of reading and re-reading the classics and selective modern Stoic writers (I don't do Ryan H), daily journaling, daily journaling challenging my belief systems, what resources do you have for me to better myself?

I am also looking into my insurance benefits for going to therapy too. I have been in therapy in the past for depression and then declared depression-free (and I believe it).  I know I have some problems with anxiety and, of course, anger; but I do believe that anxiety and anger are related.

Grieving for the lost health,"I've had flu-like symptoms for six months. All kinds of physical effort, like walking or standing, feel horrible. This has led me to grieve for my health. I know every single human loses their health eventually. I had plans. I know everyone will have plans that will be cancelled permanently. What difference does it make if it happens now or in 40 years? If you have seen a day, you have seen them all. And I have experienced life already.
Some things have been harder than before for me lately, but what difference does hard or easy make? Why would an easy life be more valuable for me?
Truth is, I have no way of knowing how long all this will last for me. An even firmer truth is that this is all just the beginning. Losing health, among other things, is inevitable. Not just for me but for all. Why lament the natural state of life?

How to manage stress in gaming (and in general)?,"I'm a young man getting slowly into stoicism. It is like 4th day since i started reading about it more (I'm still in the middle of reading one of William B. Irvine's books, it's my first). I like playin a lot of dynamic, stressful games like e.g. ULTRAKILL. I think im playing rationally - trying some tactics, doing stuff to manage problems (prioritizing enemies, defending yourself etc.). Nontheless tend to feel a lot of stress. At first i was still raging, hitting my desk, but today i felt a bit of a progress - i was still very stressed, i sometimes felt angry, however i remained calm and ""took a deep breath"" and went ahead. It might be also be caused by the fact i'm at my grandma and i don't want to make noise.
This applies to even some activities. In fact, i feel stress rn writing this (dunno why exactly tho). After trying to imply Irvine's suggestions in my daily life i feel better - i usually felt like people want the worst for me and they treat me as someome worse. Nowadays i feel less affected, like i don't care. Only time i felt bad was when my friend called PlayStation 3 gay (yes, he has xbox lmao) as i have huge nostalgia for this console.
What i want to ask in summary - is there a way to calm myself down after a big dose of stress and is it bad for me, as a stoic, to feel stressed in gaming?",Stoicism,1704558937.0,t3_1903u81,0.55,1
Is this correct?,"So i have started studying stoicism and its been two months, and i have been journaling about a month of the thoughts am having daily and the judgements i pass onto things i try to examine those.

I won't go into much details and make this really long. Here's a brief context of the stuff that happened. Well i do corporate job and everyday we have requests which gets assigned to our team and whoever available senior will assign it to the resource who is available on that day. The problem is things get suddenly escalated to higher management and we need to complete those tasks ASAP.

What has happened one of the senior on my team assigned the request/task to me while i was on my week off. I got angry as to why she assigned the task but i did not confronted her because i was angry i just took the action just to remind her not to assign to someone who is in week off.

And i journaled the whole thing.

and it goes something like this.

Anger  
\------------------

An emotion which happens. When thare is Something unjust has happened.

Did that thing did unjust to me?

Well it was unjust. But let's not get into conclusion.

Let's think it this way.

Is assigning tasks is Something People Shouldn't do?Y  
es they should.

If they Should do then whom they should assign?  
The People who are available.

Now did she assign to Someone who was available on that day?  
NO .

I mean you do not serve food to a Person , who is not there to eat.

Then we know that you should assign the task to Someone who is available .

NOW

Is assigning task to Someone who is not available is an unjust act?

Its not an unjust act as she doesn't have knowledge as to who was available and who was not.

Hence anger should not have come there but we did not assent to that and did not made an impulsive act.

When is it okay to give unsolicited advice?,"Hello,

&#x200B;

I tried looking for a similar thread but found only posts talking about receiving unsolicited advice rather than giving it. So, I apologize if I'm retreading ground here.

&#x200B;

Basically though, I find my relationships with my friends suffer because I give off an aloof disposition (not on purpose). Many times my friends will bring up a problem they are having and I'm usually quiet. This is because I am worried about unsolicited advice or otherwise overstepping boundaries.

&#x200B;

I know it's quite okay to voice my opinion when explicitly asked, but find it harder to do so when my friends only imply they'd like advice. And often, I'm not even sure if that IS what they're implying.

&#x200B;

Because of this I think finding a deeper connection is sometimes difficult. Maybe I give off the vibe that I don't care, or perhaps it seems I am trying to change the subject outright.

&#x200B;

I also feel like I am denying my friends the decision as well. And I'm denying them a deeper insight into who I am that kind of prevents them from being comfortable around me. Maybe it seems like I'm hiding something or am coming off judgemental/stern.

&#x200B;

Well, what do you guys think? Am I caring too much what my friends think of me when I'm silent/reserved? Or do I just need to care more about authenticity? And when is proactively giving unsolicited advice acceptable?

&#x200B;

Would love to hear your thoughts on this. Thanks for your time and hope you're all well.

Afraid of how my family would react to my lack of beliefs,"Yeah that's basicallly it. In a nutshell, i was raised by a loving christian family and ended up becoming an atheist a year ago, without them knowing it. 
I love my family more than anything, and they help me a lot, my brother is like a father to me as he taught me a lot of the values i have today, in which some correlate to that of Stoicism.
But the problem is, i stopped believing in God. I am not seeking for religious advice or anything, because it just doesn't make sense to me in believing in a religion again, what i am struggling with is how to deal with it when it comes to my family. I know they would get sad and maybe even exclude me for it... I feel helpless because as far as i am concerned i am the only one in my family that doesn't believe in the religion and that makes me feel lonely and unmotivated.
Not only that, but oftentimes i feel like i am being too selfish, in the sense of ""They did everything to me and now you just leave everything"", specially towards my mom who struggled a lot to raise me.
Its been weeks i am dealing with this, and this questioning in my head is destroying me, i just can't work properly anymore with all of this.
I would like to know how me, as a someone who considers myself a stoic should deal with this, i even considered returning to the faith but i did that twice before and i relapsed back to atheism and i am afraid it could happen again

I started keeping a journal of the worst things that happen to me every day.,"About a week ago, I started keeping a little journal on my notes app of the worst things that happened to me each day.


It has helped me to change the way I view things and to realize just how insignificant most of the little daily “evils” I encounter are. 


This is my list from the last few days:


MONDAY: broke the yolk of the egg I was cooking.

TUESDAY: stepped on some dog poop barefoot.

WEDNESDAY: woke up at 3:30 because my son was crying, couldn’t go back to sleep.

THURSDAY: son went to bed about an hour later than usual. 


This has helped me to stop catastrophizing a ton. I was grumpy all week. And the worst thing that happened was I lost some sleep and some free time and also stepped in poo. If that’s the worst thing that happens this week, fortune’s smiling on me. 


Of course, if I were to get fired, or have a loved one die, it would definitely be worse than those things, but it would likely help me appreciate the good days all the more. 


Try giving it a shot, you’ll likely find that most troubles are not of dire consequence.

Virtue is the only good. Not the reach for contentment.

We embrace/love/wish for whatever happens/has happened and do not worry so much about how other's define/label that. We are happy in whatever is going on because what does that have to do with our character?

We deal with life as it happens, and do not lose our way. This includes opinions, authors and ""sophists"" we do not agree with. As Epictetus and Seneca both share, we can objectively describe a thing for what it is, we observe that a course called ""The Wealthy Stoic"" sounds like a contradiction and a confusion, but it isn't Stoic to then assign that value to the person beyond that observation.

This is Stoicism. If this doesn't feel right, then maybe there is a false impression somewhere in there to work through, or maybe this isn't the philosophy your nature is set to follow?

In love with an addict,"I'm in love with an addict, and I recently our relationship. When I broke up with him, I told him that part of the reason I was ending things was that I loved him too much to watch him kill himself. I was experiencing a lot of emotional distress because of his addiction and the way he was letting it impact his life and our relationship. He's a truly beautiful man, with a heart like none I've ever met and more love to give that I ever knew was possible, but was destroying his health and making it impossible to maintain a romantic relationship. 

From a Stoic perspective, I'm curious how to navigate our post-breakup friendship or whether I should not have one with him.  

Would growing as a Stoic mean learning to accept his self-destructive tendencies, and choose to serve as a support and friend if he chooses to get sober? Would it mean lovingly holding him accountable when he asks for support, and pointing out his patterns when he wants advice? 

Or would growing as a Stoic mean accepting that a leopard cannot change its spots, accepting that remaining in his life may be harming us both more than anything, and walking away?

My plates arrived all broken,"I'm going to move out of my mother's house in July but have already started buying some things and keeping them stored. A week ago, I bought a set of 10 plates from a fancy store, I spent some amount of money on it but nothing out of my reality. 

Today, 5 out of the 10 plates arrived completely shattered inside the box. I was disappointed at first, but I didn't feel angry or upset... I sat down with my broken plates for a minute and contacted the store, so far they didn't reply (the store has a reputation of bad customer service). 

I'm thinking about just throwing the broken plates in the trash (carefully packed of course) and buy new ones soon from a different place.
While I was sitting with my plates looking at them, it hit me so very hard that this is so out of my control and there's no point in being disappointed or mad, it's broken and that's it. I'll just ask for the money back and count my losses.",Stoicism,1704465221.0,t3_18z89jk,0.71,8

Woman I love is very hot and cold,"I know this is not a relationship advice forum but still trying my luck.

And since last one year our text increased, she starting sending pics, and I just started falling for her. She forced me to tell what I felt for her. I'm glad I could tell her that I loved her. But ever since then she's treating me very hot and cold. Sometimes she would be very interested giving all her focus, calling, etc. Other times she ignores me for days.

Question concerning the Stoic view on abuse from family.,"
I have some issues with a stoic view on abusive family and I’m curious how you all interpret the passage. 

Very quick backstory: After years of therapy I’ve stopped speaking with my mother due to narcissism and abuse. 

Stoicism has been one of the most valuable things in my life and has helped me through so much. I have been very troubled upon a re-reading of Epictetus and would love your interpretation.

“Duties are universally measured by relations. Is a man a father? The precept is to take care of him, to yield to him in all things, to submit when he is reproachful, when he inflicts blows. But suppose that he is a bad father. Were you then by nature made akin to a good father? No; but to a father. Does a brother wrong you? Maintain then your own position toward him, and do not examine what he is doing, but what you must do that your will shall be conformable to nature. For another will not damage you, unless you choose: but you will be damaged then when you shall think that you are damaged. In this way then you will discover your duty from the relation of a neighbor, from that of a citizen, from that of a general, if you are accustomed to contemplate the relations.”

In the book A Field Guide to a Happy Life, Massimo Pigliucci’s rewrites Epictetus in more modern language. Here is another example of a stoic response to abuse from family.

“But,” you say, “my mother has been bad to me.” Perhaps, but she is your mother nevertheless, and you should concern yourself with how you behave toward her, not how she behaves toward you. “But my brother has done me some harm.” What do you mean, “harm”? Has he forced you to change your considered opinions or the values you endorse? No, he can’t do that. Then there is no real harm. He may have behaved unjustly toward you, but that is his business. Your business is to behave toward him by considering who he is: your brother.

So, after years of therapy, I have broken off my relationship with my mother. It was a very difficult decision but the correct choice. Reading these stoic passages that I have posted really upsets me. Does Epictetus really expect someone to allow pain and suffering inflicted upon them just because you are related to them? Standing up for ourselves and choosing not to be harmed is within our own power, so I had thought I made the stoic decision to choose not to be harmed anymore. Perhaps this passage from Epictetus is a relic of ancient times in which you could never sever ties with family regardless of the situation.

What do you think?",Stoicism,1704445748.0,t3_18z2mw3,0.64,3
Lost,"

So right now I(20m) am in my third year of college and honestly I have no idea what I’m doing as in I don’t know what to do with my life. The bachelor that I’m studying for now is biology not because I’m necessarily interested in it but because engineering is too hard for me considering I suck at math and political science is also uninteresting to me.
All throughout my life/high school people would ask me what I was going to study and I would always tell them “I didn’t know” thinking that eventually I would know and I could answer their question and my question but here I am and I still don’t know. I haven’t found anything that really interests me nothing to the extent I could see myself devoting time and effort into it. I play a lot of video games but I don’t like it enough for me to learn how to make a game and I watch a lot of movies and TV shows, but don’t like them enough to pursue a career in cinema for example and to top it all off I’m not good at anything(no talent,no secret hobbies,nothing). I’m trying not to sound ungrateful, but to put it simply nothing is ever enough It all feels empty to me. People have told me that it’s normal to be directionless in this stage in life and I understand that but at the same time is very frustrating seeing my friends in college just knowing what they’re going to do with themselves whether it be veterinarians, lawyers, programmers you name it and I wish I could be like them. Needless to say, this is all having a negative affect on me is bad enough to go through life’s struggles, but I would say its worse when you don’t have a “why” to your struggles. I don’t feel like I’m asking for too much when it comes to just knowing what I should do. I’m not asking for that perfect dream job. All I want is to know what I should be doing with my life, something that I can see myself doing for a long time and be good at it, and get meaning from it but I don’t have that and I need help. When somebody asks me, who am I, what are you doing and what am I going to do I want to actually give a real answer. So please advise and general thoughts about it would be greatly appreciated.",Stoicism,1704471679.0,t3_18zaq3a,0.6,1
A Stoic's Code of Conduct and how to achieve Emotional Maturity and/or remedy Emotional Immaturity.,"I've been practicing Stoicism for a couple of years now, and I do see some improvements. So I am not a newbie and I know better that Stoicism is not about repressing emotions.

Like many of us, my upbringing was not perfect (and I have stopped blaming my parents long ago), and I had a lot of ""issues"".  I have come a long way, I do live a ""normal"" life, dare to say ""happy""; some people would even use the term ""successful"" to describe my life and me.

But I am still working on myself, constantly improving.

Recently I am working on my latent internal anger, and I have come to the realization that I am still, probably, Emotionally Immature.

I have got some good comments on this sub recently on related matters, and I am journaling multiple times a day, reflecting on things, and challenging my own *intrusive thoughts* and also my *Belief System* (aka BS).

I have read multiple times Massimo Pigliucci's *How to be a Stoic*, and William Irvine's *A Guide to the Good Life*; they are book good in giving practical examples of Stoic life.

I am looking to make a simple ""Stoic's Code of Conduct"", a list so to speak that I can review multiple times a day, and in case of emergency, and therefore I am asking 2 questions:

1. Do you have such a list or can you point me to one?
2. Can you please review my incomplete list below, and suggest additions/edits?

TIA

My Stoic Code of Conduct:

* Speak positively.
* Don't be sarcastic (I used to do it too much).
* Never complain.
* Judge a situation or a behavior, not the person.  What someone does is not the reflection of who they are.
* Never say anything negative about anyone (linked to the item above), even if it's true (this is regarding work).
* Pursue the Stoic virtues (of course), always.
* Apply the dichotomy of control, always.
* Don't give into consumerism, lean toward minimalism.
* Journal daily: at night reflecting on the day that just ended; in the morning planning my day.
* Be mindful every moment.
* Pay special attention when interacting with people, be mindful.
* When the mind goes into a spiral down a rabbit hole; just stop.
* You can do it. Whether you think you can or you can't either way you're right.
* No gossips.
* No drama ever.",Stoicism,1704420924.0,t3_18yv8qn,0.95,14

I was surprised by this. Having read the Meditations I had the impression that it was best to drive oneself strenuously into one's duties and enduring difficulties by accepting the present moment and modifying judgements. Seneca himself condemns laziness in his letters to Lucilius.

From what I understand Stoic logic was in some ways quite revolutionary and very distinct from some other ideas of the time (Aristotle being a prime example) and while no considerable body of work was preserved, what has been recorded is close to propositional logic which of course is very much in use in the modern age.

I then call a freind she lives with, the freind gives her the phone and my freind admits that shes already bought the stuff and shes been busy all day and didnt have time to reply or even call back. 

I know shes lying. In one of the messages i sent her, asking when she wants to go to buy her stuff, she diverts and asks a different question. It seems she was avoiding telling me, and im left wondering why. It seems she would have never admited shew has bought the stuff if i didnt gi the extra mile by calling her freind.  I am wondering why she didnt tell me shes already bought the stuff already. I know shes lying and i refuse to give benefit of doubt.

shes very arguementative and may not admit the lie. Confronting her may ruin the freindship, especially with her birthday coming up, it may be awkward if i attend.

A Life Direction through Determinism and Stoicism,"Some background: (skip if too long)

I'm 16, and lately I've been really struggling to do anything because of not knowing where I'm headed. It all began a few months ago. I was honestly really doing quite well, to which I mean I started being more responsible, disciplined and was focused on self-improvement. I slept and woke up early, took my studies seriously, did daily chores, etc.

I also journaled to write down my thoughts, which mostly consisted of how to improve myself and live better. On one of these journal sessions, I realized that my actions is mostly just problem solving. So I looked into how to problem solve. I read some stuff, and came to the conclusion that it simply boils down to: knowing WHAT to do, HOW to do that, and WHY do that. You might know where this is headed, but yeah, the ""WHY"" part really had me thinking. Why am I doing all this shit again? Why do I eat, sleep, study, have fun, and all the kit-and-caboodle?

So, naturally, I looked for an answer. If the question is ""why am I doing anything?"", then what I'm looking for is reason (or maybe purpose or meaning? idk I'm unsure still). I read about existentialism, absurdism, stoicism, and a few others, only enough to kinda get the gist of it, and I also did some personal thinking. This was where my mind has been for the past few months, and this lack of reason or direction or whatever, has really had me demotivated and depressed.

However, I think I've reached some sort of answer that I'm content with and I'd like to hear your thoughts about it.

&#x200B;

It goes as follows:

Determinism states that all actions and events result from other actions, events, or situations. The way I personally like to word this out is: ""what is"" determines ""what is to be"". ""What is"" simply refers to the state of stuff right now, and ""what is to be"" refers to how the state of how the stuff right now will be.

""What is"" includes me. What am I? What is the state of the stuff that is me right now? Well I am human. And a part of being human, of course, includes survival. But, it also includes the longing for happiness. And I personally think that the stoic philosophy of building character, having virtue as the goal, answers this longing for happiness.

What I'm essentially saying is: Stuff exists, and how these stuff exist, or ""what is"", determines how these stuff will exist, or ""what is to be"". A part of ""what is"" is what I am, and I am a human that longs for happiness among other things. This determines ""what is to be"", which includes my decisions and actions. Hence, I look for what'll bring me happiness, which I believe is found through the stoic philosophy.

(just to add, I recognize that determinism is usually brought up when discussing free will and responsibility, but here, I focus more on the idea it presents about how our actions is explicable by what we are and what other stuff are.)",Stoicism,1704420821.0,t3_18yv7e9,0.5,0
How to not judge people...,"How can I stop judging people?

When I see their test results I just automatically judge them and think to myself that they probably dont do anything in their lifes but be on their phones all day and dont do anything to change or better themselves. 

I feel like just because I focus on self-improvement, I judge everyone else for not being the same as me, i have the same problems with other views in my life, like with atheism - i dont believe in any gods, and in my mind when i see someone fateful to god i just judge them about how theyre being stupid. I know its wrong to think this way, i never let these thoughts out on other people, but I acknowledge that my mind thinks this way, and i want to change it",Stoicism,1704364912.0,t3_18ya882,0.74,10

I have trouble understanding this passage in the passage before this one, he is talking about all the relations in the world and the Constitution of the human mind to receive impressions in and that this must be the work of a God. Then he ends the passage with the following

"Anger, results and confusion","Ever been lied to? It's annoying, isn't it.

I feel like I've been lied to about a lot of things in my life. Most of them along the lines of ""Just do this and you'll be fine"". Well I did ""this"" and I wasn't fine. These were often people who had duty of care over me and I had little choice but to believe them and ironically were also the people who taught me that not telling the truth was a bad thing.

So deep down, I'm angry. At them for giving me instructions that lead nowhere, at me for being too weak or naive to get the results or to follow the instructions well enough.

If it weren't for that anger I would never have learned to stand up for myself when under attack, it has protected me.

I've been studying the 48 Laws of Power & The Prince. Are power, leadership, and the teachings of these works simply incompatible with Stoicism? Much of what they say make perfect, rational sense, but they don't seem to be in line with the actions of the philosophy.

Machiavelli says:
""Any man who tries to be good all the time is bound to come to ruin among the great number who are not good. Hence a prince who wants to keep his authority must learn how not to be good, and use that knowledge, or refrain from using it, as necessity requires.""

the stoic way must be like its okay i will search part time job etc so i don't depend on my parents again cause that what i can do

"best/modern French translation for Meditations/ ""Pensées""","Hi everyone, title says it all.

I'm about to finish reading Meditations (English translation by George W. Chrystal), so I want to next try my hand at the French translation. For a person learning French (slightly-higher-than intermediate level; I was certified level B2 I think a year or two ago), what modern or recent translation do you recommend? I also tried searching online (using ""meilleure traduction française pensées marc-aurèle"" and similar keywords), but the search results were vague and not as responsive as, say, when I tried searching for best English translations.

(I tried searching for a similar post, but while there are indeed some posts which have similarly requested for French translations, curiously, the responses have been deleted. Also, the FAQ only shows other English translations. But if I missed it, I do apologise and thank you in advance for pointing it out to me.)

Issue with stoicism practices.,"I bought the handbook for new stoics, and have been working through it starting this year, I've already hit something of a road bump, the first exercise is to take an aspect of your day and seperate and examine what was and wasn't in my control, the issue I'm having is that I don't do much at all, I mostly stay inside, watching youtube or playing video games, I'm diabled and thus can't work.

So I don't really have an ascept of my day to examine, the book suggests things such as lunch with a friend or a work meeting, but I have nothing similar to those, the only thing I've been able to write about is my usage of social media, but if I use that as my example I'll be writting the same thing for each day of the week.

I need your opinion - Marcus Aurelius was a common man?,"So recently I stumbled upon this YouTube channel that barely has any views. In one of their videos, they were saying that Marcus Aurelius was just a common man and not a mighty emperor.

In the video, they said ""Marcus Aurelius was a common man who knew a lot of people, that is why he is still relevant to this day"" 

I´m not sure if it's a language barrier for me and I have maybe misunderstood what they are saying but I think it's important to note that Marcus Aurelius was a powerful emperor yet he never fully bathed in that power or used it in any negative way.

Bushido and Stoicism,"I’ve seen here several people mention how stoicism has similarities to some eastern philosophies. Before I discovered stoicism for myself, I studied the samurai. I wanted to know why they were portrayed as calm people in media and culture. This is one of my favorite quotes and I believe it fits the stoic goal of calmness. Perhaps even fear of death. This comes from Inazo Nitobe (1862-1933). He was born into the samurai class, but was 6 when it was abolished. His book, “The Way of the Samurai” is one of two books that most influences samurai media. That and the Hagakure. 

“The Way of the Samurai” Chapter 4: Courage, the Spirit of Daring and Bearing

“The spiritual aspect of valor, is evidenced by composure - calm presence of mind. Tranquility is courage in repose. It is a statical manifestation of valor, as daring deeds are dynamical. A truly brave man is ever serene; he is never taken by surprise; nothing ruffles the equanimity of his spirit. In the heat of battle he remains cool; in the midst of catastrophes, he keeps level his mind. Earthquakes do not shake him, he laughs at storms. We admire him as truly great, who, in the menacing presence of danger, or death, retains his self possession; who, for instance, can compose a poem under impending peril, or hum a strain in the face of death. Such indulgence betraying no tremor in the writing, or in the voice, is taken as an infallible index of a large nature - what we call a capacious mind, which, far from being pressed or crowded, has always room for something more”

Is the first step to forgiving someone that you perceived wronged you to control your thoughts or your actions?,"There is someone who in the past hurt me. A family member.

I feel as though these are not passions since I am not allowing them to affect the way I act but they do seem to affect my thoughts. It’s something I’ve been struggling with for months. I’m not sure how to approach it further.

In order to be a good and just person should we correct lies we have told or bad actions we have done even if they will hurt the person?,"In an attempt to be a better person I am trying to right things I have done in the past and be an honest person in general. 

For example, in a joint business in the past I was under reporting revenue and over reporting expenses in order to pocket more of the profit. To right this wrong I have a cheque written for the difference to give to my partner. My question now arises in if I should tell him that I was stealing from him all this time. 

As I am someone he trusts immensely this would upset him and I am doing it to make myself feel better. 

I could alternatively lie and say ""I found some mistakes in the numbers, looks like you're owed this much more"". 

Is lying to make him feel better a stoic action?

I've analyzed this situation and I am not scared to tell him that I betrayed his trust. I am able to accept any fall out from it. I would obviously prefer to have him in my life as I consider him a friend but that is a decision I think he should make, not me. 

I feel as though I am starting to ramble now so I will stop shortly. 

I compared the situation to if I was told by a recent ex she was cheating on me the entire relationship. I would feel upset over that and think that it was unnecessary to tell me this additional information after we had broken up. 

The business is still running and I stopped playing with the numbers recently. 


This also made me wonder if we should go out of our way to correct any lies or misinformation we have given people or to just be honest going forward.

Shaving your beard,"Please excuse the paraphrasing, I do not have my copy with me.

Epictetus says that if one is to practice philosophy, their conviction should be such that they are willing to lose their head if another demands they behave in a manner contrary to their philosophy. This is conveyed early on in the discourses in a metaphor about shaving one's beard.

He also says that one should not try to pursue causes that are out of one's control, because not only will one disgrace themselves in doing this, they will have abandoned a pursuit in which they could have performed well. This is from enchiridion 37.

A topical example is a hypothetical US citizen that believes that US aid to Israel is cruel. This citizen decides to not pay their taxes, in accordance with their philosophy. But then they are jailed, preventing them from the good they could have done while not jailed, and Israel still receives the aid because there are hundreds of millions of tax paying citizens. 

Quote 2 implies it is a better idea to just follow the law and pay the taxes. Quote 1 implies that we should not care for the consequences.

Am I misunderstanding? Is there a discourses chapter that elaborates on enchiridion 37?

I made an inappropriate joke to someone and their reply was hurtful. How do I subvert my expectations of being apologized to?,"This is a fake scenario based off of a real problem I'm having.

I'm confused in how to feel and how to respond to they way someone reacted to a joke I made.

So let's say I, Jack, made a joke about vegans to my friend Mark, who is not a vegan but has told me previously that they don't like jokes at the expense of vegans.

After telling my joke, Mark said ""shut up, that's offensive"".

Now, upon reflection I realized that I made a mistake. There's no doubt in my mind that the initial mistake was mine. However I still feel hurt due to being told to shut up.

I have apologized for making the joke, and Mark hasn't apologized for his response. I feel like I expect him to apologize. Should I not?

This is something which isn't yet clear to me in the stoic teachings. I lack ""the wisdom to know the difference"". I know his apology is out of my control, but should (or could) I tell him that it was hurtful and that I would like if he doesn't do it again?

Roommate situation,"So I recently had a conversation with my roommate about the importance of putting organic trash in the organic bin instead of the garbage bin. Unfortunately, it didn't go as smoothly as I had hoped. My roommate responded with a passive-aggressive attitude, claiming that he wasn't the one primarily responsible for this issue and that he was, in fact, the one who took out the trash the most.  He then went on to indirectly accuse me of not putting dishes in the dishwasher and leaving them in the sink for an extended period. This exchange left me feeling as though I was the one at fault for bringing up the topic, and I'm worried that it might strain our roommate relationship.

Contradictory quotes?,"Dear Posse.

Does ugliness rub off?  Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius seem to disagree, or can Marcus Aurelius’ words be interpreted into “ugliness will only rub off, if you let it”?

“Avoid fraternizing with non-philosophers [i.e., people who don’t try to improve themselves]. If you must, though, be careful not to sink to their level; because, you know, if a companion is dirty, his friends cannot help but get a little dirty too, no matter how clean they started out.”

Epictetus, Enchiridion 33.6

And 

“When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they can't tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are unnatural.”

The Praxis of Developing a Stoic Mindset - How can we actually start to think and behave Stoically? Here are my thoughts on concrete steps to take to begin moving towards the Stoic ideal.,"# Introduction

It's not secret that as this subreddit has grown, a large number of the topics are people seeking Stoic advice. A lot of these posts are however misguided in a way - they seem to be  looking for a particular kind of solution that you might find in an algebra problem. They want something that they can plug into the equation to solve for X, and thus find a neat and tidy answer to their problem - whether that's a broken heart, the effects of childhood trauma, or disappointment at their lack of self-perceived accomplishment in their lives. Stoicism is not a framework for solving for a particular value of X. It is rather a way of deconstructing the problem such that you realize looking for X is the wrong approach entirely. 

The suffering that people describe as stemming from various events (my romantic partner left me, I feel empty and defeated) is the categorical mistake that Stoicism seeks to address. It is a radical and revolutionary reframing of the human experience that begins with the detachment of human value judgment from the events and consequences that are happening every second of our lives. In simple terms, Stoicism would say that the breaking of your relationship is not the source of your suffering, but your impression of it is. If you broke off an abusive relationship and were now freed from violence and oppression, you would see the end of a relationship as liberation. It is your impression and interpretation of the event which creates the condition of pleasure/pain in your mind. And so Stoicism stretches that to almost every single thing that we experience, and demands that we detach from judging things to be good or bad so that we are not living our lives at the mercy of chance and fortune. Virtue is the sole good, and our virtue can never be affected by anything that happens to us, including physical pain, destitution or death. This is of course simplistic, but I wanted to set the stage with a broad overview before getting to the point of this post, which is:

# **How do I *actually* start thinking and acting Stoically?**

**The first step in developing a Stoic mindset is to develop the habit of having structured reflection about yourself and your life.** This means not only thinking about what you are doing and how you are living, but taking active steps such as journalling, and structured review of your thoughts/actions which you revisit later on. The process of putting thoughts into writing forces you to order them and clarify them. Pure mental thinking is ultra-high bandwidth with tons of noise and emotional baggage that cloud the ideas, whereas writing is a kind of structured thinking that forces you to crystallize your innumerable thoughts, and serves as a record for your future self. Its hard to remember what you were thinking about even a week ago, and it's imperative to have a handle on the evolution of your thinking and feeling. 

So if you are at a loss at where to start, start writing daily. Write about your life and your thoughts every single day. What is happening and what is your judgment of what is happening? What do you want? What do you feel is missing? Alongside this, pick a Stoic text and begin reading it. Don't worry about commentary, just read it for yourself first. Slowly, you will see themes from Stoic texts crop up in your life. Reflect on them - are they applicable? Do you agree with the author? Do you find the ideas persuasive or do you disagree with them? Explain yourself and your thinking. Later on, return to your writing and see if your mind is changing. You will be shocked at what you wrote 1 month ago, 6 months ago, etc. It will be a sign of your progress, and this is critical because Stoicism is a journey of self-mastery, and of self-responsibility. It is imperative you keep a written record. 

# **I'm already reading and journalling - what now?**

Our goal is of course to begin changing our minds, and that means achieving some kind of control over our reactions in real-time. In my view, the critical step is looking to carve a space between **action** and **reaction** in the course of our lives. At first, there is no space - we can only reflect on things hours or days afterwards. But as we continue the process of reflection and meditation, it finally happens - we get a brief flash of space between an event and our impression of it. An example from my own life might look like this:

> *Here is a typically angering situation for me. I can see it unfolding. This is a huge inconvenience to me. This person is completely disrespecting me and my time. I feel my blood pressure rising and my emotions lifting. I want to show my anger to this person, but I know I will regret it later. *

And I would still react angrily. I would say something disrespectful back, raise my voice, and lose control of myself. But still - I had time enough to have the above discourse in my mind. I could recognize it all happening, and I still couldn't control it, **but this is the first victory.** I could see the impression forming. And so then you reflect on the fact that you are starting to see the impression forming, you write about it in your journal. And then it happens again. And again. And you fail again. But then one time you catch yourself and actually manage to shift your reaction a tiny bit. You curb your anger. You take a few breaths and instil calmness into the situation. You are still angry but you're doing better this time. It takes less time for you to cool off after. And afterwards when you journal, you realize that this is the first time you've ever been able to stop yourself before fully engaging in the emotional reaction.

We see posts like these on here as well ""Stoic success stories"" - small but important anecdotes where people relay a situation where they caught themselves about to react badly, and asserted control. These victories stem from the earlier step of creating that tiny space.

As you continue to pile up these 'victories', you assert more and more control over your reactions. In your reflections, you begin to truly understand that when people are being rude or disrespectful to you, it is a reflection of their own hardships and ignorance, and nothing to do with you. You start to truly understand that getting angry is handing ownership of your mind to another, usually a complete stranger, who has already forgotten about you while you are still brewing with rage from your interaction with them. And so it becomes more and more natural to simply not react in these situations. 

# The key is to keep it in mind

The general theme here is that in order to begin to think Stoically, you need REMINDERS to do so. You need some kind of process that injects the Stoic principles back into the active thinking patterns and not just the passive ones that are occurring in times of acute pain. I think for most people, that has to begin with active, regular journalling and reading the Stoic texts. The more you think and write on them, the more they will be in your mind. And the more they are in your mind, the faster you will finally achieve that first 0.01 seconds of space between action and reaction, and then that space will continue to get bigger as you gain control over your emotions and cognition. As you gain control, you start to actually see the process almost from a third person perspective. This creates the conditions for further control, for more space, and the process continues and you can sink deeper into the true Stoic mindset.

As you go further, you are not simply getting better at calming down - you are starting to see the events for what they are, and they lose the ability to affect you in the first place. You actually begin to understand implicitly, not just logically, the foundational truth of the Stoic mindset. The logical understanding of Stoic ideas is not enough - 99.9% of you understand them already, but that doesn't magically change your mind. You need repetitions and practice so that your brain grasps it on an emotional level as well. Over time, you are seeing the problem differently - there is no X to solve.",Stoicism,1704132452.0,t3_18w2gxi,0.93,59
What things are determine what things do. Is this true? What does stoicism have say to this?,"Here's the gist:

* Wise 16 year old gains consciousness 
* Doesn't know why he does what he does.
* Wonders ""what am I doing?"" and ""why am I doing it?
* What SHOULD I do and why SHOULD I do that?
* Wants a clear life direction.
* Tries to figure it out for months.
* Can't figure it out. Isn't satisfied with any answer. Finds despair instead.
* Has trouble doing anything cause of not knowing why he does what he does, or for that matter, why does ANYTHING at all do what they do?
* Reaches some sort of conclusion, which he still doesn't find satisfying so then asks reddit cause doesn't know where else.

~~~

The conclusion:

- Things just exists.
- These things exist in certain ways.
- The ways that these things exist can change.

This is reality.


What things are determine what things do, and what things do determine what things are to be.

ie. What a thing is and what surrounds that thing (the universe/ the earth/ society) determines what it does, and what it does determines what it becomes and what surrounds it becomes. 


If this is true, then:

What to do?
What you do is determined by what you are and what other things are.

Why do that?
What is done is done because of what you are and what other things are.

~~~

So is it that simple? I wake up, I eat, I bathe, I study, I draw, I choose a goal, I love, I survive etc. all because of what I am and what surrounds me? Is it logical?

Trouble with knowing which emotions are reasonable,"First: I mention some heavy thoughts, but I am in no active danger, so please don’t report this. I am in therapy, but I also want some logical input, because rationalising thoughts helps me. Thank you. 
 ———

To make it brief - I know that the right mindset can change *a lot*. That is what I struggle with the most, right after controlling my emotions (as in, not letting them control me). 


I am in therapy and have also started recently mood stabilisers, as my psych thinks the intensity of my emotions is not normal. But obviously I still need to work in therapy on actively calming myself and changing my mindset. I’m doing CBT which overlaps a lot with Stoicism. 


So:  I’ve struggled hard with guilt, shame, and as a result suicidal ideation for years. I often want to open up to my family about it, but I’ve been told even just breaking into tears over small disagreements is me being “manipulative”.  No words can convince my father otherwise, not even from my therapist. So just the idea of being vulnerable to my father (who has plenty reasons to be disappointed by and angry with me, as he is) and telling him “I don’t want to be alive anymore. And I feel guilty that I know I won’t ever attempt suicide because I believe it would be better for you. But I am too selfish even for that.” is terrifying. Not to be able to tell your own parent you wish to stop living, because you are used to negative responses to opening up, is so painful and invalidating. I don’t want pity from him, I want empathy and to feel loved. My suicidal ideation is real, and I need help. But it doesn’t go away from one therapy session, and I think beging honest about how you feel is important for well being. So not being able to be honest with my own father is… I am repeating myself. 


But is it “reasonable” or “okay” to feel sad that I can’t tell own father how I feel? Can I tell him anyway because it weighs so heavily on me, or should I keep it between myself and my therapist? Because isn’t the **reason** I’m sad that I care what he thinks? Is it “reasonable” in Stoicism that I want to trust and be loved by my parent, to want empathy from him? Or should I work on not caring what he thinks, because then, well, then I won’t let myself be controlled by my wish to get love from him? 


I am at a loss. To not care what my own father thinks of me seems so so cold and irresponsible. I am scared that if I don’t care what he thinks of me, I will might behave in ways that hurt him. 


But then, if he feels hurt, wouldn’t that be his responsibility and because of his mindset? 
But that sounds even colder. 


I don’t know what to think. I just want to be happy, and the man who said I need to ask for help more doesn’t understand that the best way for *him* to help me is to be empathetic.",Stoicism,1704150312.0,t3_18w9k4u,0.77,7

How to maintain relationship with parents while keeping my peace?,"Sorry, it might feel like a rant, but I don't know how to summarize what goes in my mind.

I ooz hate/anger in my head when I speak to my parents when they ask me to do things certain way. I usually listen for one or two times, and then in straight words, I tell them that I dont want to live that particular way  but if they want to, then it is their choice. My father  just switches the topic or hands over the phone to my mom. One time, when I recommended something then my mom said that she would listen from one ear and let it out from other. 

Part of me doesn't want to have any relationship with them, and the other part is like that they are growing old and live thousands of kilometers away.

2yrs ago, I stopped sharing my life with them over our daily calls unless it impacts them in some way. I really dont say much. I just listen to what they have to say about their life and leave it at it. This is out of respect what they have gone through to support me in whatever way, and I know they didnt have it easy.

However, I can't deny I question my choice to call them every single day because for them it doesn't matter as it's part of living life and I overthink. After all this, they try to associate with me, and I have noticed myself being instantly repellant to that association as I don't want to be like my parents. 

I don't mind being the bad person in their lives, but my heart doesn't allow me to cutoff ties or make them lonely or carry resentment as they age as it is not healthy.

People thinking I don't care,"Happy New Year all,

In practicing emotional control and not immediately reacting to a negative situation, has anyone else run into other people thinking you don't care?

Take for example, if a significant issue or mistake occured at work, I used to overreact to show coworkers and management how much I cared, but I eventually realized this caused me too much mental distress, and was not worth it in the grand scheme of life, it's just a job.

Since becoming a practicing stoic, I am getting the impression from others that my calm/indifferent reaction to situations makes them think I don't care, which is an issue concerning I am in management. 

Has anyone else run into this? My thought is my mental well being is more of a priority than what some boss might think of my level of engagement, and that an employer having an issue with your calmness probably isn't one to stay with.

\-*Darth Plagueis*, James Luceno

Yeah i know star wars is silly, but these quotes are the kind of thing that make me question some stoic principles.

Marcus Aurelius wrote to himself ""If it is endurable, then endure it. Stop complaining."" but isn't complaining a natural human response to stress? An stoic can even fool himself thinking that he can endure everything ""endurable"" only to snap like a brittle twig at some point.

Isn't having hope and goals two of the most powerful driving forces in humans? Yet stoicism says hope is the twin brother of fear.

On discussing other people,"An excerpt from Simplicius’ commentary on *Enchiridion* 33 follows this chunk:

> But above all things take care not to talk of other People, neither so as to censure their Conduct, nor to be lavish in their Commendation, nor to make invidious Comparisons between one and another.

The commentary: 

> But above all things, he gives us warning not to entertain our selves, and our Company with talking of other People; neither so as to call their Behaviour to Account, nor to be profuse in their Praises, nor free in making Comparisons between one Man and another, as That this Lady is handsomer than That, or this Man Braver, or Honester than That, or the like. Now there is nothing more evident, than that this Topick does in a more than ordinary manner divert the Soul from its self, and its own Business; for it makes Men busie, and curious, and impertinent, extreamly inquisitive, and troublesome where they have nothing to do. But why should this (you'll say) do so more than any other? And what can our talking of other Men have in it worse than the Subjects mentioned before?

> To this we may reply, That the Person to whom the Advice is here directed, being one who hath made some progress in Philosophy, as not so likely to entertain himself with those trivial Matters, as with something that relates to Mankind, and their Affairs and Actions. So that it was convenient to draw him off from those things especially, which his own Inclina∣nations would most dispose him to; and there∣fore he adds that Emphatical Caution, But above all things.

> Besides, though it be true, That the same Affections are stirred in us by both Discourses a∣like, (for we are insensibly drawn in to love and hate things and Men by talking of them) yet there is one peculiar Vice attends our Conver∣sation, when we pretend to give Characters of other people; which is, That it strangely swells one with Vanity and Pride, and Contempt of others. For whoever he be that pretends to sit in Judgment upon other Mens Conduct, does it out of some imagined Excellence in himself, which he fansies gives him a Right to arraign his Neighbours. And besides, any mistake in our Judgments of Men, is more inexcusable, and of infinitely worse Consequenee than if we pro∣nounce wrong in those other trifling Matters; and therefore we should be very sparing and tender in this Point.

Reflecting on Ryan,"I was blown away when someone on this subreddit pointed out to me that Ryan Holiday's debasement of this philosophy has reached the point of him creating a site called ""[The Wealthy Stoic](https://www.thewealthystoic.com/)"" to openly shill Stoicism as a get-rich-quick scheme.

For years I have been telling people his approach is a poorly disguised get-rich-quick scheme. What he's done has taken all of the cleverness out of that observation - now anyone with eyes can make that observation, which makes me feel a lot less original (and that could be a good thing).

It doesn't anger me when I look at the ""Wealthy Stoic""; the feeling is more like bemusement. Stoicism is exactly the opposite of what he's selling - it's just remarkable that he's chosen such a staunchly ascetic philosophy as his basis for selling people their own greed back to them. Perhaps wrapping one thing up in the other somehow makes the grift more effective.

As the new year rolls in and I start moving towards my fifth year of Stoic practice, it's somewhat interesting to reflect on the fact that feeling as though Ryan Holiday was trying to scam me is what initially sent me to Epictetus, and learning from Epictetus is what unlocked the benefits of the philosophy for me. I had just started recovering from my drug addiction, and I was reading The Daily Stoic and another one of his books (possibly ""The Obstacle is the Way"" but I cannot quite recall). As I read I got the distinct sense that I was reading trite garbage attached to a sales funnel by a person who didn't *really* care for their subject matter, and who was disturbingly enamored with extremely wealthy people who had diddly-squick to do with Stoic philosophy. Feeling certain there must be more value to the philosophy than what I was being given, I googled something like ""who is the most respected Stoic"" and was directed to Epictetus. I purchased my Penguin Classics copy of the Discourses (Kindle edition of course - I wanted to start immediately) and I never looked back.

I can recall an overwhelming sense of joy and relief when I realized that not only was the philosophy far from the trite, vague nonsense Holiday was portraying it as, but I was reading one of the most profound forms of thought I'd ever seen written down - a distillation of all the wisdom I'd acquired in beating my addiction, plus a cognitive mountain of completely verifiable and entirely unique claims about the mind that I'd never have been able to come up with on my own, and which I now use every single day when reasoning about how to live my life. 

I live an honest life. I feel happy - I feel like I never lack courage and that I do not need to lie to anyone. I have a wife I love and I'm content with what I have - truly content, as in if I had my current circumstance for the rest of my life I'd die happy. Better yet, if every single object I owned were lost in some freak accident tomorrow, I'm fairly sure I'd be no less content - I might need a week to get my bearings, I'm far from a Stoic sage after all, but I doubt I'd need much more than that. 

It's strange to feel that way, and to have felt such a profound benefit from the practice of this philosophy, only to then see the person I once thought of as its titan looking haggard and exhausted, shilling get-rich-quick schemes on a scammy-looking website. It drives home a point the Stoics make themselves - that the wealth and power of the Emperor counts for nothing. To Ryan Holiday, Stoic philosophy is nothing but a way to grift - like any criminal, he makes his money robbing the unaware and scamming the credulous. To me, the philosophy taught me how to be happy. When I help people to understand Stoicism I don't do it for money, and I get to feel honest at the end of it, something I suspect Ryan Holiday hasn't felt about himself in a very long time.

Happy 2024 everyone. Let's all try to surpass Ryan Holiday this year. ",Stoicism,1704068442.0,t3_18vkufu,0.92,85
Re-reading Epictetus. General tips?,"Cyberstoa:

I read Epictetus once months ago.  I don’t seem to have gotten much out of it.  There was lots going on in my life, so it could have been for a number of reasons.

It appears, however, that Stoicism is a philosophy/practice that might help me live a “better” life.  I keep being told on this sub that to understand Stoicism I need to at least start with understanding Epictetus.

To that end, I will begin re-reading it.  Something like a chapter a day.

*Is there any general advice I could keep in mind as I embark on this exploration?*

- if you struggled to get much out of it on your fist read and were able to get much more on your second, your advice would be particularly useful to me 
- if you’re on the spectrum (unclear whether I am), your advice might be particularly useful to me

"""Don't be overheard complaining... not even to yourself.”","This quote by Marcus Aurelius emphasizes the importance of not letting any attention flow towards expressing your discomfort with a situation. 

Due to this quote, I notice how often I complain about the most minor issues for the sake of conversation. I am surrounded by many people who complain about things in every other sentence, and it has conditioned me into believing that I must always find issue with something. Even things that in no way influence my life, I will complain because I am not comfortable with silence.

Hello everyone. Needed some information and guidance from fellow stoicists. Would mean a lot to me.,"It's gonna be pretty unorganised so please bear with me.

My first point of concern is if I am doing something wrong or harming myself in any way by studying and applying stoicism?? That's my biggest concern right now. I am reading stoicism a lot and it has brought to me a lot of changes. I need to know if I am setting myself up for some bad outcome.

Here's some changes that I have observed after starting stoicism.

1. I have stopped getting post jut clarity. I know it sounds silly but it's a major concern for me. I used to have post nut clarity for when I used to feel low or needed to clear my mind. Now I can't. But I do get some resemblance of post nut clarity when I am reading stoicism. So I don't really know if that's a good thing or bad thing.


2. I have become way better in making friends. Earlier I used to have trouble getting respect from people now I am doing good not as much as I would like but far better than earlier. But I think I have lost my charming capabilities too. Earlier I could enjoy parties and be fun there too. Now I just dont see any point in parties. Everytime I see someone enjoying parties and getting out of control, I start judging them which is a wrong thing.


3. My other concern is that girls don't follow stoicism and it makes me prone to getting cheated on. Somehow I can't shake the feeling that getting complacent and indifferent leads to your partner getting a free hand and cheating on you.


4. I would really appreciate a mentor who has been actively practicing stoicism for a long time now.


Thanks guy in advance.",Stoicism,1704139098.0,t3_18w53bk,0.5,0
Holiday's Influence,"Just thought I'd mention this since I've been seeing some posts about ryan holiday. 

I've seen Stoics here mentioned that despite the twisted and misconstrued picture holiday paints about Stoicism, many people end up finding true Stoicism. Therefore, holiday may not be doing too much harm, but rather a benefit to people. 

I'd like to challenge that by telling my experience. 

I first heard of Stoicism in college, around 2016. I don't recall if it was on a podcast or a YouTube video or an article, but I came across holiday talking about the Meditations and Marcus Aurelius and Stoicism. 

And when I heard him, I easily saw he was just talking bullshit. And I completely disregarded Stoicism too. 

Fast forward, I graduated and got a job in finance in 2018. And one day while at a colleagues desk, I noticed he had the Meditations of Aurelius. This seemed to me to be a confirmation of what holiday was selling: Stoicism as some broski, hustle, self help bullshit that would be big with finance bros (like my colleague).

Of course I was wrong to associate Marcus Aurelius and Stoicism with holiday's bullshit. It wasn't until this year that I really got into Stoicism. And in all of those years, I didn't give Stoicism a chance because I (erroneously) associated Stoicism with bullshit self help. 

To be fair to me though, (and my point), holiday, in my experience, did not only not lead me to Stoicism, but also contributed to the impression that Stoicism was just a bunch of hustle culture self help bullshit. 

I could only speculate how better my life would have been had I given Stoicism a chance and read the Discourses. But that's futile. 

So just as holiday might help bring people to Stoicism, he might also help people push Stoicism away. And so, in this way, holiday might not be helping people. 

What's left for us is to simply guide people away from holiday and redirect them to Stoicism.",Stoicism,1704097173.0,t3_18vsd29,0.71,6

Stoic values and Career,"I recently began reading a translation of Epictetus’ works. In one part of it, he says it is better to be poor and starve to death in tranquility than to live anxiously in abundance. He also says “you can always win competitions in which winning is up to you”.

Now I have recently decided to take a big leap in my career by giving an extremely difficult exam and move abroad. My reasons are that I will be at the top of my career (and very good at my job) with a significant improvement in pay and a better work life balance. My reason for leaving my country is bad work culture & toxicity, being undervalued, bad working hours. The whole process of moving abroad is extremely difficult and taxing. Reading the above stoic advice has got me confused because this goes directly against it.

I really do want to achieve things and be pretty good at my job. Pay is secondary. However, I do value a good work life balance.

He partially agreed, but then said “What if anger at an injustice motivates me to do a good thing?

Responsibilities,"I know that the idea of control is talked about to excess. What I can control what I can't control what I should try to control or other misunderstandings. I don't like the word control and I personally think it's a bad translation of the concept. 

Isn't it more productive to instead concentrate on what our responsibilities are? That's a much easier question to answer. What is your responsibility and what isn't your responsibility? Are you properly accepting responsibility for the things you say and do? 

Some things are our responsibility and some things aren't. Trying to accept responsibility for the actions and reactions of others does a disservice to them as maybe they're supposed to be learning a lesson. Trying to make someone else responsible for my actions and reactions does me a disservice because it removes my opportunities to learn and grow. 

For example if I had a child, to say I'm in control of the child would be not very correct. But I'm definitely responsible for the safety of the child as far as I'm able. I can't control the safety of anyone 100 percent.

Today I went from being right to being wrong. So much for my Stoicism practice.,"Today I was wronged. Someone did something.

I remedied, took matters into my own hands, and with effort and work, I remedied someone's malice or stupidity (Occam's razor).

Stoicism teaches us: 

* I did well. I used wisdom, courage, and justice.
* Now move on, continue to practice virtues, and - why not - do great things with your life.
* It's all done and over with.

But I had to confront that person, ask them why they did what they did. They lied and turned things around, accusing me of not telling the truth. So not only they wrong edme, but now they were trying to do the switcharoo on me? And falsely accusing me?

I tried to reason with them, nope, there was no way. I distanced myself and I reported to their company.  Then, later on, on my way out, I picked up the conversation again, which continued on the same note; till I lost my temper.

So, from being on the right side of the fact I become the villain. I was, the a-hole.

And this is where Stoicism is correct:

* What had happened (when the person wronged me) was outside my control.
* I was able to control some actions that I took to remedy.
* The entire event, now in the past, is 100% outside my control. There's nothing that I can do to undo what was done. Stoicism teaches me to do nothing, because there's nothing to be done. That is the wise thing to (not) do, that is the just thing do to, that would be a manifestation of moderation.

The actions that I took instead, the things I said, the letting my anger take over losing my cool were my doing, I did that, I allowed that, I went into the rabbit hole and continued to go down.

And now I can't sleep (ruminating) and I have been re-living those events for the past few hours. What a waste of life.

Now more than ever I see how the Stoic teaching are correct, always seek to be virtuos, by practicing wisdom, justice, courage, and moderation.

And by distinguishing what is within our control and what is not; and act accordingly.

And to be aware of impressions, since:

> We form our judgments and opinions based on what the Stoics called “impressions.” In broad terms, all stimuli (and our unthinking interpretations of them) are impressions.

Today was an opportunity for me to practice Stoicism at its best. If I had done that it would have been very low effort, just ""doing nothing"" really. I could have moved on with my life, doing something productive in the past few hours, and by now I would be sleeping like a baby.

My life is indeed the summation of the choices that I make, and Stoicism is a great co-pilot, if I choose to follow its advice. Everything that matters is 100% within my control. What is not doesn't really matter.",Stoicism,1704003082.0,t3_18v16fa,0.94,15
I'm a coward,"So , recently I was at a train station , trying to book a ticket at a booking booth and I was the first guy to put the ticket in line....later another guy came and argued that he was the first to put the ticket and even though I tried to reason with him he just escalated to the point where he verbally abused me and at that point I have gone to the railway police but he( the police man) said he is not in charge and told me to go to another police station which was in another location ( even though he was in that train station he refused to help me and I don't know why?)so I had no idea what I should do and returned to the booth and he again escalated the situation and I gave up on the situation.As he was trying to book the ticket first (the booking will start in a few minutes), the booking officer said that he cannot book the ticket since the train has already departed, so this guy had a verbal fight with the officer too and left the booth and I ended up getting my ticket first.But deep down I know that if the guy's train was available he would have got the ticket first and I couldn't stop him even though he was wrong.

I haven't been able to stop beating myself up after that situation and had many resentful fantasies as to hurt him or kill him... stuff like that or either kill myself ( but again my mind says if you are going to kill yourself then kill him first and then kill yourself).

This is not a test. This is the real thing.

When your 40 minute drive becomes two hours or your spouse uses more plates and forks than they need and it's your turn to do the dishes or a non-human animal under your care needs to shit some time around 4 am and you always prefer it be outside of the house so you wake up your brain, raise your body temperature a bit and go outside, sometimes you find yourself contorted.
All tied up in a knot for the duration of the bad thing. You're annoyed or angry. You wish to be in a different mental state.

Ask yourself:

Is this not life? In these moments when my (probably not deeply thought out) immediate preferences aren't met, can I not be satisfied? Can I only be satisfied if what I think I want is what I get? No. That seems like asking for trouble. Pre-meditated suffering. 
If I can learn to enjoy traffic then I'll always be satisfied.

My goal is to go from 
""oh, no. There is heavy traffic. My will and desires have been thwarted by circumstance. I will now lament what I cannot have"" 
to

"Dealing with sexual frustration, loneliness and weak social skills","Hi all,

I'm a male 28 working as a software engineer. Career wise I'm in a good position and learning everything day by day. But however I found out that I'm quite lonely and doesn't have any plans for new year whereas my friends have plans with their wives and girlfriends. Also lately I have been sexually frustrated and all I do is masturbate when I'm all alone. I am having hard time accepting I have terrible social skills and can't get girls even though I'm a good looking guy. I have been going to gym and improved my physique. But it didn't gave me much confidence. How can I deal with these things and move on. I really want to improve myself. But I feel like I don't have the patience to go through lot of rejection.

How come one stay Optimistic whilst pracising Stoicism or Premeditatio Malorum?,"Although I do not study Stoicism as often as before because of responsibilities and emotional decline, my knowledge of Stoicism has started to drift off I think and I'm confused about certain things.

I have been practicing negative visualization quite regularly for 5 months, I have noticed it may help me sometimes go on with with my tasks accepting the consequences, but as a side effect negatively affect my mindset and expectations and other times completely paralyzes my expectations and impressions of the matter.

How to think when some people are facing hard times (& unfortunate incidents) while you are relatively well off?,"(post is convoluted and might not be comprehensble, I don't know how to express my feelings. )


two incidents made me this ask the question. seeing homeless person and another who is suffering from toxic relationship.

whenever I see homeless person, I feel terrible and physical unease. I usually see on shopping street or when I come out from eating at restaurant, which means I also feel guilty for spending money. (but you can't live without doing that) I don't spend on unnecessary things and don't eat at fancy places, I am still a college student and don't eat out often and most expensive meal I had on my own is $12 and that too twice or thrice a year.  But when I eat I usually see homeless person as I walk home from that place. I donate change I have but still I feel almost depressed. q's like Do I deserve the nice food I just had? why is that person suffering in cold outside but I go to nice, warm house? 


I am aware of very close person I know who suffered domestic abuse and had their life turned upside down, their religious family recognize the abuse but don't want them to divorce. 

after becoming aware of such things I become sad and it feels bad to do things I do and indulge in which are not necessary but essential to get on with my life. (like putting on nice fragrance when going to job interview, while hearing someone I know crying because of abusive relationship feels .... ) 

the essence of Stoicism dictomy of control. 
 these are the things i don't have control over, so focus on things I have control over. but feels odd to engage in some things while you see suffering.",Stoicism,1703964857.0,t3_18unmvd,0.63,2

I’m reading meditations and phrases such as “as stoic is a good and kind person who servers the community” are things that (special as a dentist and healthcare professional) I took to my heart

Perhaps I’m just tired, but today I was bombed by the thought that my chronic illnesses 100% prevent me from being happy, so I’m excluded from the benefits of Stoicism. I was stuck and couldn’t seem to find anything that I’ve read so far to help me out.

"""Isn't the foolishness of a few a more precious commodity than the wisdom of the masses?""-Fate Zero","Gilgamesh: I am fond of lives of hubris. People who harbor grand ambitions without realizing that they are unequal to the task. The mere sight of such people gives me great enjoyment. There are two kinds of arrogance. One where you are unequal to the task and one where your dreams are too big. The former is common place stupidity...but the later is a rare species that is difficult to find.

Kirei: But they are identical in that they are both fools, are they not?

Gilgamesh: Isn’t the foolishness of a few a more precious commodity than the wisdom of the masses?There are those who were born human but harbor wishes that man was not meant for...and have renounced their humanity in its pursuit. I never grow weary of watching their grief and despair. Kirei, what of you?(dialogue from fate zero)

When I read alittle about Gilgamesh, the story says he wished to become a God, one of the Gods. To which the gods agreed, giving him a series of trials which if he passed, he would become a God. One of them involved staying up without sleep for seven days and seven nights which he failed. So in that paragraph where he ""never grows weary of watching grief and despair"", he's engaging in abit of Schadenfreude against himself and all like him. The Stoic sage is an ideal, obtainable? I don't know, but would the stoic sage be considered a human or a God?, a God I think. So isn't it's pursuit a form of renouncing one's humanity on some level? Plato's philosopher king encourages himself  in  his Meditations to ""stick to what seems right""(the best goal to achieve, the one we fall short of when we fail), and to ""celebrate behaving like a human being, however imperfectly"". Well, I feel like we should have a Stoic Failure Story tag to encourage empathy, vulnerability and authenticity even further in this community.

 Arthur Koestler theorized that; when children are impersonating adults, a comedian is impersonating a public figure, men are disguised as women and women are disguised as men. The impersonater is perceived as himself and as somebody else at the same time. That while this situation lasts, ""the two matrices are bissociated in the spectators mind. And while his intellect is capable of swiftly oscillating from one matrix to the other and back, his emotions are incapable of following these acrobatic turns. They are spilled into the gutters of laughter as soup is spilled on a rocking ship. Here I am thinking about Chrysipuss, who Seneca believed ""saw the very bottom of truth"" dying of laughter. Koestler further adds that ""we are literally ""poisoned"" by our adrenal humours, reason has little power over irritability or anxiety. It takes time to talk a person out of a mood, however valid the argument;passion is blind to better judgment; anger and fear show physical after affects long after their causes have been removed. If we could change our moods as quickly as we jump from one thought to another, we would be acrobats of emotion"". And I'm not sure why but this brings to mind Arriana Huffington's quote, ""sleep is a feature of the human operating system, not a bug"". Which is why Gilgamesh probably failed to become a God. ""But what says Zeus? ""Epictetus, if it were possible, I would have
made both your little body and your little property free and not
exposed to hindrance. But now be not ignorant of this: this body is
not yours, but it is clay finely tempered. And since I was not able to
do for you what I have mentioned, I have given you a small portion
of us, this faculty of pursuing an object and avoiding it, and the
faculty of desire and aversion, and, in a word, the faculty of using
the appearances of things; and if you will take care of this faculty
and consider it your only possession, you will never be hindered,
never meet with impediments; you will not lament, you will not
blame, you will not flatter any person.""_Discourses 1.1. I heard Peter Theil once say that if someone could innovate a pill that would safely eliminate the need  for sleep, he would move the world from zero to one. In a way though, this person would be considered a fool, the same way we think of Socrates, Diogenes, Epictetus as having moved the world from zero to one for championing a philosophy that has stood the test of time. And yet I feel these guys where probably considered fools on some level in their time, just as I believe they would be considered fools in my current society if they lived now as they lived then. ""..the truly original geniuses are rare compared with the enormous number of talented practioners; the former acting as spearheads, opening up new territories which the later will then diligently cultivate. There are periods of crisis, ""creative-anarchy"", leading to breakthroughs to new frontiers, followed by decades, or centuries of orthodoxy, consolidation, stagnation and decadence-- until a new crises arises, a holy discontent which starts the cycle again....""_The Act of Creation.

Making excuses and justifying for people that wrong me.,"Whenever people wrong me and treat me unfairly, I get angry at first but then I begin to find them a lot of excuses for their behavior and make up reasons for why they are the way they are. In the end, I give up on my rights or cause and resign myself to thinking that it is what it is.

Today I dealt with a toxic person in a stoic way,"Long story short 2023 was a really bad year for me, I was learning about stoicism but got away from the path at some point and let my negative emotions and anxiety dominate me 

I was super anxious about a college exam and so asked my friend if I could go to his house and say that I was worried, after that I got a bunch of messages from his jealous and egocentric girlfriend (who I used to call my friend) calling me a bitch that I was trying to have sex with him and saying that I was ugly and etc 

I tried to explain that I just wanted someone to talk with and even said that I was aroace but she ignored it

After that I noticed that I need stoicism back to my life and read meditations and took the idea of the 2.1 text “ I shall meet with the busybody, the ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial. All these things happen to them by reason of their ignorance of what is good and evil. But I who have seen the nature of the good that it is beautiful, and of the bad that it is ugly, and the nature of him who does wrong, that it is akin to me, not [only] of the same blood or seed, but that it participates in [the same] intelligence and [the same] portion of the divinity, I can neither be injured by any of them” 

And realised that that’s how she is, she’s aggressive and insecure and there’s nothing that I can change about it, today she tried to hurt me again and I simply ignored her, why bother with toxic people ?",Stoicism,1703875341.0,t3_18tu41m,0.93,70
FOOD ADDICTION,"I am 19 years old and I live with my mom. I’ve been dieting since I was 15 and I have lost 60lbs total, but lately I have been having trouble keeping off the weight and I binge eat. I noticed it was much easier to stick to my diet when I was living with my grandpa as there was no food or people to tempt me to eat. MY QUESTION: do I stay at my moms house and grapple with my diet or do I move to my grandpas house where it’s easier to stick to my diet?",Stoicism,1703949354.0,t3_18uhsmr,0.56,1
How do I control my frustration towards others?,"Recently I’ve felt like I’ve been getting angry or frustrated over the smallest things, including statements from my parents. I’ve tried to calm my emotions, meditation and other techniques but I end up either yelling or getting unnecessarily angry at them due to miscommunication and not being on the same page. 

A recent example of this is my mum nagging me on getting a job (it has been a year since I’ve been unemployed) however during the start of the year she stopped me from getting/applying to new jobs due to my studies and exams. Now in these couple of weeks she’s  been complaining why I wasn’t working throughout the year, saying that, after being unemployed I “gave up” and was “too lazy”to find a job to her friends on the phone. In addition, she also complains/yells that the reason of no jobs accepting me was due to my appearance?!?! That it was because of my moustache and bleached blonde tips (note I am Asian, and she dislikes how I do not look like the stereotypical southeast Asian). Moreover, she sometimes doesn’t realise I’m trying my best, yes I agree I can be lazy and impractical, but they always disregard on what I Do and focus on what I Don’t (not sure if that made sense haha)Like I’ve been really trying my hardest to find a job. This lead me to lashing out and having an argument about it, and yet in the end nothing was understood between us on what we were trying to state, and she ended up pushing it off and blaming herself, that “it’s all her fault”. The same scenario has occurred with just different topics and statements ending in her blaming herself for being a bad mum.

This always made me feel bad, every time I’ve had an argument with my family members I always reflect on what I said and what I should’ve done instead of what I did with my actions, hoping that next time I’m met with this situation I can stop it from getting any worse. 

And I always remember that it is also their first times at living life and that they are also trying to figure their own lives out. With this I really do love my mum and I know she wants the best for me, I never want to see her sad or feel like a failure, she has gone through a lot of struggles and done so much for me, but sometimes our misunderstanding and miscommunication gets under my skin which leads to my outbursts of frustration towards them. 

But I hope that next time I’m able to calm myself in these scenarios so that we are able to communicate better, to be in the same page.

Any tips, techniques, books can help me out would be appreciated!!!

how can I stop worrying about these things that are out of my control," Title. I am an 18 year old guy, and for the past week, I have been experiencing fatigue, nausea, dizziness, and derealization. I was in a very bad rabbit hole a couple days ago, that I still am some-what still in, but have gotten ALOT better.

I kept googling, searching on reddit, trying to figure out what was wrong with me, and so I started to think I had: long covid (since i got it in july) , CFS, diabetes, kidney disease, bppv, dysautonomia, candida overgrowth (which ive now found out is fake), sibo induced symptoms (since i have gi issues for over a year now) , gastritis induced symptoms, you name it and i probably thought I had it.

I've found out alot about myself while going through this whole rabbit hole, and I've realized that im not really scared of ""death"" per say, I am more scared of not living my life because of a chronic illness not allowing me to live my life, and there for because I keep worrying about that, I don't really live my life.

My anxiety has gotten so bad, that now I can't really go to the gym without thinking I am having a heart attack or I keep focusing on the littlest things when working out. Like how much I yawn during my workouts. While I do think most of my symptoms are from my anxiety, I just can not help but think in the back of my head that there is some chronic condition that I have, that is also causing these symptoms. I just don't know what to do. I am trying to look for a therapist, and potentially get an evaluation done to see if maybe I'll need anti-anxiety meds?

My question basically is: how can I stop worrying about these things that are out of my control like dying, or developing a chronic illness that doesn't allow me to ever function or live my life again, and while all my friends are out partying or living life, I will be bed ridden and depressed.",Stoicism,1703889378.0,t3_18tzixa,0.83,8
How do I not be obsessed with my appearance?,"Ever since I was a child I have always been self conscious about how I look. Over the years I have gone on a dozen fad diets and am always on and off going to the gym. 

Here is the thing, when I am fit I get more attention, people give me the benefit of the doubt more, people trust me more, my friends want to be around me more, I have way more success in dating. Anyone who has been both ugly and attractive has lived through and knows this. There are also many research studies that prove that attractive people are perceived as more likable, receive higher salaries, and get far lower prison sentences. 

Now, I have read enough stoicism to know the stoics thought appearance to be an indifferent because it has nothing to do with one’s character.

Are we always in control of our thoughts and reactions?,"I'm completely new to Stoicism and currently reading ""The Little Book of Stoicism"" as my introduction to the philosophy.

I've come to the point in the book where freedom of choice is being covered in depth, specifically the idea that we're unable to control external factors in our lives however we always have control over how we perceive and react to these things, the section also mentions that only we have the power to ruin our lives.

I'm struggling with these concepts a bit.

I believe we can control how we react and behave to an extent but only within our given biological parameters paired with the environmental stressor. I think certain situations are harder for some, easier for others.

E.g. 

- There are people who have behavioural difficulties that descrease impulse control
- There are others with severe mental health issues which can cause executive dysfunction
- Addicts exist whose brains will crave a substance as though they would die without it (they may also suffer with one of the other bullet points to boot)

While a ""good"" choice can still be made, the ability is reduced when compared to neurotypicals with good mental health.

Despite the above, I've still found the ""You can always control how you react"" approach really helpful. My worst life decsions have been made when emotions are running high, there have been had countless past worries that I've tortured myself with causing unnecessary suffering.

I've tried to adopt a more mindful approach when my emotions are high and I've seen good results... however there's a limit. If lost everyone I cared about tomorrow, I would be unable to remain calm in the same way Viktor Frankl did or see this as something indifferent to my eudaimonian. (Things we cannot control being seen as ""perferred indifferents"" at best.) My happiness is partly tied in with those I love and I'm not sure I'd want that to change because it would feel like cutting myself off emotionally. I get that it's unhealthy to entirely rely on those around us for happiness, but for me to care is to be emotionally invested. I believe that to love is to accept the possibility of emotional pain.

I'd like to get thoughts from those more familiar with the philosophy though please.",Stoicism,1703894447.0,t3_18u1fx5,0.83,8

Overcoming a major life mistake,"Would appreciate some guidance on how might a stoic best navigate a major life mistake?

I feel humiliated and defeated.  I know the past cannot be changed.  So all I can do is calmly set about dealing with the consequences in the present.

My mind, traditionally very determined and focused, is lacking the discipline to stay away from the humiliation mindset, the negative self talk, and the desire to keep going back to the past to fix things.  I allowed the initial situation to jar me so deeply that I fell in a vicious cycle.  That cycle drained everything out of me.  I speculate that’s why my previously strong mind seems almost unruly now.

How does one regain one’s head after losing it?  I don’t know if perhaps any of you has had any personal experience with this.

Stoicism in the face of injustice,"I'm wondering, as I haven't been through all the literature yet, how do stoic deal with severe types of injustice.

For example: A mother fought very hard to safeguard her child from an abusive husband.
The child is safe now.
However, disease and misfortune strikes the mother and after a long struggle, she dies, leaving her child vulnerable again.
All the while, the abusive father runs rampant, never being held accountable for his deeds, experiencing the bare minimum of bad luck.
Worst case scenario, custody gets transfered to the father.

In a more severe case, this is the story of a sibling; or your mother.

How do stoics interpret these events; how do you deal with the sense of injustice in such situations?

Moving from fear of death to acceptance of it,"I’m looking for some stoic perspective on thoughts of death and negative visualization.

Recently, a few months ago, I had a surgery and ever since then my little mind is obsessed with the thought of the implant causing my death eventually. Thus, I notice I fear exercise, stopped hobbies, seeing friends, have no motivation for life. Some would call this a depressive episode, and suicidal thoughts were there for a few weeks but I overcame them after some time in therapy. As residue I feel like the fear is a  constant.

While I know that these are just thoughts, they seem to subconsciously define my living now. I keep analyzing my symptoms, the physical pain sensations, and mind feeds me images of me dying. And instead of accepting them, I fear them and am obsessed with them. I find it impossible to focus on anything else. Prior the surgery I found negative visualization a very powerful technique for relief and gratitude but now it only feeds the fears and suffering. Weird.

I have read a bunch of posts here on health, aging, and death, but I felt like reaching out nevertheless. Does someone wiser here have any perspective to offer me on this situation?",Stoicism,1703846640.0,t3_18tkdef,0.73,8
"Recently started studying stoicism, what direction to go for better emotional control over things I cannot change?","A little background, most of my life I’ve been extremely stoic without even knowing what it was. Until I was 26, I would even say it was bordering on pathological and uncaring. I went in the military after high school and had never found anything emotionally difficult in my life, be that deaths of family or friends or anything else. I felt nothing, no honor, pride, or anything, even regarding my time in the military. Everyone would tell me how weird that is to not be proud and I never really understood that until now. 

At 26, my life took an extremely sudden turn. Following the break up with the only woman I had ever loved, suddenly, and if by magical intervention, I began experiencing emotion on a level I failed to control or understand. The first six months were absolutely horrible but since then I’ve been able to for the most part control it. But it has been an incredibly weird and interesting learning curve. Even though I broke up with her a year and a half ago, I am still vastly more emotional than I have been at any point in my life prior. Everything from movies to friendships to failure with women, etc., has caused some kind of emotional response whether it is something I can control or not. 

The last six months I’ve been back in the gym, picked up boxing, and studying/reading about a lot of topics. Just generally continuing my self improvement. Once again I have found myself upset at something I can no longer control. I finally set up a date to ask a woman out who I have known for over a year, just for that very same day to be the day she told me she is finally in a relationship again. There’s nothing I can do now, I missed my chance and anything other than supporting her would be wrong. 

This has prompted me to look into and begin studying stoicism. I dusted off a book a friend gave me several months ago called How to Be a Stoic: Using Ancient Philosophy to Live a Modern Life. I have been reading and taking notes. So far I have been extremely pleased with this ideology. I honestly think this is my solution and my framework for learning how to channel my old stoic behavior towards things of which I have no control while maintaining this newfound emotion for things in my control.

I’d greatly appreciate any help pointing me in the right direction regarding authors, books to read next, or any stoic philosophers that come to mind in my situation. I am very excited and hopeful that stoicism will help me reach what I am beginning to expect it can. Stoicism just seems like the perfect framework for balancing out my life. 

TLDR- For most of my life I was very stoic until a break up caused me to become quite emotional. After studying stoicism the little I have, I believe it can help me channel my stoic nature towards things changeable and my newfound emotion towards things I can change.",Stoicism,1703817065.0,t3_18tbvhg,0.85,17
Diversity of thought in Stoicsm,"I would love to hear everyone’s take on a few related questions:

1. Diversity in early Stoicism: Do you think there was greater diversity of thought among the early Stoic philosophers compared to modern interpretations? 

2. Influence of surviving texts: Considering we learn about Stoicism through the few texts that have survived, to what extent do you believe our understanding is shaped, or perhaps limited, by this? Even among these sources aren’t there differences and contradictions?

3. Embracing diversity of opinion today: Given the potential variations in early Stoic thought, could we be more open to diverse interpretations of Stoicism in our community?",Stoicism,1703855247.0,t3_18tmqxv,0.75,2
Dreading the dawn of a new year and beyond it,"Some of you might be thinking, aren't t people supposed to be happy and feeling fresh for a new year. Well not so much for me. I'm a teenager. I got to put up with harder subjects, difficult teachers, in a new environment because of changing classes and having to put up with my family's reprimands or strict ideals. I know this might all sound minor.

But to top it off, I've experienced possibly the most gruelling period of my life I had ever faced. You might want to read my posts back in around April-July this year. Assuming that you've read my posts, I have developed a trauma towards the whole experience. I do not want to degrade others with much worse traumatic experiences. I'm afraid that next year I will have another ""gruelling period of my life"". Now the one back in April-July left me traumatised, so it makes the fear much more scarier. I'm not traumatized by the event itself, but the process of overcoming it. I went through a lot of struggle just to cope and overcome. And it was so arduous to go through that now I am intensely afraid of experiencing that same pain and struggle of overcoming another occurrence. Sometimes when I come across scenarios where the atmosphere feels similar to one of the situations back then, I would actually start to become self-conscious and panic. I would physically feel my heart starting to feel uncomfortable. Again, from an external view, this might seem a bit minor but for me it was definitely damaging so bear with me.

A part of me knows going through it is necessary for growth and learning. Since it was exactly that period of April-July that forced me to find something to help cope with things, that being finding Stoicism. Any similar hurdles in the future may also present the same kind of opportunities. 

But I can't help but worry and fear that similar things will occur in the next few years of my life. Just imagining having to go through so much of that same traumatic struggle. And this trauma causes the fear of suffering to overpower the fear of remaining static or the lack of growth. I also can't help but worry about the far future of my life as a whole and all the difficult things I need to deal with along the way. But I'll assume I won't live that long, and even telling myself this isn't enough (I am not suicidal by any means).

I'm aware that there are many stoic doctrines that can help with my situation or that this anxiety is just fleeting and should just live with it. But despite that I still can't help but worry. And I'm really starting to lose my ground to the present. It just keeps occupying my mind full of these scary images. And I don't have the time or privacy to randomly close my eyes and spend 5 or 10 minutes to mentally rehearse all my approaches(that's how I personally do it). Any advice from fellow stoic practitioners is much appreciated. It's also best if your response can be concentrated on all the aspects I've mentioned and thank you for understanding.🙏",Stoicism,1703836499.0,t3_18thtux,0.83,4

Is there any semblance of a Path offered in Stoicism?,"I was having a discussion with a friend of mine on the differences between Buddhism and Stoicism.

In many Buddhist traditions, there is a clear path to follow towards an enlightened state of mind. E.g., Lam Rim in Tibetan Buddhism. This path involves a defined set of practices to follow that are graduated according to different capabilities. Meditation is the core daily practice in the path.

By following a path, I mean following practices hat are different than simply acting as if one was in the end state already (acting in an enlightened way). For example, in Buddhism, there are practices of focusing on the breath or another meditation object; also practices of doing body scans of various parts of the body. This has little to do with enlightenment itself, but is more about training the mind in ways that are conducive for enlightenment.

In Stoicism, we hear of the most ideal ways to act in multiple life situations, but are there any paths or practices offered by the philosophers to work towards making those ideal ways to act come spontaneously (vs. just trying to act in a stoically correct way as much as possible from the beginning)?

I'm not sure what the right phrase is like comfort zone, change, responsibilities, take life serious, take actions.

I'm reflecting so much right to a point Im feeling overwhelmed and emotionally mentally exhausted. I realize my mistake and I don't blame nobody but me. I knew I was suppose to not let failures stop me but for years I just accepted it and live in this passive life mindset. I didn't have the guts or courage to stand up and make a change. I'm already in mid-20s but barely have any work experience besides fast food and retail store aka people call dead end jobs. My age group people have already some finished college, working in desired field jobs, in a relationship, overcoming fears, living in the adulthood independent life instead of staying with parents. Meanwhile I ask myself like what am I doing and when is my time gonna come in life. For how long am I gonna sit home scrolling phone and avoiding life. Sooner or later life is gonna slap me yet I'm already feeling all this all but I'm just not understanding why am I not taking action.

Following my passion or following what my parents think is best for me.,"I (M,23, working class) hardly go out, I study at college (it's free here) and live in a developing country. I have friendships that are not really friendships since I hardly interact with them and I don’t have much in common, in reality I just have two true friends which I see seldom. My mother (F,41) says that I need to get out of my shell, wake up, go out more and I just realized that what I really like is art, which is a great coincidence; however, I am very clear that I want to dedicate myself to art and design, after drawing since childhood and coming up with stories, ideas and new narratives since childhood also and being part of an NGO and doing great things for the Marketing Department. I also decided I could look for groups with interests similar to mine. My mother, however, tells me that I have to look for other environments besides the one I want, to see how the real world is, and that I have to open up to other environments and that she can accommodate me in a job with my father where I can learn how to relate to other people, but that is not what I want at all, because I feel that I would be betraying myself and my ideals if I take that job. She is also looking for opportunities for me within her job, and says that I have to open up or else, I will be lost for many years like my father (M,41), who has been in the limbo of jobs he didn't like until he found a stable job (although, my father always wanted to be a full-time musician but wanted to find other jobs out of necessity cause he had a child, me, even though there were lots of opportunities as a musician). I have also worked for a Google Partner agency for some months but they fired me cause I couldn't meet the KPIs, and honestly, I didn't like that job and also had school and my volunteering at the NGO. That is my problem, choosing between dedicating myself to what I like fully or doing other things and leaving art and design as a hobby. As additional information, I have gone through diagnosed Generalized Anxiety which was crippling at the beginning but that over time it has lost power, and really in social environments I have trouble staying focused and I tend to be extroverted in some situations but according to my mother I do things that are not relevant or that are not socially acceptable (basically I lack social skills and everyone can step on me, as she says), such as asking an Uber driver politely if he can change the music being someone I just met today, or asking them (my parents) what they are talking about when I get to the table with them, that according to her. She also told me that I have to adapt to this society that is very superficial, in this developing Latin American country, since she lived it that way. Basically image sells way better than intelligence and competence, and she is saying about my attire and that I need to dress better, to which I agree. What can I do about it? What would be your advice? I understand that she wants the best for me and cares for me considering the situation in which we live in, but I just took a path I realized I didn't want once with my first degree, and lived in fear and pending for other people's approval for way too long (to which my mother disapproves because she says that if that was the case, I would be working on myself already).

About things you cannot control,"I am new to this. What i understand is stoicism focuses on things you have control on, how to control things you can control. By default, humans are bad about distinguishing what they are in control of, and what they are not, and they are bad about actually controlling things they can control.

However, does stoicism promise to completely let go of things you cannot control, no matter how grim, exhausting and horrible they are? In the sub i noticed a frequent answer of ""Do you have control on it? If not, just go and focus on things you have control on"".

 To me its not realistic, to just not care and not be bothered by things you dont have control on. Similiar to be a buddist monk, to let go of earthly desires etc. Those who actually achieve that are born in temple culture and has no metropolian city problems in the first place. 

Maybe you can be bothered less, maybe you realize they are not that important to be bothered so much and let go, but can a hypotetical person John, who is cancer, is 4'5'' height adult male and in a third world country with a very toxic family, with no way out of his house, achieve to be not bothered by all this?

Thinking less extreme, i see its completely normal to be bothered by being unattractive for example. It is objectively hurting your social status especially dating. Maybe you are not absolutely doomed, but to simply say ""just focus on things you have control on"" sounds a shitty advice to be honest. ",Stoicism,1703760742.0,t3_18sr89r,0.77,7

December’s Trials,"The month of December’s been a real test. In order of sequence.

* Mass Layoffs in my organization. I was forced to lay off 12 people on my team. About 70%.
* My cat of 12 years was diagnosed with lymphatic cancer. He died two weeks later in my arms when we euthanized him while he was starting to have congestive heart failure.
* We got a call my wife’s father was going to pass. Got on a 5 hour flight to a different country the next morning. He died 3 days later when we were in the room. Difficult scenario. Multiple religions. Multiple cultures. His burial wishes were odds with the family. I had to mediate between passionate people.
* Got a respiratory illness on the plane there, kicked into full gear by the time I flew back.
* Multiple hour plane delays.
* By Christmas Eve I got gastritis. Recovering now.

I had Stoicism by my side throughout. Quick reminders to calibrate me at the thousand moments throughout it all.

When my cat passed, I remember feeling grateful to have premeditated on this event for many years, never having lost an opportunity to enjoy him. Taking comfort in knowing I did my best to save him. And helped his passing when nothing else could. I’ll miss that little guy. But he’s been restored now.

When I was mediating a difficult family situation I anchored everything around what my proper role was in this family as a husband of a wife. A son-in-law. A guest.

When I got sick I recall being grateful for an opportunity to be reminded how nice it was to be absent of symptoms. There was one day I had a 7 hour migraine, pain piercing through all thoughts except a thought that I desired for things to be exactly as they were.

There were a thousand moments for Stoicism. A thousand reflections. It saved me from so many passions. But I won’t lie to you and pretend I was free from them.

When my cat passed, I was angry at the universe for about a day. In temporary disbelief, even though I witnessed his passing with my own eyes. I was inconsolable.

Now that I’m through it all. I have to admit I am exhausted. I would even go as far as saying I feel depressed. Like missing joi de vivre. Like the world lost some saturation in its colour. I cannot diagnose the cause for this, so I am giving it some time.

We go through these things because we have to. The only choice we have is in how we choose to take it on.

I recall Zeno’s story of the dog and the cart. I recall Marcus talking about what bearable pain is. I recall Epictetus and his many lessons about loss and one’s proper role. And envisioning how you’d like to maintain your character in adversity. I recall many of the people of this community, their insights and advice to others.

Looking for the source of a quote by Marcus Aurelius,"I'm looking for the source of a quote about criticism. I believe its from Marcus Aurelius but I can't find it. I googled and found a reference to it here:

>""As Marcus Aurelius writes, if that criticism is correct and we are in error then the person criticizing us has done us a favor by correcting it. If they are wrong, what do we care? More likely, if we are doing our job right, we should already be well aware of the issue that people are raising and already be fixing it.""

EDIT: Please... this is about the correct source of the quote and not about Ryan Holiday. IMHO quotes without specifying the source of the quotes are almost worthless because then you can't check the context of the quote.

But so far I was unable to locate this in the Meditations. I did find Meditations 5.3 which is similar but not the same:

>\[3\] Judge yourself entitled to say or do anything that’s in accord with nature, and don’t let yourself be talked out of it by any criticism or argument that may follow as a consequence. If it was the right thing to do or say, don’t put yourself down. Other people have their own command centers and their own impulses, and you shouldn’t let your attention be caught by them, but carry straight on,6 following your own nature and universal nature, two things that share a single path.

Epictetus Encheiridion 42 is similar:

>42. When someone acts badly towards you, or speaks badly of you, remember that he is acting or speaking in that way because he regards that as being the proper thing for him to do. Now, it isn’t possible for him to act in accordance with what seems right to you, but only with what seems right to him. So if he judges wrongly, he is the one who suffers the harm, since he is the one who has been deceived. For if anyone should think a true composite judgement\* to be false, the judgement itself isn’t harmed, but the person who has been deceived. If you start out, then, from this way of thinking, you’ll be gentle with someone who abuses you, for in each case you’ll say, ‘That is how it seemed to him.’

Can somebody please give me the source of the Marcus Aurelius quote (Meditations book/chapter) ? I don't want to use this like 'Somewhere in the internet I found that Ryan Holiday said that Marcus Aurelius said that,,,""

"Breaking the cycle, how?","Hey fellow stoics, I have some questions that I like to gain some insight in. Also, sorry for using a throwaway.

Some background about me. I have what I would consider a successful and fulfilled life. On the other hand I have always dealt with some mild level of anxiety, depression, perfectionism and self doubt. Not exactly to the point where I consider this clinically relevant but it's still annoying and probably the root cause of some of the issues I dealt with for years (if this is relevant I can go into details at a later point).
I have some formal (university level) training in philosophy and stumbled on stoicism a couple of years ago. I read Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and a couple of others.

So here is the issue: on a rational level all of stoicism makes perfect sense to me. I can subscribe to almost all if not all of the points, BUT... I feel like I struggle big time applying them to everyday life. How much varies by occasion but in general I blame this to my latent anxiety issues. I want to give two examples:

I have a rather annoying and difficult neighbour. This person is for some reasons, which I can partly empathize with (although I'm legally and morally in the right), angry at me and tries to make my life harder. To this date almost all of the stuff are minor incursions, making noise, minor insults, throwing rubbish over the fence in my garden now and then. Rationally I know perfectly well that I should ignore him, that I should just continue to live my life. This situation continues for half a year now and the agressions Come in waves. Whenever there is a new set I'm losing my composure and start spiraling into a fear hate anxiety thought spiral which wrecks my whole day. When I try to rationalise this there are still the physiological symptoms, heart beating, muscle tension etc. This immediately pulls me back.

Second example are certain interactions with my son. There are certain instances where his behaviour is triggering my rage and this is 100% out of that I love him and see that a certain behaviour in his future will probably hurt him and so I have to somehow deal with this. Whenever I throw a fit I immediately regret it because I realise how irrational this is. Also there mostly the physiological reactions suck me completely in and my rational brain shuts off.

Those are but two examples where I have a huge cognitive dissonance between how I know I should act correctly and how I actually react.

I'm insecure about my height,"I'm precisely 5'0"" and I'm fifteen years old. I was one of the taller kids in my class when I was 9–12 years old, so I wasn't too concerned about my height then. However, now that I'm in high school, I'm the shortest guy in our class, which makes me really insecure about my height.

How to best practice stoic values?,"In particular I’m having trouble letting go of that which I cannot control.

I had what I deemed the perfect life about a year ago.  I’d worked decades for it.  A turn of futures changed that early this year.

I’ve been doing therapy and reading a ton to try to overcome the trauma the change caused.  Yet it remains quite challenging for me to simply practice radical acceptance and be “happy” again with significantly less.

To elaborate, a year ago I was about to marry the love of my life with whom I was looking forward to starting a family shortly thereafter.  I’m 36 now.  We broke up in January over a personal tragedy of mine.  Now not only do I still have that personal tragedy to live with the rest of my life; I lost the woman I wanted to build a life with.  The personal tragedy left me with fewer prospects at a time in my life when I had already started feeling the pressure to start a family.

Struggling to radically accept my tragedy and my diminished prospects.  Even if rationally I can see that I have no control over the past and only reaction to it, I still struggle to no get down a year into it.

Thanks so much.  I’ve studied the stoics but perhaps need to do so more daily until it sticks?  Anything else effective people have tried?",Stoicism,1703756236.0,t3_18sq33c,0.56,1

Struggling to balance the teachings of stoicism with other conflicting philosophies,"I (19M) recently got into stoicism this last summer, as the teachings of self control and freeing oneself of anxiety deeply resonated with me. Marcus’ Meditations was actually the first book I’ve completed out of my own interest, rather than being forced to read by a school curriculum. I began to implement many of the stoic teachings into my life and found mostly positive results.

However, recently I’ve started to get into conflicting philosophies, such as Machiavellianism and I have picked up books like Robert Greene’s 48 Laws of Power to supplement this interest. Through reading works like the 48 Laws of power, I came to a realization that it is nearly impossible to balance these 2 differing ideologies at once. Both these ways of thinking resonate with me in different ways, both being equally compelling.

Against Nature as Grounds for Compassion,"*  Musonius Rufus, like the other Stoics, advocated love for our fellow man. So then, what justification does Rufus give for compassion? He argues that compassion is in accordance with human nature. He justifies this by pointing to what we can observe in both human beings and bees, with both species cooperating with their own.
* My problem with this is that all kinds of things we would consider evil, such as rape and murder, are also part of human nature. Does that mean we must do those things too?
* Rufus would, I believe based on certain passages, counter this by saying things like rape and murder are hated and punished in all societies, at least within the boundaries of said societies (native American tribes would have no qualms about hurting members of other groups).
* The problem would be that this is a justification based on social consensus. It would be essentially saying ""Society approves it, therefore it is right"". And yet, there are things that societies past and present have approved of that are obviously immoral. Child sacrifice, female genital mutilation and ritual animal torture are things that have been or still are practiced and approved of under social consensus, and the reader of this message would most likely reject them with vehemence.
* Therefore we must conclude that nature, whether it be the nature of individual humans or the nature of society, is no grounds for compassion. ",Stoicism,1703699673.0,t3_18s6mnh,0.67,1
Emotional Repression w/Misapplication of Stoicism,"
u/SimonDK1994 brought up a very good point to my previous post: 

1.	⁠Make **S**ure to acknowledge your feel**i** n **g**s. People trying to practice stoicis**m** tend to surpress feelings before they learn th**a**t they should actually acknowledge them more and THEN deal with them rationally. This can lead to pinned up emotions and at some point send their world crashing down.(Ask me how i know)

I have been reflecting on it a lot more, and realize that I’ve actually been repre**s**sing my emotions *a lot* more than I thought. So I did more studying, and I’ve concluded the following: 

If there is a situation that ruffles me up, such as the train being delayed, I feel inpatient and angry. Because I’m trying to practice Stoicism, I usually would remind myself “Be calm, there’s nothing to be angry about.” This never actually wor**k**ed as **i** would *pretend* that I’m calm and **b** el **i**eve I was succee**di**ng, but inside I was reaching my boiling point. The issue here is that emotions are dependent variables, so we cannot simply say “Don’t be angry, there’s nothing to be angry about” as the anger has already been produced. If I want to not be angry, the anger has to genuinely not come in the first place. If it does, that is when we should reason to attempt calm ourselves down, not to pretend that we can just will our emotions away. Wait, is that what Epictetus meant when he said, 

“*For this reason also it is ridiculous to say, “Suggest something to me.” What should I suggest to you? “Well, form my mind so as to accommodate itself to any event.” Why that is just the same as if a man who is ignorant of letters should say, “Tell me what to write when any name is proposed to me.” For if I should tell him how to write Dion, and then another should come and propose to him not the name of Dion but that of Theon, what will be done? What will he write? But if you have practiced writing, you are also prepared to write anything that is required. If you are not, what can I now suggest? For if circumstances require something else, what will you say, or what will you do? Remember then this general precept and you will need no suggestion. But if you gape after externals, you must of necessity ramble up and down in obedience to the will of your master. And who is the master? He who has the power over the things which you seek to gain or try to avoid.*” - Discourse 2.2 “Of Tranquility from Pertubation”

If we injured our leg, it has already been injured, so just telling yourself to calm down is like telling someone to “just walk” on their injured leg.

So then we need to focus on the independent variable(s). Would that be our impressions? ",Stoicism,1703661595.0,t3_18rutqx,0.82,7

Life not going my way. People talking badly about me. How do I handle it?," 

Hello!

To give some context, I'm a medical student. I'm quite poor and racking up student loans, but I chose not to get a job because I cannot handle my school workload along with work. I have to say a lot of these medical students are quite wealthy, well connected and are related to doctors who can help them learn, show them resources and etc. I don't have any of that. I came from a poor immigrant family. I got discriminated by ethnicity and wealth. Now in med school, I'm somewhat struggling, not failing but not in a comfortable position in terms of grades and skills. Unbeknownst to some people med students can be some of the most toxic people you'll meet: Hypercompetitive, back stabbing, fake and etc. They constantly lie that their skills and grades and purely out of their natural intellect instead of admitting their connections and money helped (Some of my classmates will voluntarily say that they read the textbook but I later found out they don't and used outside studying material or they got jobs in the hospitals because their parents worked there and had connections, but refuse to acknowledge that; there was a pattern I noticed. In my city, it's currently hard to find a job right now and when I applied in the summer none hired me. The only classmates I knew who got hired were the ones who admitted their parents worked in the hospital.

Some of my classmates have been talking badly about me. Some of them have slandered me. I also have to fund my parent's retirement because they didn't save enough. At this point in life I kinda want to give up. I am disadvantaged, my classmates and even some of the unit nurses have talked badly about me.

Best book / text that talks about indifference,"Hi there, 

I have very little exposure to Stoicism, knowing only the basics. I have pretty sever OCD and intrusive thoughts and I have tried to deal with them through meds and talking therapy. I feel like I know the origins of my thoughts and the core beliefs from which they stem. I can also manage to gain some composure and control over my compulsions. 

However, I am trying to get to the place of indifference to my thoughts/fears. I have been single for 10 years because every time I start to date and get close with someone the fears of loss and abandonment start, and then its often been a fulfilling prophecy. I would like to become indifferent to this, 

Are there any specific books/stoic philosophers that might be helpful for me to read, to learn how to get into this practice? I am aware that suppression is not going to help  and that we can confuse suppression with indifference if we are not careful!

How would you proceed in my situation from a stoic point of view? Advice for dealing with a flaky friend,"A friend I considered close has disappointed me and out of curiosity I would like to hear how others may choose to act in this situation (from a stoic point of view).

A month ago I had a low point and messaged my friend if she could call me whenever she was free. No response.

A month passes and she completely ignores the message. I know she'd been out partying etc. At the very least she could've messaged me just to let me know she's a little busy and will catch up when she's available etc. out of respect. 

Additionally, I usually spend Christmas with her family because I'm in a foreign country and I've gotten close with them; they are always so caring and kind to me. Before this silent month, she had mentioned the invite from her parents again. But since ignoring my message she also never followed up on that invite or bothered checking on my Christmas plans etc. I also did not feel comfortable reaching out to inquire about coming over for Christmas since she hasn't even had the courtesy to open my message. 

Finally I receive a lame message from her on the 23rd about how she apparently didn't notice my message and that she's been busy working and fell ill on the week etc. 

I love her but I know she has tendencies to be...entitled and kind of unreliable. Not only with me but that's her core personality. She does what feels best to herself in the moment dealing with the consequences later. There's also been one other ongoing issue (nothing too serious but still enough for me to get annoyed and insecure) that I've tried to communicate to her but her behavior has not changed and I'm not sure I'm comfortable tolerating it anymore. 

I haven't bothered to respond to her message yet. I considered just ghosting her myself snd not talking to her again. Is that a bit too strong a reaction?",Stoicism,1703551315.0,t3_18qvdts,0.61,2

Acceptance being key to every problem!!,"As title says, i oftentimes think that the world around me is far prettier and interesting place, quite contrary to what i have felt and what kind of images i made in my mind. In my case, most of the obstacles in my life are created by none other than me. So it's obvious that i wasn't able to find a subject to direct my frustration to. After a long series of repentance and self-growth and a huge amount of increase in self-esteem, i have come to this conclusion that the problem in my life is me only, by improving myself over time, and accepting my situation more rather than running away from it or ignoring it, just worked. It's not like all my issues has faded away, but at some extent, i feel pretty good.
Being a loner and immense craving of wanting to talk to someone and share feelings with, it was a lot of toll on me. So i just want to stop expecting any external assistance (A bare minimun socialising is necessary too).

"""The beginning of philosophy ... is an awareness of one’s own weakness and incapacity when it comes to the most important things."" -- Epictetus","Kind of going back to basics on this one (from Discourses 2.11).  Came across this as I was reflecting on my struggles with letting go of past mistakes. 

Had a realization that it boiled down to my own arrogance as I looked back on my life.  I was holding my younger self to an unrealistic standard of perfection, that I *should* have thought and acted a certain way (given what I know now).  

Once I started accepting my own flawed nature as a typical human being, I could look back upon my earlier failures with more compassion and forgiveness.  With this came welcome sense of peace and relief.

As Ward Farnsworth puts it in The Practicing Stoic:

*Stoicism, as we have seen at many points, is a humble philosophy. It starts with candid assessment of one’s own flaws and foolishness. As the Stoic sees it, a confession of weakness is not weakness; it is the way to wisdom.*",Stoicism,1703453242.0,t3_18q4a2h,0.96,25

How would a stoic react to bullying?,"

Just graduated from high school, but the entirety of my last semester was spent being gaslit and bullied by one of the school’s favorite students. They promoted her as the most perfect person in the school so I felt like there was an ideal I could never measure up to as a boy, meanwhile she constantly mocked and belittled all of the boys in our class including me, but when I tried to tell the teachers about it she targeted me specifically.  She gaslit me into thinking I was some kind of monster she couldn’t feel safe around and I was scared to go into school most of the time. When I tried to talk to her about it, still thinking she was a good person, she got the teachers to shut me down entirely. Now I was not only being manipulated and bullied, but I couldn’t defend myself. Meanwhile the school, a Christian school btw, promoted her as the most perfect and Christ like student. She was one of their best athletes as well. The teachers refused to do anything about her and I ended up in some pretty disturbing patterns including potential suicide. I eventually came to find out that she was bullying everyone else too, but it was all completely permissible by the school. I don’t know what to make of my faith as a whole if that is what Christianity looks like. I’ve been in therapy for the past several months and I’ve been out of school entirely since may, but she is living in my head rent free and she will not leave.

"Question for veterans and seasoned stoics.

The basics are there, but I'd like to ask the veterans of this philosophy a few things. What part of Stoicism is ignored in its most commercial version? Is there any aspect of Stoicism that has been given more importance than it should? Is there any concept that has been distorted?

For example, I understand that Stoicism also dealt with metaphysical issues. This is not something that is mentioned frequently.

Applying principles in day to day life,"Hello, folks.

I have read about Stoicism for some time now, and am slowly but surely making my way through a number of books. My initial introduction was quite by accident when I encountered Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. This has also led me to read Letters from a Stoic - Seneca (I am not finished), and some of Epictetus (Discourse and selected writings. Translation,etc...by Robert Dobbin)

So much of this seems to make sense to me and I think there is real value in this philosophy. However, being so new to this, I am having difficulty in translating philosophy to concrete actions that I can take.  Amongst the most simplistic, but incredibly difficult for me to do is changing my mindset. For example, Epictetus states, “Man is disturbed not by things, but by the views he takes of them.”,and Marcus Aurelius states writes, ""Do not waste time on what you cannot control.”

What are concrete steps one can take in this direction? 

I have read the [Advice and Coping With Problems Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/wiki/advice/#wiki_advice_and_coping_with_problems), and again this makes sense when Epictetus wrote in Discourses that this takes time. (In answer to a man wanting a fig.) ""Let the tree blossom first, then put forth its fruit, and finally let the fruit ripen. Now although the fruit of even a fig-tree is not brought to perfection all at once and in a single hour, would you still seek to secure the fruit of a man's mind in so short a while and so easily?""

How does one even plant the seed of fig tree to begin with? 

* Are there concrete steps that one can take to plant the seed? 
* Once this seed is planted, are there concrete steps that one can take to build the mindset to manage how one views things?

Thank you for your advice and allowing me a moment of your valuable time!

A Stoic approach to dealing with a parent who has early-alzheimer's disease?,"I'm 19 years old and my mom has early-onset alzheimer's disease. She was diagnosed at only 50. It's not been easy at all.

I wouldn't say I'm new to stoicism, I've read Meditations, Discourses, and Letters from a Stoic. I've been interested and learning about it for a few years now, since before my mom's diagnosis. The issue is that learning about it and applying it are two very different beasts, which I'm sure you all know.

It's silly, but for some reason I feel like this is a true stoic ""test"" for me: facing an insurmountable tragedy I have no way of helping.

How do I navigate the future? I understand that this is something I have no power over; it is completely out of my control. But how do I actually *apply* that to myself? When I first started learning about stoicism, it was relatively straightforward to internalize because I wasn't facing something like this. But now that I am... I'm realizing just how difficult this philosophy really is to apply when tragedy strikes.

Senecas view on frequent travel,"Hi everyone! I just started reading ""Letters from a Stoic"" by Seneca. In Letter II of the book, Seneca states the following:  
""To be everywhere is to be nowhere. People who spend their whole life travelling abroad end up having plenty of places where they can find hospitality but not real friendships"".

I wanted to pose an argument to this statement. I am hoping to have others chime in with their own view / a response that may have been expected from a person like Seneca:  


Is it necessary to be somewhere? I argue that the brief and admittedly capricious interactions with other travellers and locals often exceeds the knowledge and wisdom that is to be gained at home. If I prioritised a friendship at home at the expense of gaining new cultural perspectives or wisdom from people I meet abroad, would I not be prioritising a passion over wisdom? Could the desire to form friendships not be interpreted as exactly that, a passion? Wisdom is a virtue part of the true good. Would it not by necessity be more valuable to seek out wisdom that is not otherwise to be gained at home, at the expense of lasting friendships? Sure, wisdom and new cultural experiences can be gained at home, but there is an air of complacency with lasting friendships that do not stimulate new perspectives the same way that frequent travel abroad does.   


I would love to hear your opinion and perspective! I would love to be made aware if I have misinterpreted something as well. Thanks!",Stoicism,1703387116.0,t3_18pm0fq,0.65,5
Finding meaning in life,"Stoicism has already helped me in becoming a better person. I can focus better on my studies, I go to the gym regularly now. When I have a hard time getting out of bed, I think about, what Marcus Aurelius said in Meditations:

>>At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: “I have to go to work — as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for — the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?”
So you were born to feel “nice”? Instead of doing things and experiencing them? Don’t you see the plants, the birds, the ants and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks, putting the world in order, as best they can? And you’re not willing to do your job as a human being? Why aren’t you running to do what your nature demands?
You don’t love yourself enough. Or you’d love your nature too, and what it demands of you.<<

But right now, I really struggle with finding any meaning in life. I feel depressed almost every evening because I'm thinking ""What am I doing all this for?"" The problem is that I've always found meaning in a partner. And now that I've been single for a while I'm finally wondering what else there is to live for.

How Stoicism is helping me stay alive (from suicidal ideation),"Even if I can never truly be considered a Stoic, I am determined to try my best to become as close as I can to it. For some quick background; I’ve grown up in poverty, suffered years as a child through sexual abuse, I’ve attempted suicide near the beginning of the year and have been admitted to the mental hospital 4 times this year, lost my job, evicted, cheated on (after 4.5 years) - ending my first relationship, lost all of my friends, kicked out of college etc. I am not attempting to elicit sympathy. I see suicide brought up quite often in the subreddit, so I am trying to offer my assistance. As of such, please correct me if I am misapplying and/or misinterpreting any of the ideas. 

**1. Virtue: COURAGE**
Life is feeling quite uncomfortable at the moment; Just as I believe it can’t get any worse, it just keeps throwing more and more surprises my way. Although I am working to *change* my outlook on life, my current belief is that life will not get better and I will just experience more suffering. I *suppose* that this isn’t true, but I genuinely do not believe its falsehood - **yet**. By practicing the virtue of courage I am accepting that fact and living *in spite* of that belief. As corny as it sounds: it takes courage to live. Courage is not living in the absence of fear, but to live *despite* those fears and discomforts. 

Another aspect of courage is *actually seeking professional help*, and having the courage to put my faith in these professionals’ hands. It was hard as I had ZERO faith that it would work, but lemme tell ya, **it’s working**. 

**2. Epictetus, Discourse 1.18 “That we ought not to be angry with the errors (faults) of others”**

 “*Learn that a thief and an adulterer have no place in the things which are yours, but in those which belong to others and which are not in your power. If you dismiss these things and consider them as nothing, with whom are you still angry? But so long as you value these things, be angry with yourself rather than with the thief and the adulterer.*” 

I use this concept to cope with 1: The infidelity and 2: The years of sexual abuse I’ve been through. Regarding the infidelity, their loyalty is exactly that: *their* loyalty, meaning it is theirs to give and theirs to take back whenever they please. Even if they agreed to give it to me, nothing hinders them from betraying that agreement. In this case, they have chosen to take it back, and therefore have communicated this to me through their actions. At that point, it’s up to me to decide how I respond to what they’ve communicated - we are no longer together. The decision to end it is not about hating or resenting them. If the only thing in my power is the right use of appearances, then I’ve concluded the following: It’s because I want loyalty. They’ve proven to be an unreliable source for that, and therefore it would be senseless to desire something from someone that they’ve *proven* to be unable to provide. 

**3. Epictetus as an example**
I mean come on, Epictetus has been through some awful ass shit. He is an amazing example of Stoicism at work. I have trouble following advice if the person giving the advice *only* knows the answers through theory as opposed to practical application. Epictetus completely blows that out of the water for me. If HE can do it, surely I can. 

**4. Epictetus, Discourse 1.24 “How we should struggle with circumstances”** in combination with **Discourse 1.5 “Against the Academics”**

“*It is circumstances (difficulties) which show what men are. Therefore when a difficulty falls upon you, remember that God, like a trainer of wrestlers, has matched you with a rough young man. “For what purpose?” You may say. Why, that you may become an Olympic conquerer; but it is not accomplished without sweat.*” 

“*But, you may say, there are some things disagreeable and troublesome in life. And are there none at Olympia? Are you not without comfortable means of bathing? Are you not wet when it rains? Have you not abundance of noise, clamour, and other disagreeable things? But I suppose that setting all these things off against the magnificence of the spectacle, you bear and endure. Well then and have you not received faculties by which you will be able to bear all that happens? Have you not received greatness of the soul? Have you not received manliness? Have you not received endurance? And why do I trouble myself about anything that can happen if I possess greatness of the soul? What shall distract my mind or disturb me, or appear painful? Shall I not use the power for the purposes for which I received it, and shall I grieve and lament over what happens?*” 

I have been given the faculties to deal with everything that has happened to me and everything that *can* happen to me. With that in mind, I have the knowledge that by using such faculties I am making them stronger and therefore becoming stronger myself. This, if anything, takes me RIGHT out of my suicidal episodes. Yes, the things that have happened may seem horrible, but I’ve *endured* them and grown from them. It’s like; yeah, that’s a big ass mountain, but I **climbed** that big ass mountain. THAT is what’s important. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHJHHH",Stoicism,1703303940.0,t3_18ox2tm,0.9,42

Mindfulness for War Refugees / Survivors,"Hey everyone, I'm a war survivor in my mid-twenties who've found refuge in a neighboring country. The war in my home country is still ongoing and it's getting worse by the minute. During these times I struggle to pull myself away from this very intense human experience. Can't help but think about everything I lost back home and the devastating news on the daily. I'm thankful for the safety of my family and the very fact that I have a job that allows me to provide for them despite the looming reality that I'll probably be a slave to it for the rest of my life and as a stranger. This is my very first time sharing all of this into existence, and I know that human suffering can be found everywhere around the globe. 

&#x200B;

Was wondering if anyone has been through a similar experience or have any advice/quotes or anything that helped them stay afloat during such dark times.

Does anyone else get massively dissapointed in themselves when they react based off emotion? How do you deal with that?,"Hi everyone,

How do you guys deal with reacting based off emotion?

 Lately I have been having kinda shitty days (I know this isnt an excuse) and I just sometimes do things that I very am dissapointed in.

For example just today when I was cycling back from the gym I see a family standing in the middle of the cycling lane like dumbasses. Now here's the bit im dissapointed in,  I gave the guy (I assume the dad) kinda like a death stare. Not a massive big deal I know but still.

What good does that do? Nothing. Will that prevent them from doing that again? Probably not. Will I get my ass beat if I do that to the wrong guy? Possibly. Maybe they didnt even know that they were on a cycling lane.  I immidietly after that was so dissapointed in myself. Like dude are you a baby?

I know that I am in control of my own actions/reactions. I cant control what others do or say. Some people are just not very thoughtful,(?) of others. Not everyone has the same norms and values. Maybe they were even new to the country and dont even know how the traffic rules work. I should pity them and not react in a hateful manner. But sometimes its just so grrrr, you know?

How do you guys ""catch"" yourself before reacting? I always have the stoic mindset after the fact.",Stoicism,1703270607.0,t3_18olvqw,0.95,67
Do we have to control the good in us?,"So I just woke up and started thinking about something I said yesterday. I told someone that in every human being there is good and bad and we have to accept the bad in us and learn to control it, so it doesn’t take control over us (as in overtaking us ig).

Now I’m thinking a stoic would probably tell me that we need to control our good too, as moderation is usually key. But then what’s left? Do we need some sort of balance because we can’t let go of our control of the good, because this will ultimately lead to back to the bad (e.g. maximizing joy in the moment, which leads to short term satisfaction but results in long term negative consequences (additional e.g. impulsive, reckless behavior)).

Does it all boil down to gaining as much control over ourselves as we can?

Questions about humanity and passions,"Hello there! Im new here since i just saw Stoicism in school, lol. Now, it was quite an interesting philosophy! I like it :D

But i have some questions:

Mrs Teacher told us that stoics must control their passions and use reason instead, so that way they act in a wise way. Passions arent necesarilly bad, some are good, others bad and other regular. But thats why they need to be kept under control.  If people get carried away by their passions, they dont act in a reasonable way and only cause more damage. I asked Mrs Teacher how much damage, she said ""Greed, war, hatred, etc.""

And i was like HOLY COW. 

1 - Passions really damage so much? The reason of why there is so much hatred, racism, war, greed and more, is because that most humans are passional beings and not rational beings?

2 - Also, how are we supposed to control our passions?

3 - If we somehow made that education promoted reasoning and all humanity became rational instead of passionae, how much better would the world be?

Thanks for reading. Merry christmas! :D",Stoicism,1703348104.0,t3_18p8z5k,0.43,0

My social skills are terrible,"Hello, M17 here. I'm not exactly sure how to begin explaining my situation but i'll give it my best. I've always been a very quiet person, but thing is i don't think i'm a so called ""introvert"". I want to talk to people, i like it, it makes me happy to socialize with friends but the problem is i cant. I don't know how to i guess. I'm scared to talk to strangers, though this has gotten better over the last couple of years after i've convinced myself that not everyone is negatively judging me 24/7, but my stubborness of talking to strangers is somewhat still there. And to get to the main issue, I don't know how to talk, even to people i know! I simply don't know what to say when i'm talking to somone, and so when for example i'm in a group of three, i'll just end up being next to the other two listening what they say and not contributing anything to the conversation. I try to think of something to say but nothing comes out and as i've said before, i simply don't know what to say.
I'm not sure why i'm like this, but my guess is how i grew up perhaps? When i was 4 y/o me and my mom moved to a completely new country. My mother did not know a word on the language. I don't remember much of when i started school, but i do remember i did not have friends, and this was probably in 1st grade. So really i've never had many friends either. Today i only have one truely good friend whom i am able to talk to. But as i've said, when someone else joins us, i am unable to speak, yet my friend has no problems...
I even joined my local volleyball team (because i like the sport) and I would say i'm somewhat friends with like two guys, but even then we don't hang out after practice except video games. I want to be able to join them talk after practice, but i just end up looking at them.
I'm just lost at what i should do, how can i learn to talk?

TL;DR I don't know how to speak, I want to talk but whenever i try, nothing comes out of my mouth and my mind is empty.",Stoicism,1703293175.0,t3_18otskl,0.88,12
I care too much about what others think of me.,"I (19F) have found myself to become increasingly overly concerned with how others perceive me and what their opinions of me are. I don't know how keep these concerns at bay. I am plagued by this fear of others disliking me or talking bad about me behind my back so much that I spend a considerable amount of time thinking about it. I am either thinking about what exactly about my personality is so off-putting or I am thinking about how I can manufacture a false personality to make myself more laid back and appealing.

A week ago, my best friend and his family, both of which I am very close to, invited me over for dinner and this wasn't the first time that this invitation was extended to me. My best friend's brother has a new girlfriend who showed up to this dinner and although me and her had barely exchanged any words beyond a hello, it was disclosed to me that this person does not like me for whatever reason. I am so confused and my mind does cartwheels trying to figure out what I did wrong when I do my best to be personable and kind to those around me. I know this is unhealthy and I shouldn't be so wrapped up in this but I can't help it. I don't know if I even like this person and there's a likely chance my friend's brother and his girlfriend will break up in due time yet I still care too much. Heck, I don't even know when's the next time I will be in the same room as this person.

This little incident is just one example of many where information was revealed to me about or I had found out by myself that a person who I thought I was cool with no longer approves of me and it's always something stupid and simple like people unfollowing me on social media, being quiet and shut down when I enter a room, ex-friends finding excuses to leave me out of plans and hang-outs, etc, etc. I understand to many, I have a strong personality, I have a bit of a potty mouth and my sense of humor is out there but never offensive and I don't let my jokes run wild around people I have just met who might not know better. These thoughts then extend to me feeling like the least favorite of every friend group or just overall an unimpressive and forgettable friend.

How do I let go of these thoughts and this pressure I put on myself to be as likable as possible to everyone I know? I always feel inadequate. I am new to stoicism and would like to put some stoic practices in my day-to-day but I am unsure of what the appropriate  response to all this is as I feel like me getting so wrapped up in my head isn't very ""stoic"".",Stoicism,1703298503.0,t3_18ovhbg,0.83,7

On being content with myself and wanting to improve as a person,"Hello!

Of course I know I have many vices. I can be very impulsive and feel like my emotions control me, although I know both have improved greatly since I have been exposed to stoicism. However, I struggle with my self image and loving myself knowing I have all those flaws.

Created a Self-Study Introductory Course on Stoicism,"I started reading “Daily Stoic” about a year ago, and really enjoy that is is mostly just quotes from original texts of the Stoic Philosophers. I do not really like Ryan Holiday or his anecdotes. Sometimes they are helpful for understanding the passage, but more often than not they seem pointless. So I wanted to read a mix here of modern stoic authors, while also reading some of the  primary texts. I used ChatGPT to come up with parts of this syllabus, but the texts and resources chosen are my own. Is this a good staring point?

Stoics Against Social Isolation,"I would like to discuss the stoic application of social interaction. This is in response to the frequent posts that go something like ""Due to x,y,z circumstances and events, I've decided that I'm never talking to anyone ever again, how can stoicism help me with the inevitable psychological consequences of my self-induced solitary confinement?""

I understand how someone could get an idea of the story of Seneca the Younger and him being wrongfully exiled, and I appreciate how well this story helps convey important tenants of stoicism, but I feel people run with the idea that stoicism = being alone. I also understand that Stoicism has been adopted by the ""sigma grindset"" side of social media that primarily values productivity and material success or status, which likely sends a lot of people here.

There is a concept of Oikiosis that's mostly discussed and referenced from the very early stoics like Cicero, but it's nonetheless important. My understanding of oikiosis is that it's the individual's natural instinct for self-preservation and care which extends outwards to friends and community, that helps develop an individual's moral compass. Moreover, the cardinal stoic virtue of justice does not only call for the fair treatment of others but also active contribution to the community, and this seems to be overlooked.

**In short,** if someone is dealing with a tragedy that has left them completely socially isolated, stoicism can help, but I believe, from my interpretation of the texts, that it's antithetical to stoicism to completely remove oneself from all communities. Thoughts?

**Some sources:**

""With the exception of wisdom, I'm inclined to believe that the immortal gods have given nothing better to humanity than friendship."" - Cicero

""No good thing is pleasant to possess, without friends to share it."" - Seneca

""Friendship produces between us a partnership in all our interests. There is no such thing as good or bad fortune for the individual; we live in common. And no one can live happily who has regard to himself alone and transforms everything into a question of his own utility; you must live for your neighbour, if you would live for yourself. "" - Seneca

""This is the first promise that philosophy holds out to us: fellow-feeling, humanity, sociability."" — Seneca

""Nature bore us related to one another … She instilled in us a mutual love and made us compatible … Let us hold everything in common; we stem from a common source. Our fellowship is very similar to an arch of stones, which would fall apart, if they did not reciprocally support each other"" - Seneca",Stoicism,1703274255.0,t3_18on6um,0.84,8
What are some good Stoic texts related to righteous indignation and not feeling anger and outrage when something doesn’t go my way?,"So I noticed I have this pattern where I get very angry when something doesn’t go my way. It feels like some great injustice has been done to me.

Rather than seeing it from a more objective perspective where it’s just a slight preference, that didn’t go my way, I get all bent out of shape and feel like it shouldn’t have gone that way, and things need to have gone differently, and I oftentimes get angry during these situations.

I’m looking for a way to change this behavior and be able to remain more levelheaded both in my behaviors outwardly, but also more importantly, in my inward feelings, as well.

I’m wondering if anyone has any stoic texts that they could recommend to me to help in this area?

Opinion required regarding action upon urges,"This post is somewhat inspired by a post I've seen earlier regarding sexual urges and masturbation and I've gained several thinking points from the comments there. Thus i want to ask your opinion on some issues I face.

Whenever I've acted upon my sexual urges ( be it masturbation or watching content regarding that) i feel like i have wasted the day and what ever productive thing i do or new ideas i think of on that day will result in failure down the line.

How to stop hating somebody and be stoic?,"Had an ugly falling out with a ""friend"" about nine months ago.  (He accused me of doing something I didn't do, and refused to accept my explanation.)

My hatred of him was infinite for awhile, and thankfully it's gotten at least a little better in recent weeks.  But plenty of hatred remains.

What's still holding me back from letting go completely?  I still have to see this person every week, because he works at a restaurant my husband & I frequent.  Obviously we aren't going to boycott the restaurant over this, but I do look forward to the day that he no longer works there.

Of the people I've actually known, my list of folks I absolutely loathe isn't very long:  An ex-boss, my brother, and the devil incarnate kid who came up from behind me when I was six years old and shoved my head into a tire rim just because.  Fortunately I no longer have to see any of them, so they (mostly) stay out of mind because they're far out of sight.

But I still have some rage when I encounter the jerk at the restaurant.  I wish nothing but bad things for him -- which isn't stoic, and I'm not proud of it.  I think my continued anger stems from the fact that at the time of kerfuffle, I could have really let him have it and told him off.  I didn't, and now it's too late.

Maybe the fact that I didn't tell him off was a form of stoicism?  I don't know.  But I'm really curious how some of you get so stoic that you can 100% tune out someone you despise, when that person is sometimes just a few feet away from you.

"Successful reframing of ""negative"" emotional reactions.","Ive recently had a light bulb moment regarding negative emotional reactions. 

A year ago I became aware of the childhood emotional neglect I faced growing up. I was completely burnt out and was unable to function at the caliber I had become accustomed to and expected from myself. This lead me to discovering CPTSD, followed by Stoicism. I'm sure the emotional neglect contributed to my negative emotional reactions, so this might seem more obvious to some.

Over the last year I would seem to grasp the Stoic philosophy, taking control over my negative emotional reactions but then a particular hardship would come along and trigger me, and make my understanding and practice of Stoicism become muddled and confusing. 

If someone was taking advantage of me or if someone was criticizing me unfairly I would become upset. I would try to work through this by telling myself ""don't worry about things that are out of my control"", ""how I respond is what's important, not what someone does"", ""judge myself on how I'm acting, don't project my morals onto others"", ""be kind to them, they are not intending to be mean, they're just ignorant"". Etc etc. Despite reading and reminding myself of Stoic philosophy, after each challenging situation I would still be upset inside. I was still feeling upset by the actions of others. I didn't know how to truly believe something that I didnt like, wasn't a negative. I also felt complacent, as if I wasn't standing up for myself in these situations. I couldn't make it all come together neatly and calmly in my mind and my gut. 

But then it hit me. How I'm viewing the hardship/unfavorable action is all wrong. I had been trying to deflect my negative reactions by looking inward for comfort, when I should have been looking inward to change my perspective. 

Below I've outlined 2 examples of my reframing and what response it yields. 

""Someone is taking advantage of me"" becomes ""someone is doing something I don't like"". Instead of having a negative emotional reaction to being taken advantage of, I now have the option to simply and matter of fact-ly communicate my needs and expectations or remove myself from the situation. Saying I am being taken advantage of is a judgement/assumption I am making of their behaviour/intention, and it makes me a victim. That's a tough pill to swallow. It comes from my own expectations of how others should act, it comes from my ego. Removing the judgement statement makes it much easier for me to respond rationally. 

""Someone is judging/criticizing me"" becomes ""i dont agree with someone's opinion of me"". Again, instead of viewing myself negatively through their eyes, which causes me to become defensive, I am simply saying we disagree on the topic, that their truth isn't THE truth. I can either express my views in a virtuous manner, agree to disagree, or consider their perspective and aim to improve if needed. My internal dialog switched from labeling myself as the problem, to labeling the problem as the problem. 

I would love hear more ""negative emotional reactions/judgements = neutral statement replacement"" that others can think of!",Stoicism,1703199062.0,t3_18nzowk,0.99,18

Understanding my own meditations,"I am fairy new to Stoicism I have been trying to write out conversations I have in my head in order to better understand myself and my emotions. I'm hoping with my recent studies of Stoicism, I am able to apply the values into my thoughts. I'd love to hear any feedback or to add some Stoic wisdom to better relate to yourself.

Why am I such an emotionally sensitive individual?

It feels like I don’t know how to take anything as a joke anymore. I used to brush everything off and laugh about it, but now I don’t know how to respond. 

No one is truly joking about anything they say. There is always some sense of truth behind their words. 

\- But people do joke, you have just been accustomed to bullying.

“I don’t see much you bring to the table other than constant sensitivity”

\- See? Bully.

Why cant a man be emotional without being ridiculed? Humans are designed to have emotion, it’s what allows you to express your soul. Men are told to remain unobstructed by any of life's mishaps. 

\- Correct. You must still allow yourself to process your own emotional reactivity to the thoughts following a specific event. 

Yes; however, we are still ridiculed for our emotions. The insecurities of others leaks out of them as they bark at  you for being able to be honest and open with yourself and your emotions. 

\- Then leave them as they were. Their thoughts and emotions don't pertain to you.  ",Stoicism,1703212842.0,t3_18o4hab,0.99,1

anyways in one of the lessons the author says that before doing any course of action i should think before doing it.

i think this is a great advice and for some it's common sense but does anyone do it? i'm not saying nobody does it i'm genuinely curious cause it seems like it's so time consuming because we make more 1000 decision a day and more than 1000 action so thinking before doing anything omg that would be soul killing.

ps: i'm asking because i want to understand this lesson better cause throught my whole life i always said and done stupid things especially (the problem of saying stupid things and doing them only occurs when i'm around my family and that makes me so sad idk why really i really love my family and respect them.) when i'm around my family, said things i regret saying and doing. so i think this lesson if done correctly and practiced could help make me a better person. and i don't know why i'm so foolish around my family. but it is what it is.

Eternal Return and Free Will.,"Hi!
I found the concept of Eternal Return which was practiced by Stoics, especially the earliest ones. I have got a question. 
So, according to the theory of eternal return, time is cyclical, it repeats itself and according to some posts I've seen here, it all happens over again, the same way it was before, so I understood that if there is a Glad_Communications posting this today, there was another Glad_Communications in the past cycle and there will be another one in the future cycles. And as far as my studies in Stoicism work, then nature is deterministic, which means that there are things which will inevitably happen, but we have some degree of free will according to the knowledge we have and will have, so... in that way, isn't then determinism and eternal return mutually exclusive? Because nature then would then be pre-deterministic.",Stoicism,1703177066.0,t3_18nraab,0.67,2

Loving Evil People," Reading The Meditations, Marcus Aurelius says that the height of all logic that all stoics should seek out is loving every last human being. I have been contemplating this for a few weeks but keep coming to a dead end... I have felt freed by loving those who are condescending or mean to me instead of stewing in my own damaged ego or pride. However, I don't understand how I can possibly love someone like Hitler or Leopold II or other people like them who are undoubtedly horrific monsters. I understand that people are a product of their environment, but at a certain point you are making a willing choice to continue down a path of moral corruption. I can have faith that people can change, but many people (like Hitler and Leopold) will never change. How and why is it important to love those who spread hatred and death?

I just got fired,"My life couldn’t get any more unfortunate lol.

I missed a shift a few weeks ago because of a technical error that didn’t notify me that I was scheduled for that day. My supervisor notified me of this and I assured her it wouldn’t happen again but there was literally no way I could have prevented this.

Fast foward to a couple weeks later and I’m scheduled for a shift that conflicts with my unavailability (another technical issue). On the day before my shift starts (2 hours in advance) I let my supervisor know that I won’t be able to attend because of a competition. She responds 4 hours later and because of competition rules, I can’t use my phone and respond to her in a timely manner. I see her message a few hours later asking me to come in late but I see that it’s past the time of the shift. Here’s where I know I messed up- I eventually end up not followingup with her as I believe it would be better just to leave things as is since I thought the situation was under control.

I message her a few days after that regarding a question and everything seems cool, no mention of any issues regarding the whole situation or anything like that. Then, I receive an email on Monday saying that I’m being terminated for my low availability (this was the topic of the question i messaged to her) and that I’ve had two no-shows with little communication.

Dichotomy on Control as an argument about Identity,"Here is something I've been considering that I wanted to get the community's opinion on. I think that the dichotomy of control is better understood as an argument about **identity** (what we fundamentally are), than an argument about control, influence, or cause. 

The Handbook introduces the Dichotomy of control as follows: ""Some things are within our power, while others are not. Within our power are opinion, motivation, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever is of our own doing; not within our power are our body, our property, reputation, office, and, in a word, whatever is not of our own doing."" ( Handbook 1.1 Hard Translation).

Most people take this to mean that there are three things are play:

1. Us (who we are)
2. The things up to us (Opinion, motivation, desire)
3. The things not up to us (body, our property, reputation).

Instead, I think the argument is better thought of as this:   
1. There are the things that we ARE, that make up our identity (our opinions and desires).  
2. There are the things that we ARE NOT, that don't make up our identity (our body, our reputation).

Therefore, we should focus on improving and caring about what we fundamentally are. Our life goes better when WE are better (better opinions, better desires). Our life does not go worse when things WE ARE NOT get damaged (our office, our property). The DOC then is not about describing what we can or can't control, but about where the limits of our identity lie, which technically for Epictetus is our Prohairesis (our faculty of choice).

It is a change in the emphasis of the argument. Epictetus is not *just* saying that we suffer when we try to control what is outside our control (although that is true). He is emphasizing that we suffer when we identify ourselves with the things that are not up to us. When we think something belongs to us (is up to us) that doesn't.

This is why in Discourses 1.1 Epictetus focuses so much on personal identity. He presents an example with a tyrant: ""'Tell me your secrets.' I won't reveal them; for that lies within my power. 'Then I'll have you chained up.' What are you saying, man, chain *me* up? You can chain my leg, but not even Zeus can overcome my power of choice (prohairesis). 'I'll throw you into prison.' You mean my poor body.""

The humour in this passage is that the tyrant is trying to threaten Epictetus, but the tyrant is applying a non-Stoic perspective. He is threatening Epictetus' body, but Epictetus realizes that he is not his body and so he is not intimidated. He is his character, his prohairesis, his capacity to make choices. That is what applying the Dichotomy of control looks like in action, not just saying ""oh well, I can't control what you do."".

What do you think?

Stressed about money and future and status and happiness,"NOTE: I have ADHD and Crohn's, which I think influences why I feel this way. I'm posting here because I've found Stoicism helpful in the past and I think people here will have a unique perspective on this. 

&#x200B;

I naturally stay up late and wake up late. When I don't have external demands on me, I tend to sleep between 2am and 4am and wake up between 10am and 1pm. 

Obviously, when I was in school, I had to be there from 8-4 ish every day (well, excluding the large amount of days I skipped or left at lunch or showed up after lunch). I honestly can't remember how I did it. I think I was usually just groggy and annoyed for a few hours and then felt better as the day went on. 

After college, I tried to work various jobs that started in the morning, around 8 or 9. I quit all of them relatively quickly because I just hated getting up so early. I hated feeling rushed. I hated not having time to eat breakfast or have coffee or tea. I hated driving to work in rush hour traffic. 

After a couple years I went to Korea to teach in an afterschool English academy. My hours were 3pm-10pm ish. It was awesome. I'd get up, enjoy my morning, go for a hike or something, eat lunch, and head to class feeling good. My job was fun and I was good at it. Then I'd relax at night or walk around or whatever I wanted and just go to sleep when I felt tired. 

The problem is as I'm getting older I'm a bit stressed about money and the future and all that stuff. My job in Korea provided a free apartment, but the salary wasn't much. I could save a few hundred dollars a month if I tried. I came back to the US after 2 years with about 4 grand. 

I applied to a bunch of jobs in the US. The two interviews I got were car salesman (which sounded terrible and would have me working like 10 hours a day) and concessions at the movie theater (which I took and I'm enjoying, but obviously the money is very little). 

I've thought about ways I could make more money and I basically came up with 3 options. 

1) Do something online like writing or making videos or learning to code- This would be good because of flexibility, but it's hard to predict whether you will be successful. Also, I tend to get down if I don't socialize for awhile. I get energy from being around people and I don't know if I could be happy sitting in my room for 8 hours a day. 

2) Become a ""real"" teacher- This would require me to get a teaching license and/or masters degree. I could potentially end up working in international schools, which sounds cool. They also get paid a lot better than academy teachers. But from what I've heard, you generally have to spend 2 years teaching in the US or an undesirable country before you get a job somewhere I'd want to live. I really don't want to do that. And honestly, I don't want to go back to the school schedule, waking up at 6 or 7am. And I don't want to teach big classes, like 30-40 kids. The max at my old job was 12 and even that felt a bit much to me. 

3) Go to law school- I did well in debate, majored in philosophy, and got a good score on a practice LSAT. I think I have the skills to excel in this. But working as a lawyer requires a 9-5 type job (or worse if you want to make a lot of money). And also I think a lot of it will be boring and tedious and ethically grey, which I don't like. When I think about it, I did well in debate, but it also stressed me out a lot and I could get mad when judges were stupid or people were mean to me. 

&#x200B;

So, as you can see, I have no idea what to do next haha. I think two of the biggest things holding me back are not wanting to work a ""normal"" schedule or live in places I don't want to live in. To be honest, what I want to do is go back to working in an academy in Korea. I think I was the happiest I've ever been there and I miss it. But I'm scared of not making much money as I get older. 

I don't really care much about money myself. I really wish I didn't have to think about it. I kind of hate thinking about it. But it's important for security, in case of emergencies or what not. And I'm worried about my ability to date or get married as I get older if I don't start making more money. Most girls I dated in my 20's didn't seem to care, but will they if I'm in my 30s and still not making a lot? 

Anyone relate to this or have any advice? 

My dad wants me to go to law school and I think my mom wants me to get a masters in education, but I think I might end up hating either one. I want to go back to teaching in an academy, but I'm worried and feel I might be embarrassed to still be doing that in my 30s. I turn 30 in October.

Is this Stoicism?,"I read a book by the famous historical polymath ibn Hazm and something in my mind says its stoic.

He wrote:

""These words encapsulate all 
virtue: to control oneself against passion means in fact to turn 
away from one’s natural tendency towards anger and lust, 
things which are both under the dictates of passion. Then all 
that is left for the soul to use is the intellect which God has 
given it, the good sense which distinguishes it from the beasts, 
from insects or vermin and from tigers. “Never lose your 
temper,” as Allah’s Prophet (peace be upon him) said to a 120
man asking advice, and, as he also said commanding him, “Do 
as you would be done by” , together encapsulate the whole of 121
virtue


He further writes about the goal of all humans and all nations, 
“I have tried to find one goal which everyone would agree to be 
excellent and worthy of being striven after. I have found one 
only: to be free from anxiety. When I reflected upon it, I 
realized that not only do all agree in valuing it and desiring it, 
but I also perceived that, despite their many different passions 
and aspirations and preoccupations and desires, they never 
make the slightest gesture unless it is designed to drive anxiety 
far away. One man loses his way, another comes close to going 
wrong, finally another is successful - but he is a rare man, and 
success is rare, (O all-knowing Allah). Dispelling anxiety is a 
goal upon which all nations agree from the time when the 
Almighty created the world until the day when this world will 
pass away and be followed by the Day of Judgment - and their 
actions are directed to this goal alone. In the case of every 
other objective there will always be some people who do not 
desire it. For example, some people are not religious and do 
not take eternity into account. There are some who by nature 
and inclination prefer obscurity to fame [the obscurity of 
satisfied passion]. There are some who have no interest in 
amassing a fortune, preferring abstinence to ownership; this 
was the case with many of the Prophets. May peace be upon 
them all - and those who followed their example, ascetics and 
philosophers. There are some who by nature dislike sensual 
pleasures and scorn those who seek after them, such as those 
men we have just mentioned, and who prefer to lose a fortune 
rather than gain one. Some prefer ignorance to knowledge, in 
fact most of the people that you see in the street are like this. 
These are the objectives of people who have no other aim in 
life. Nobody in the whole world, from the time of its creation 
until its end, would deliberately choose anxiety, and would not 
desire to drive it far away. When I had arrived at this great 
piece of wisdom, when I had discovered this amazing secret, 
when Allah the Almighty had opened the eyes of my mind.


it should refrain from this passion, and the [Prophet’s] 
commandment to do as you would be done implies that the 
souls should turn away from the strong force of greed and lust 
and should uphold the authority or the means of justice which 
springs from the rationality which is part of the reasonable soul. 
I have seen the majority of people - except those who God the 
Almighty has protected, and they are few - throw themselves 
into the miseries, the worries and fatigues of this world, and 
pile up a mountain of sin which will mean that they enter 
hellfire in the Hereafter and will have no advantage from the 
perfidious intentions which they nurse so carefully, such as 
wishing for an inflation of prices which would bring disaster 
upon the children, the innocent, or wishing the worst trials 
upon those they hate. They know very well that these bad 
intentions will not necessarily bring about what they desire or 
guarantee its advent, and if they clarified and improved their 
intentions they would hasten the repose of their spirits. They 
would then have the time to devote themselves to their own 
business and would thus profit a great deal in addition to the 
return of their souls to God, and all this without having at all 
hastened or delayed the realization of their desires. Is there any 
worse deception than the attitude which we warn against here, 
and is there any greater happiness than the one which we are 
promoting?”122

How to avoid letting stoicism cause dismissiveness?,"“What can I do about my brothers anger?”

Nothing. You can do nothing about it. But you can control your response to his anger” I.e. don’t get angry just because he’s angry

This is true and it’s valuable to focus on not letting other people’s reactions cause you to react in a similar way

But at the same time, this feels pretty black and white. Maybe you can help your brother with his anger by asking what’s going on to cause it, maybe you did something that understandably contributed to his anger, and it’s unfair for you to say “hm his anger is his own problem, nothing I can do”. 

I guess what I’m asking is this: it seems that taking stoic lessons perfectly literally can cause some unfavorable interpersonal dynamics. Do you agree or disagree?",Stoicism,1703077627.0,t3_18mu6dh,0.83,11
How to switch from easy things you enjoy to Tough things you enjoy,"Greetings everyone,
The way Social media apps are designed its very easy to get content or things that you like and watch them to get pleasure.
Now
I do get pleasure from reading, working out, playing chess, puzzles, sports etc but these things require a little more effort to do than watching videos on smartphone or any other digital product.
I would love the suggestion on it if anyone has done it.
If anyone has any examples from history or literature and how stoics delt with it I would love them too.

I feel guilty and scared of my emotional responses,"Yesterday I had what started as a funny argument on a random topic. My sister and my husband had an opposite view as mine and both of them where interrupting me while I was trying to speak. I said “Shut the fuck up” which was meant in a jokingly way but my face showed my frustration of being repeatedly interrupted. They both said wow that’s not cool and I apologised on the spot. My sister got really triggered and threw in my face that I cry when someone tells me something that hurts my feelings but I say things like that when I am angry. Also I confess that lately I feel very emotional when I see my sister and my husband “coming together “ against me.

The point is that she has a point. I am a very sensitive person, I get emotional very easily and I just want to stop reacting. I feel like I always says something wrong and I feel terrible and insecure afterwards. I feel like I am a bad person for having these reactions. It looks like everyone can be cool and easy going but me, like I am always making mistakes and that the people I love will get tired of me.

Should I avoid confrontation? How can I be a better, wiser person? How do I deal with my insecurities?

I write this in this page because I am trying to learn stoicism. I spend most of my days alone at home and I feel happy and at peace. Then I am tested with actual people, and people are just hard form me. Any stoic material suggestions are appreciated.

Is Mark Manson a stoic?,"I ended up here in a backwards kind of way. When I discovered stoicism, it felt like it just described the way I felt, put it into words. In the year after my divorce in middle-age, I read Models, by Mark Manson. After that my mindset changed, and after a few years I characterized myself as a stoic once I learned what that meant. I've not read any of the stoic texts, only what I've seen quoted.

Need help understanding,"Hello all, I'm 25(M) new to these pracitices. I would like to say right away I know reddit is not the best place to come to for advice. I feel lost, alone and not understood. Posting here as i don't really know what else to do other than seek anonymous help and what others opinions are. 

I have a really hard time either processing emotions or understanding them. I messed up yesterday and freaked out, all because I felt like an idiot because I kept pushing a place to go for vacation that people couldn't afford. Was not upset about that at all, more so because I was embarrassed and feel bad they didn't tell me and told my brother. It doesn't even make sense. I'm trying to figure out why I get like this. I'm starting to think I have emotional baggage that I haven't processed yet that causes me to act this way. My confidence is so low already and always feeling so unsure about myself might be a root cause?

I want to start learning and practicing stoicism so I can control my emotions. An old friend told me a couple months ago that I used to be so happy and care free. Didn't really hit me till now that they are right. I also think because I gained weight back that I lost 5 years ago that I'm not feeling myself.

What should a stoic define as true power?,"I'm in a career which gives me a lot of responsibility and authority but it tends to become fairly political. Due to this, mentors and advisors frequently recommend books like The Prince or the 48 Laws of Power. However, these books don't align with the values of a stoic and are ruthlessly pragmatic. I'm not sure how to incorporate the understanding I have gathered from these while maintaining my character.
The question I want to explore is how should I view power as a stoic, especially when the choices I make effect the lives of others. I literally hold people's lives in my hands due to my career, so do I owe it to them to be as ruthlessly pragmatic as possible?
Do I play the game and behave disingenuously, even if it goes again the principles of Stoicism?",Stoicism,1703041770.0,t3_18mkciy,0.74,7
How would stoics view modernity?,"
Modern day hook up culture plaguing the youth, wide spread availability of drugs, instant pleasure at our finger tips, no real commitments to anything, hyper active behavior everywhere, no real search for meaning, feminization of men, wide spread obesity, being a father or mother is seen as a ""waste"", lust and greed driven, etc...

I could go on with hundreds more but you clearly get the picture.

Before you say, ""that's a minority group and your spending to much time on social media...🤓"" I agree it is a minority, however, I lump it all together to create what I would consider a small majority group, or at least maybe that's where it's heading.

I dont really consume any social media and I'm not some old guy behind the times. I'm really young and I just like philosiphy.

So back to the question:

How would stoics, like Marcus Aurelius or Seneca, view our society today? Is it much different than theirs at the time? Also, what would they say to us in regards to how we should live, or what we can do to change?

Talk only when needed?,"After countless conversations I had with people, I am thinking about not getting involved in conversations.

Whenever I try to have a conversation, I try to be as close to reality as possible, instead of having my opinions or my conditioning. People most often take it offensive and project their hatred towards me.

Some people try to shut me off by saying I sound like a philosopher. Some people appreciate it though. 

It feels exhausting. I start to question why do I even have these conversations in the first place.

People often can't really accept reality. I don't know every truth ever. But I can perceive it to some extent.

To me a conversation is about exchange of information to learn and grow. There is some amount of egoic identity involved as well personally. I am not going to deny it. Still learning to not take it personally when I am defeated and trying to learn from it. 

I right now feel like I only need to talk when there is something gonna change if I contribute to the conversation. If things are not going to change, then why even take part in the conversation? 

If both the parties learn and grow, then it's fine. Or else observation and silence is better I guess.

Preparation for starvation," This may seem somewhat  pessimistic, but after deep consideration I realize this is a more likely issue I'm going to face in the future. Currently my families financial situation is mid at the moment. There's me, my mom and my grandfather. Truth be told we're solely dependent on my grandfather's pension. My mother is a housewife with only a high-school diploma. I passed my graduation and I have been trying for job for 6 years but to no hope whatsoever in the horizon. I did a lot of odd jobs and with recession in the country lost the current job I have. I'm have been trying for quite some time but it's to no avail. We have been rationing a lot of our food, but with grandfather's advance age and all and his medical bills, it seems it not enough. He's well psst 90 and he's have a lot of co morbidity. If he dies we can manage for a while but after a year or so we'll be dead broke. To prepare myself for that likely future I have been trying to prepare myself for stark starvation by eating a meal a day. Sometimes even no meals. I have been doing it for quite a few months now.

"Loved Meditations, STRUGGLING with Discourses","I read the Hayes translations of Meditations and loved it.  I then went to the Haward Morse audiobook of Discourses (Gregory Long translation.)  I'm STRUGGLING, with entire sentences, paragraphs passing by with little comprehension. The heavy English accent and old translation, combined with the fact that I consume these as audiobooks while doing long distance running, has me wondering if I'm wasting my time (7.5 more hours to go).

I'm trying to decide do I:

1. Quit, start over with a new translation and narrator, or
2. Suffer through it, or
3. Quit entirely and instead read a modern distillation of Stoicism (""The Daily Stoic"" or other)?

Observation from Beyond Good and Evil regarding criticism of Stoicism,"I am working my way through Beyond Good and Evil for the first time. In book two, Nietzsche goes on a tirade against a few different philosophies - including Stoicism. In it, he mocked the Stoics for wanting to live in accord with nature and basically said the Stoics imprint their own morality onto nature this way and that nature is ultimately indifferent. 

Then, later in book III he is talking about religious people and specifically about Christianity in Europe. In this section he says:

“Then, during the moral epoch of mankind, one sacrificed to one’s God one’s own strongest instincts, one’s “nature“: this festive joy lights up the cruel eyes of the aesthetic, the “anti-natural” enthusiast.”


Seems to me like this definition of nature that he claims is being sacrificed is rather close to the Stoic idea of acting within one’s own nature. To “live according to one’s nature” as I understand it (correct me if I am wrong) means, broadly for humans, living in according with what makes humans unique - their ability to reason. 


Does it seem like his argument about sacrificing one’s nature seems to go against the argument he made against stoicism? In my reading it seems like he miss-characterized what “nature” is in the stoic context and then, albeit loosely, admitted to the existence of “nature” in the form the stoics use by conceding some people do sacrifice their nature.

I could be reading too much into it, any thoughts from someone more versed in Nietzsche and Stoic thought?",Stoicism,1702945878.0,t3_18locod,0.85,5
Explaining Mortality and Death To Small Kids,"Curious to get some perspective. 

My five year old son will make a wish blowing out a birthday candle or something and I always tell him I hope all his wishes come true.  The other day he said, he has a wish that he know won't come true and then whispered ""I don't want to die"".  He then said he also doesn't want me or other family members to die.  

It's odd how over the past several years studying stoicism I've just fallen into the habit of contemplating my mortality and that of my loved ones on a near daily basis.  This might sound incredibly depressing to some, but it's really not.  Rather I see it as just being aware of how nature works and it also gives perspective into what I think is important to do with the present moment.  It's also amazing how this habit has cleared up some fears and self-doubt, but I digress.  

I've gotten into the habit of thinking before I speak.  I think it's a good habit, otherwise I might have said something like: ""you're right, we're all going to die eventually and that's just how things work but try to not let it bother you"" or some other thing that probably wouldn't really be beneficial for either of us.  Instead I just said ""it's important to focus on the time we have right now and enjoy the present moment of being here with each other"" and gave him a big hug.  

I feel like I somewhat avoided the question and have been thinking of other ways that I could respond, so appreciate any other perspectives.

"I need good advice from some stoic men, because i dont know what will happen to me now, im getting death threats in highschool","So around two weeks ago, my life was going well, my self esteem was rising from a shit 2022, and i thought i was out of the ringer. Then all that hope was thrashed into peices. bassically this kid that i was sort of friends with made this rumor about me saying that i leaked his home adress. This was a blow as i thought this kid was my friend. Then my popualarity and reputation that i once had crumbled. I thought this was the deepest pit of hell a man can face, all his friends who he realises are fake leaving him, although it got worse, so much more worse. Then he added  me to this group chat on snapchat and got this kid to threaten me and press me, no matter how much i tried to explain they would not understamd the truth. They forced me to confess to somthing i did not do under the threat of a beating. And i thought that that was it, it got worse, this was probably the first time i experienced real trauma, and im only a highschooler. They added me to another chat with 15 other kids, who were all gang affiliated although in highschool and they threatened me, harrased me and even said they would stab me. Those thoughts keep me up at night. Anyways i kept this all to myself, my pearents did not need added stress, and i was forced to pay these people 20$ to let me live. It got worse, the next weekend i had a family gathering, in wich took my mind of taht trauma, on monday i checked my snapchat, apparently over the weekend i was placed in another groupchat with even more kids, giving more death threats to me. the things they said made my shiver, i gave one $20 now they all wanted up to 50$ saying they wanted a new vape or a new knife. But when they did not get a response from me as i was busy with the gathering and hanging out with my cousins. They moved on to 3 other kids, pressing them, death threating them, they sent images of their guns and knives and vapes to them, and even took $50 from them. I could not let this slide, i had to make sure this would nto happen again, i got another phone and recorded the whole conversation,this way they would not know i collected this. That should atleast send them to juvie right? But i wanna tell the authorities in a way that would not let them know that i was the snitch, cos if they find out man then idk what will happen... anyways its been 3 weeks, school break has started,i deleted my snap account and blocked them all, i only have my family and becaus of erliar events no friends to spend the break with.

I can’t cry anymore.,"Hi everyone,

I am on my stoicism journey since one and a half year. I love the idea of controlling myself, my thoughts, my emotions & my actions. Sometimes I am driven by external circumstances, but I think that I am making a great progress in quickly realising what is under my control and what is not.

The reason:
Since 2 months I am experiencing a downfall of my relationship. I know my faults, I know what I did wrong, and I am taking a full responsibility of changing those things. Simply saing - my fault is that I was controlling. 

But everything seems that there is nothing left to save - my woman is extremely passive-agressive towards me, almost to the point that I question my own humanity. She makes me feel like a monster. Someone that is not worth fighting for.

I live in a constant state of alert, wondering when the day of saying goodbye comes. One day everything seems fine, and the second day she strikes me right in my heart. And yet, I don’t feel sad. I don’t know how to blame her for being shitty because I know her behaviour is not under my control. At the same time I can’t stop loving her, because I see those good days we have had.

She might be doing this to break me & make me pull the trigger first, so I will be a „bad” one in this relationship. The one that decided to left. Or she might be testing me if I am all into really changing my behaviour.

The question:
The thing that bothers me the most is that I used to be a very emotional man, but I can’t dive into my feelings anymore. I used to cry when I was upset or sad, but I can’t do it anymore. I just can’t. And I know everything would be much easier for me if I could. 

Can it be an early stage of depression? What the #%@! should I do? What the virtuous, spiritual man would do being in my place? I know some things, but I definitely don’t know what to do in that exact situation. God, please, give me strength & courage to do the right thing.",Stoicism,1702941541.0,t3_18lmq9q,0.74,2

How to strengthen our mind?,"Read a quote "" People work to increase physical strength but lack to work on mental strength or something like that, what does strengthening our mind means like what to do?",Stoicism,1702913206.0,t3_18lbca2,0.88,6
Tochange thoughts or actions?,"In a recent post, u/home_iswherethedogis commented:

>The only solution to cognitive dissonance is to change your actions. Sure, you can change your beliefs (opinions) about cigarettes to ""oh, I'm young, I'll worry about my lungs later,"" but this will keep you stuck in smoking because you can't change a habit without changing the belief surrounding it. 

Id like to discuss this specific part further. For this given example, in the end clinically smoking is bad for humans. The resolutions given when boiled down were change thoughts or change actions.

In a different case: Maybe someone percieves that their work environment is rather hostile to them. When in reality, everyone thinks they're mediocre at worst. They could change their actions in the form of a job change, or change the way they perceive the work environment.

Point being, if one decides to change something, how do they decide on how to change? Maybe this dips a little too far into the ""Stoicism is not a replacement for therapy"", maybe I'm getting too far into the weeds of it and it really is as simple as ""it depends""

My father is an enigma..,"I [33M], like many, used to think as my father as stoic, however, he's gotten soft and depressed in his older age, especially now that he's retired. Not that he's accomplished a  great deal in his life, but he raised me right, taught me how to be a strong leader, and remain unbothered by external happenings.

I enjoy giving him this credit but I've also done a fair bit of development personally, professionally, emotionally, spiritually, and have had other mentors over the last 5-10 years. I've also became a father myself this year and am learning from that. I often wonder, am I giving him too much credit for the man I am today?

What's bothering me tonight is that my father did not show up to the family Christmas party. There is no bad blood in the family either and although we only get together a few times a year, it's something he always looks forward to. Every time.

So goddamnit, why would you no-show?

I suspect he may have something going on with his health and doesn't want to face his kids. I fear that it may be bad enough to where he can't do anything about it.

This enchiridion chapter.,"""If you intend to improve, throw away such thoughts as these: if I neglect my affairs, I shall not have the means of living: unless I chastise my slave, he will be bad. For it is better to die of hunger and so to be released from grief and fear than to live in abundance with perturbation; and it is better for your slave to be bad than for you to be unhappy.1 Begin then from little things. Is the oil spilled? Is a little wine stolen? Say on the occasion, at such price is sold freedom from perturbation; at such price is sold tranquillity, but nothing is got for nothing. And when you call your slave, consider that it is possible that he does not hear; and if he does hear, that he will do nothing which you wish. But matters are not so well with him, but altogether well with you, that it should be in his power for you to be not disturbed.""

Does being virtuous becomes easier and easier the more virtuous you become?,"Today I was thinking about why I had no will to do what I'm supposed to do(study some engineering concepts), my mind keeps creating like mechanisms for me to think ""why would I suffer studying, maybe I am having a burnout?(lol)"" and then, when the end of the day comes and I did nothing, I feel like shit. Like, if virtue is the only true source of happiness then why is it so hard to act virtuously. Then I came across a possible explanation: The starting of becoming virtuous is extra hard, because of the vices you already have, the thoughts and opinions you already formed, and that's why the start is so painful.

How do I behave around people I have disappointed (including myself)?,"Few months ago, a girl I was dating suddenly broke up with me without much of closure (we had some communication problems and her being younger, she was in a different life stage). Unfortunately, going to the same band, which I was not willing to give up after 8 years of playing, I had to see her quite regularly. Even still, recently, I have finally started to move on. Then, three days ago, we were at the same party with our band and I got blackout drunk (although this kind of behaviour is not usual for me). 

Afterwards, I found out directly from her that I wanted to talk with her about us, although she did not, and that I behaved like a condescending jerk. She did not want to elaborate further, simply stating 'drunk men's words are sober man's thoughts', so I don't know my behaviour specificaly (and I really fear it could have been even worse). Of course I apologized and promised it won't happen again, giving myself a word I will further limit my occasional alcohol consumption. However, I have never thought I could behave like this and feel that I have deeply let myself down.

How to deal with expectations of recognition for doing the right thing?,"I've been interested in stoicism for a few years, and although I wouldn't say I'm an avid student of it, I do try to implement the stoic virtues and practices in my life.

By doing this, I find that often I choose the path of righteousness, of forgiveness, and seldom do I seek revenge or do evil.

My problem, however, is that I keep expecting recognition for doing such things. I feel like I deserve congratulations for making the rigth choices and doing the right acts. And I realize this corrupts my initial intentions as a whole. To the point where I can't tell when I'm doing good because I am virtuous and when I'm doing it to be percieved as good and mature.

To give you an example, I recently ended a friends with benefits kind of relationship, and this person is now dating my best friend. Note that I told my friend beforehand that if he was interested in her, I wouldn't be a problem and he could go for it. I had also told her during our arrangement that if she was interested in him, it would be okay, and she could just tell me and we'd end our relationship for the sake of theirs (because I didn't want a commitment with her, and they both wanted it).

She did not tell me she was interested, but she showed clear signs. She was quite disrespectful and hurtful to me a few times due to her inability to perceive and communicate her feelings. And I just did what was best for me and ended things between us.

And now, all I can fathom is that I made their relationship possible, and I feel like both her and my friend should thank me for it.

How do I get rid of this expectation? I've been reading Meditations but to no avail thus far.

A visualization/realization I've been having,"I thought I would share this in hopes sometime else has success with it.

I've studied Taoism in the past, and although I find it really similar to Stoicism, they go about things so differently.  Taoism seems to focus on truly accepting the things we can't change, while stoicism focuses on making the changes we with what we have.

With Taoism, I would do meditations where I imagined having an energy/chi inside me providing me with stability and warmth.  It's been very relaxing and calming to do this, especially while anxious.  So I decided to see how I could apply this to Stoicism.

When I think about what I can really change, it comes down to literally moving my hands, getting up, etc. way more than making money out something abstract as that.  So with that, I've been imagining the same ball of energy I used to keep on the inside, but just barely outside of me.  The gravity of it almost pulls me to motion and helps me see I am in control of myself completely and not ""stuck to the couch"" or whatever.

As a last note, these are purely meditations and figments of the imagination.  I see visualisation of my chi as similar to a *dogmata* or *mantra*, not something real or tangible.",Stoicism,1702876503.0,t3_18l0zkb,0.6,1

"A question about Risk, its worthiness and untimely death","Hello, 
I've been thinking of taking up some activities ( motorcycling, horse riding , a career that's risky in terms of mortality) that are sort of risky but am afraid of doing them for fear of injury or worse.

All my life I've erred on the side of caution, taking only calculated risks where the risks seems worthy enough, if the possibility of danger was even nominal I'd back off ( for example, i recently decided not to do river rafting). I am not lacking in courage but feel it best only to take risks that are ""worth it"".

Now I've been through some of the writings of George RR Martin and while its fiction in it a good number of characters -- good and bad die in the both unexpected and gruesome ways never fulfilling their destiny or their potential for great and noble things.

It also reminded me of Alexander The Great who wanted to conquer the world but died of Malaria, the second of the Mughal conquerers Humayan who died -- by falling from stairs in a library! 

The last great Hindu king who came from nothing but died from a single stray arrow hitting the only small single gap in his armor, Christopher reeves who fell from horseback and got paralyzed..any many other examples.

It makes me feel its better to stick to only necessary things. 

Why take these risks (motorcycling, horse riding) at all? I can make go through it for the career

This makes me afraid, what if i take any of these risks and get scared injured or die ...never even beginning to have fulfilled my duties or potential? 

P.S. I understand about the dichotomy of control and am not scared of death as a concept ( Death smiles at all men...all a man can do is smile back)..but the timing and worthiness of it",Stoicism,1702818583.0,t3_18kh0t8,0.82,7

"Not sure what the point of this post is, maybe just to get things off my mind."," 

Im a 20-year-old guy who recently wrapped up my gap year with a lot of hard work. Despite earning good money, I didn't save any. I spent it on a car and started but never finished my driving license. Now, the car sits unused, and another insurance payment is coming up.

Most of my earnings went into partying and, unfortunately, drugs. Thankfully, I've kicked that habit and don't feel the urge anymore—except when I drink, which is rare now. I've started university but missed three months of classes. I want to contact university about my situation but im scared they will kick me out for not doing any work at all. I like my course and the topics, but I can't bring myself to engage. I label myself as lazy, but when I attempt something, I can't seem to enjoy it.

While I hesitate to say I'm depressed, I feel lost. I enjoy life, people, even the ""bad"" ones, but I struggle to like myself or work on self-improvement. I have a wonderful girlfriend, and I know I'm smart, but when things start improving, I feel out of place, and they take a downturn again.

Two years ago, I lost my dad to alcohol, went through a breakup, and lost a friend, all in one year. Looking back, that seems to be when things started spiraling, and im not looking for an excuse, i cannot control that. 

I often compare myself to my successful sister, measuring my worth by materialistic standards, despite knowing it's not a healthy approach.

Today, my MacBook screen broke, adding to my stress as repairs will strain my already dead budget, but life continues with or with out. I'm not sure if this post even makes sense, but I felt the need to write and seek constructive criticism or just an understanding ear. It's strange—I know what I need to do, but I'm just not doing it. I'm trying, but it's all so confusing. This may sound like a cry for help, and I'm aware of that. I appreciate stoicism and the people here, and I just wanted to unload my thoughts.

If most of this doesnt make sense, dont worry, it doesnt in my head also.

Stoic View on Entertainment,"I recently watched All Quiet on the Western Front and enjoyed it.  I didn’t spend time analyzing my judgments about the movie while it’s happening as that would distract me from the plot. I just let my emotions run without questioning them. 

While watching movies I allow myself to get emotionally invested in the characters and the overall narrative for the duration of the film. A large part of the enjoyment I get out of reading fiction is from getting caught up in narrative, and viewing the world through the characters perspectives. These characters are usually flawed in some ways of course and are going to have errors in their reasoning.  Similarly, a large part of watching live sports is rooting for a team. 

Would a stoic forgo these aspects of entertainment for the sake of virtue?  If so, do those of you strictly practicing stoicism miss these pastimes?

A unique and frustrating relationship (need good stoic advice),"Hey everyone. I consider myself an amateur stoic; have read Aurelius and Seneca and am currently reading Epictetus. 

A little background: So I had a 5+ year relationship that ended late 2021. We ended up remaining best friends to this day. Since then, I wanted to get back with her, but have tabled it due to her wanted to work on herself and heal some personal trauma(due to school and family deaths). Throughout the process, I have really tried to be patient, but the past 6 months or so I have been losing my patience with the situation.

The real issue: I am fine with the whole “single” dynamic and letting her heal on her own. However, I do have personal sexual needs that are not being met (I have high sex drive). The last time we had sex was Jan 2022. We live together in seperate rooms but still kiss and maintain a closeness. I have tried to work with her and be patient and understanding but there have been so many times where something can happen and she pulls away. At this point, seeing how much I am hurting, she has told me to look elsewhere to get what I need. The problem with this is that I am devoted to her and am not looking for sex in that kind of way. I am at my breaking point. It not like I am addicted or am falling prey to my desires, as I have done without for past 2 years. But I also want to experience fun and life. 

Stoicism has definitely helped me maintain the past year. But the lack of any progress coupled with my inability to move on is shaking me. Reading Seneca and how he talks about time makes this situation feel all the more urgent to me…

Stoicism for Action,"These are four principles I've written up for myself regarding Stoic action, expressing my view that Stoicism demands service to others in order to live in accordance with nature. 

I've followed each with a personal description and some of my favorite quotes regarding the matter, and included some various links to relevant articles (I <3 Donald Robertson). This is not meant to be a comprehensive defense of that view but sharing my personal reflections on it. 

&#x200B;

1. [The Common Good](https://modernstoicism.com/perspectives-the-stoics-on-the-community-of-humankind/) —> All our aims and actions should be directed towards benefitting the common good, as is in line with natural conduct and the path of virtuous action. We are temperate and courageous so we may [advocate for justice](https://www.orionphilosophy.com/stoic-blog/the-stoic-virtue-of-justice), not for tranquility or our own happiness.
   1. The pursuit of virtue, of justice among people, is that of virtuous action. To act with love, kindness, and compassion towards all others as one humanity; to engage, not withdraw, from public involvement.
   2. *“Born for society, \[the Stoics\] all believed it was their destiny to labor for it; with so much the less fatigue, their rewards were all inside themselves. Happy by their philosophy alone, it seemed as if only the happiness of others could increase theirs.”* (Montesquieu, The Spirit of Laws, 1748)
   3. *“Revere the gods, and look after each other. Life is short — the fruit of this life is a good character and acts for the common good.”* (Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations*, 6.30)
   4. *""The primary mission of the Stoics, in other words, is to be helpful to others and serve the greater good, and they don't do this to make themselves happy. They do it becaues it is the right and natural way to live. But doing it in that spirit, as it turns out, makes them happy.""* (Ward Farnsworth, *The Practicing Stoic*, 208)
   5. *""\[Happiness is found indirectly in the pursuit of other things, which as\] proposed by the Stoic consists primarily of a dedication to reason and a commitment to others -- to service, to justice, to helping in the ways one can.""* (Ward Farnsworth, *The Practicing Stoic*, 209)  

2. [**The Reserve Clause**](https://donaldrobertson.name/2013/02/02/action-with-a-reserve-clause-in-marcus-aurelius/) —> Engaging with the world of indifferents, we must act with detachment: We shall do our utmost to serve the common good, “Fate permitting.”
   1. To succeed or to fail does not make us virtuous. To act energetically in the name of good intentions is all we have the choice of doing. With a reserve clause, a life of pursuing and falling short of justice is still the noblest path.
   2. *“Try persuasion first, but even though men would say to you not to, act when the principles of justice direct you to. If anyone one should obstruct you by force, take refuge in being contented and without emotional pain, and use the obstacle for the display of some other virtue. Remember that the impulse you had was with an “reserve clause”, and your aim was not to do the impossible.”* (*Meditations*, 6.50)
   3. *“Though a man may in some sort hinder my activity, yet on my own voluntary impulses and mental attitude no fetters can be put because of the “reserve clause” and their ability to adapt to circumstances. For everything that stands in the way of its activity is adapted and transmuted by the mind into furtherance of it, and that which is a check on this action is converted into a help to it, and that which is a hindrance in our path goes but to make it easier.”* (*Meditations*, 5.20)  

3. [**Virtue in**](https://donaldrobertson.name/2018/05/15/the-stoic-socrates-four-emotional-resilience-strategies/) **& through Adversity** —> The world provides us with challenges so that we may test ourselves, become more virtuous and capable, and learn to find the value in all that may happen. We have virtues to face challenges; by facing challenges, we become virtuous. 
   1. We are to recognize and love the necessity of obstacles; appreciate our natural ability to confront and overcome it; seek the chance to prove and train ourselves, and find the humor and purpose granted by reversals.
   2. [Life as a “ball game”:](https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/stoicism-as-a-ball-game/) We seek to play with care and respect for other players, acknowledge their efforts to defeat us with calm, and exert ourselves fully with skill *and* neutrality towards the outcome.  A challenge to play well, not flip out. (1)
   3. *“Good men work, spend and are spent, and they do so willingly. Fortune does not drag them; they follow, and keep step.”* (Seneca, On Providence 5.4)
   4. *“This is no misfortune,; to bear it nobly, rather, is good fortune.”* (*Meditations* 4.49)
   5. “*And yet life, Lucilius, is really a battle. For this reason those who are tossed about at sea, who proceed uphill and downhill over toilsome crags and heights, who go on campaigns that bring the greatest danger, are heroes and front-rank fighters; but persons who live in rotten luxury and ease while others toil, are mere turtle-doves safe only because men despise them.”* (Seneca, *Moral Letters to Lucilius*, 96)  

4. [Stoic Joy](https://donaldrobertson.substack.com/p/three-sources-of-happiness-in-stoicism) —> It is in the activities of virtuous pursuit that we find cause to be joyful regarding our own virtue, the virtues of others, and joy in our lot in the world.
   1. We need not suppress our disappointments and frustrations, but rather recognize that they do not undermine the importance of virtuous action. With detachment and present-mindedness, they are easily endurable. 
   2. To the Stoic, virtue alone is sufficient for happiness under any circumstances. It is a rewarding experience to serve others, and enjoy exercising our ability to do so. We may find pleasure in acting out our natural function. 
   3. *“A man when he has done a good act, does not call out for others to come and see, but he goes on to another act, as a vine goes on to produce again the grapes in season.”* (Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations* 5.6)
   4. *""...Happiness is not supposed to be the Stoic goal, not even covertly. The Stoic view, rather, is that one should embrace virtue for its own sake, and that doing so is necessary to get the good side effects of it.""* (Ward Farnsworth, *The Practicing Stoic*, 209)  
 

Thanks for reading! Happy to discuss in the comments as usefully as I am able (fate permitting ;). 

Also, if you have any good articles on how challenges *develop* virtue, please share them and I'll add them to this post -- it seems like a major theme for [Seneca](https://www.stoicinsights.com/senecas-death-and-the-transformation-of-adversity/) and [Epictetus](https://academyofideas.com/2019/02/psychology-of-resilience/) to my mind, but most articles I found focused on philosophical coping mechanisms rather than Stoic virtue creation.

How do I stop expecting things from people/the world?,"I’m very much new to stoicism, I’ve started reading the important texts but I haven’t gotten very deep yet.

Also I’m aware that some people here are bothered by relationship drama stuff, but here I’m just using it as the most convenient and relevant example.

My partner of 5 years left me for someone else. I haven’t been the perfect partner for her, but I supported her through many trials, made sacrifices for the relationship, etc. Obviously given how she left me for someone else and wasn’t very kind or caring towards me through the break-up process. Regardless of how much I understand how it’s irrational to expect her to treat me more “fairly” and be more grateful for the things I did and sacrificed for her throughout our relationship, deep down I can’t help but do expect it from her and be upset that she did not. Of course this is just one example, as since getting more into stoicism I noticed how much I expect from people and the world and how much energy and words I waste being upset at things/people not turning out how I would want them to. I tell myself and the rational “part” of my brain understands that it’s foolish to wish for a fig in winter. But deeper inside my soul I still cry out for the fig. I’m not sure how stoics are able to rewire themselves to stop wishing for it. Are there exercises for this specifically?

Any help would be appreciated, thank you.",Stoicism,1702718739.0,t3_18jnmtf,0.91,9

How Would a Stoic Deal With a Conservative Religious Family?,"Hi all, I'm a 21 Y.O. living in the UK.  


Roughly 3 years ago, I accepted to myself that I am no longer a Muslim, but rather an agnostic. I kept this hidden from my family, even when they knew that I had a lot of doubts and questions concerning Islam. They demand that I pray all 5 of my daily prayers with them, that I attend religious classes and that I cut ties with any non-religious friends that I may have.  


Fast-forward to today. I have a decent paying job, I have a tenancy agreement for an apartment that I can move into within the next month, and there's a lot of tension that's hard to avoid between my family and I. I believe that moving out will help in raising my self-esteem and my ability to be honest with my parents. They're worried that I'll condemn myself to hell if I don't work on increasing my knowledge when it comes to Islam, and that me considering moving out is a sign that I'm looking to part ways with my family. I've tried to ease their worries by telling them that I'd visit every weekend or so and that my main reason for moving out is to commute into work easier, but all I'm met with are tears, scoldings and guilt-tripping. 

Their actions are understandable. I've told them that I still share their faith, even if I have tons of doubts. They believe that the doubts will only go away once I've submitted myself to god and worked on gaining knowledge in Islam. But the truth is, I have no intention of exploring Islam. I don't want to live the double-life wherein I pretend to be someone I'm not around my family. I understand that telling my family that I'm no longer Muslim could lead to shunning and disownment , but I recognize that this is something I'll have to do. 

I'm feeling a lot of pressure from my siblings, which i find incredibly troubling to deal with. I'm not sure how I can deal with the accusations that I'm causing my parents a lot of suffering, and that It's within my best interests to work on fulfilling their criteria (spending more time with family, going to prayers more often, etc) before moving out. What I haven't told them is that the stress of having to put up a facade around them has lead to me isolating myself from the family. My siblings hold me responsible for my parent's sadness, and that I should forget about the tenancy agreement for the apartment and never bring it up with my parents again.

I'm unsure of what to do next. Part of me believes that I should notify my parents that I've signed the tenancy agreement, move out and then work on telling my family that I'm agnostic. Part of me sees that me bringing it up would only cause pain and more tension, so therefore I shouldn't tell them and I should work on moving out without them noticing.  


What would your stoic tips be for dealing with a situation like this? Would it be acceptable for me to lie about not signing the tenancy agreement to avoid conflict? 

*(TL;DR: Left Islam. Now living a double-life around family. Unsure if I should tell my family that I've decided to move out)*

My logic for ending it,"I have really screwed up life for me and my partner.

I think the only way to help her and this child is to take myself out of the picture.  I have some savings and I could leave it all to her and the kid to use.  It could last them a few years.

On Anger,"We all get angry, and stoics would argue that it's how we control that emotion is the important part. But I read this quote and it hit me as a connection I had never made before: ""Anger is an emotional response to an unfulfilled expectation."" I realized how true that was - that when I felt anger it was because something was not happening the way I felt it should.

However this then begged the question: ""So do we then not have any expectations, if we don't want to feel anger?"" Not very realistic, and nihilistic really, which I don't think is any real way to live, but! If you have 0 expectations for anyone or anything then you no longer deal with anger.

So then is it better to temper expectations AND control the emotion of anger?

But if the goal is to \*feel\* less anger; then simply controlling it, isn't really the answer either. I apologize for my rambling - I'm just trying to write down what has been rolling around in my head for the last little bit.

How stoics deals with racism?,"I come from oppressed community in India, Chamar, we are untouchables or Dalits, we're still treated like trash in my country. I want to do good things for the people not just for mine but for everyone. But the criticism and everything stops me and makes me anxious.

Although I haven't experienced discrimination directly. But I read it online about growing violence against our community. I have experienced it indirectly a lot. I tried to be best for my whole life and I succeeded in that too, I topped my school and college. People say that I am mediocre Dalit and that whatever I get is because of reservations (which is a special law for giving equal opportunity for oppressed communities, by allowing equal representation of people in education and other areas, like affirmative action). Think of Jews living in ghettos during ww2 Germany (I don't mean to offend anyone nor I am associating with worst tragedy in history, it's just the growing violence scares me and I can resonate with that event). Because of this and reading about violence, I hardly talk to anyone because I am scared to be out in public. I stopped going out for dates and asking out many years ago, cuz I am afraid that it will end badly and no one wants to get married and associated with a ""Dalit"". I am too scared of achieving my goals because everything in India is based on casteism, I may not find a house on rent because my caste. It's just bad here.

I used to lie in school about my caste.

Even though it happened it hasn't turned me into a bitter person. I respect every individual and empathize with others. I control my anger nor do I argue with someone who calls me names or makes fun of my community and call us scums. It's just that I am scared to do anything. Because if I achieve something in life I will be known as ""Dalit boy who... achieved something"" not a ""College boy who... achieved something"" or ""Engineering student who... achieved something""

If I have to do something I have to stay in limits because that may exploit my caste and people will bash my family for this reason.

Stoicism as an ever evolving philosophy,"In my mind, stoicism must evolve and change with the times to remain relevant. Marcus Aurelius, one of the most quoted and beloved stoic thinkers would most likely not fit the mold of how we think of stoics today. Despite being a man that pursued virtue as the highest importance he owned slaves. Would owning a slave today fit our judgment of what it means to be Just, one of the touchstones of stoic philosophy? I certainly hope not! People are a product of their time and their experiences. Times change and our notion of what it means to be just, temperate, wise and courageous must change with them.",Stoicism,1702626242.0,t3_18iuv7w,0.79,8
Marcus Aurelius teaches to not complain; I kinda disagree.,"The quote goes ""Don't be overhead complaining... not even to yourself"" -Marcus Aurelius, 8.9.  

Complaining is all about emotional expression. when an emotion is dominating your mind it becomes easy to become hopeless, and feel like you cannot fix the problem. When you vent out this emotion (complaining is an easy way to do that), it allows your brain to operate clearly and it removes that burden from your mind. So id wager it's more beneficial to complain in moderation than to not most of the time. Also, from my experience it's a great ice breaker, an easy way to relate to other people, and often doesn't come off as annoying.

Stoic advice for the probable loss of a pet?,"I've been reading about stoicism for about a year now and its had a huge impact on my mental health, however recently my ability to put it to use has been tested to say the least. 

This may seem trivial compared to other peoples problems, but I have a young cat (soon to be five y/o) who I may lose in the near future. He has a condition he has to be medicated for and this medication has a long list of probable side effects, the biggest one being another illness where I have decided that I would rather put him down than make him go through that treatment.

This is not a 100% certanity, but it is indeed a very probable risk and I cannot stop worrying, waiting and bracing myself for the heartache of having to decide to let him go. I have had more time than many others have gotten and I try to be thankful for this and to appreciate each day instead of thinking about the next, but this is constantly on my mind and I feel so sad and anxious about it.

Seeing things just as they are,"Hello everybody. 
Lately I've been advancing in my studies of Stoicism and I've come to a realization, more of the development of a skill actually. Lately I have been able to see things the way they are. What do I mean by this?

Someone says an insult. Is it good? Bad? It was just an insult, or more radically, just words that were cataloged negatively by us.

Someone outplayed you? They just did a certain action. Now it is up to you to cataloge it in a way.
 
Do you feel frustration? It was just a feeling that makes you stay alert and feel weird things, not necessarily bad. 

After meditating on this new skill that I have been developing, I was very confused how should I use it in a way that is constructive, for the Virtue, for the community and for my path. Now I realize that insults are starting to lose meaning for me, therefore they start to mean less and less, it's just words, and now I feel some kind of power, like ""I can do whatever I want with that insult"". Destructive behaviors, the same. I have been gradually overcoming that confusion through Stoic ethics, at least the few I've studied about it. I decide to use this for what I judge to be good, the justice, for the community, for my learning and development path. It is interesting. Have any of you experienced this before?

Antipater,"I see a lot of people seeking advice so I thought I would switch things up with some food for thought. Stoicism seems to be perceived as an all or nothing philosophy that encourages us to not feel and discourages us when we fall short. This doesn’t have to be the case. Antipater, the 6th leader of the stoic school formed by Zeno, took the philosophy in another direction than his predecessors by loosening some of the absolutist rules that had been laid before him. Early stoics held that all sins were wrong and equal. Antipater rejected this notion recognizing that stealing a loaf of bread is not the same as murdering the baker for the bread. In Lives of the Stoics, by Stephen Hanselman and Ryan Holiday, they compare the modern stoic to an archer. “We train and practice. We draw back the arrow and aim it to the best of our abilities. But we know full well that despite our training and our aim, many factors outside our control will influence where the arrow hits the target-or if it falls short entirely. We take action. But much happens after that-much of it is not remotely up to us. Which is why we know that our true worth does not reside in whether or not we get a bullseye.”  I thought that was a fitting analogy. Something to think on, something I wanted to share.",Stoicism,1702600428.0,t3_18inafj,0.67,5
Should I be always trying to think if I did the most virtue thing that I could?,"I was thinking about that: Should I be, after all actions, thinking about them and questioning myself if it was the best action i could take or should I simply focus on trying to take the best action and later on on the day, maybe evening, I stop and think about that while journaling or meditating, and focusing the judgment of my action on this period of the day? That came to my mind because a lot of times I end up being caught on my own thoughts in the mid of the day trying to judge some action of mine and this leads to more untoughtful actions.

Having trouble reading Epictetus,"Hi,

I've read The Meditations (and loved it) so I wanted to see what Epictetus had to say as well. I got to about chapter 18 (or I18?) in book 1 and honestly I'm just confused at this point. 

I understand the Discourses are, well, discourses and not really a book written by Epictetus himself, but still I find his arguments being rather confusing and messy. Not very clear. 

For example: Chapter, 17, is titled ""concerning the necessity of logic"" (I got the penguin classics edition). Epictetus starts by presenting a problem/paradox - reason can only be analyzed either by itself or by something superior, however ""there is nothing superior to reason"" and reason cannot analyze itself because it creates an endless loop. Then he goes on to address a claim (hypothetical or from someone in the audience? i'm not sure) saying that regardless, emotions are more important than logic, only to show that it isn't the case and that no debate could be held with rules set by emotions.

So, he says, we use logic to define the terms in which we analyze things and discuss among ourselves (but how is that related to the paradox at the begging?). Then he goes on to argue against another claim against logic and then he ends up with talking about understanding nature, some victim of something unclear and then God and a philosopher's power of interpretation.

Of course it's much more complicated but I tried to keep it short XD

So as you can see, this is what I got from this chapter. Honestly I don't understand what he was trying to say and it's the same in most of the other chapters. He seems a bit all-over-the-place for me.

I wanted to know if other readers faced the same problem or is it just me? Is he getting clearer in following chapters? Maybe you could give me tips on how to read Epictetus, maybe I'm missing something?

"If emotions seem to be a natural result of the body, why are we trying to control them so much?","There's a concept in stoicism that we should control that which we can, and accept those things which we cannot.  But can we really control the fact we feel emotions?  I've never met anyone who doesn't experience them, and personally they feel very instant and inevitable.  It seems like to me, I have an inevitable emotion, and then a controllable, separate, external reaction to it.

To me, once I'm already feeling an emotion, it makes it much worse to try and suppress it.  So I kind of just give myself permission to feel whatever naturally comes.  Letting myself be okay with not being okay is deeply liberating and has really been centering to me emotionally, but it seems this isn't the majority consensus on the stoic treatment of emotions, and me admitting to others I'm feeling certain emotions isn't stoic at all.  But when I do this, I feel much more calm and controlled, and the emotions I do have are smaller on the outside.

So I wanted to ask if there's an appropriately stoic way to see this.  I've been reading Epictetus and so far nothing in the enchiridion goes against what I'm saying.  But it seems this is not the common interpretation of the content, and that most have a concept of a stoic being a sort of iceman/woman

I'm interested to see what others think about this, so I thought I would ask.",Stoicism,1702565145.0,t3_18ia6v6,0.87,21
Ignorant about my own possessions?,"I don't know. Epictetus calls it superfluous to recieve land, money and a magisterial office when we all naturally posses their equivalent. Calls it an act of someone ignorant of their own possessions.

Regarding receiving(from oneself) Greatness of soul(whatever this means) and generosity of spirit(like feeding your mind a good book or spending time in the company of someone you consider wise), what  Stoic practices come to mind, that make it easy to consider land, money and a magisterial office unnecessary?, taking into consideration the things neccessary to human life that money provides.",Stoicism,1702583413.0,t3_18igzfb,1.0,7
Being ok with saying goodbye,"My parents are seperated but they’re both alcoholics. My dad is worse, he lost his great career like 8 years ago, lost a few jobs after that, been to detox over 5 times in the past 5 years but he keeps going back to drinking. 

I moved from one place back to my hometown to help him and hopefully get him clean, at this point I’m over it. He’s getting kicked out of his place soon and I’m heading back across the country to finally focus on my own life. I always felt like I have to go out of my way to parent my parents but I’ve delayed my own career and life for them. 

When I move I don’t plan to come back, unless to visit. Leaving means, like everyday, he (or anybody in the world) may pass. I feel like I’ve tried what I can do but he needs to fix himself as we all do. My parents were great when I was growing up then fell down these dark holes when I entered adulthood. If they were terrible parents I could leave easier and never look back.

"""There is nothing fearful in nature for the rational man""","I've come across this quote in a lecture about Marcus Aurelius ( Michael Sugrue). Quotes like this and others

""He who fears death will never do anything worth of a man who is alive"" - Seneca.

underscore  the paralyzing effect of fear. I often find myself hesitating to do stuff held back by the uncertainty and anxiety surrounding the unknown, so by fear. Most of these fears are irrational. Quotes like this remind that life is meant to be lived and always avoiding things u fear kills u in a metaphorical sense. And if worse comes to worst injury, death or other losses are all just part of nature and therefore not anything to be afraid of.

Anyone else share this experience?

My mind goes nuts over a choice that I didn't have,"I want to embrace stoicism, but my mind keeps pointing me back to my ""old"" ways. 

This is the weirdest most recent example: 
I recently started a new job. Part of that was getting a company car. Normally you'd order one from the 3 choices the company has for you, these are mainly the cheapest versions of cars. With the push to ev's however this means I can only choose electric cars. We already have one ev at home and like an ice car as backup, so my only option is getting one from the company pool. 

I had two choices: a few months old ford focus or a 3 years old Opel Astra. I obviously went for the Ford, added bonus is that when i do have to pick an EV i can pick a more matured one. 

Now I have a colleague who was fortunate and could choose one of the last Ice cars. He went for the new Opel Astra. Turns out that basic Astra is way more luxurious than my Ford albeit a bit more expensive. 

My mind now constantly goes into ""what if"" mode. Because of course, my mind believes the new Opel is the better choice. I believe this goes back to my constant persuit of perfection. If i have choices, no matter what they are about, u always try to go for the best and very best one. 

Tl;dr:
My mind is contemplating over a choice I didn't even have. Stoicism tells me that all I have control over is my own judgement, yet my mind can't stop overthinking this. What to do? 

And yes, I know this is a first world problem. I'm happy with the car and very fortunate, but I also want to make clear that I do pay for it.",Stoicism,1702547760.0,t3_18i59ss,0.62,3
A stoic perspective on the irreplaceable,"My Dad passed away suddenly this year. First and foremost he was an amazing father with a deep sense of duty and community. He was a well respected Jungian psychologist both in his practice and as a professor. He was a role model in the relationship he shared with my mom and a man that practiced what he preached. He has been the most influential person in my life.

I’m posting this in hope that someone else may find value in my reflections on how stoicism influenced my thoughts around his passing. 

————

When we accept that we have been deprived of something we once had, our next logical instinct is to choose one of the following courses of action: find it, replace it, or do without it.

When something irreplaceable is taken, we cannot find it again because it exists nowhere else. We cannot replace it, as that is the definition of irreplaceable. Then, we are seemingly left with only one option: to do without. What may seem as the lesser of three outcomes is the most beautiful. 

When we accept the nature of what was given back as irreplaceable we can only choose to do without. Once that choice is made we can be at peace with what was given back. We no longer struggle to find what we had again or recreate it. Accepting that we will never have what we had ever again is not a lamentation, it is a testament to how beautiful and special it was. 

We must see ourselves as artists and what is gone as our work of art. We may enjoy creating the work, admire its shape as it takes form, and even the struggle to make it beautiful. The complete and refined beauty of our work can only be seen after we are finished with it. Our appreciation for what we created is deepened when we know every step that formed it.

We shouldn’t look back at what we had and wish we still had it. We now have the privilege to look back on it as completed. We get to admire how beautiful our journey with it was from start to finish. Our focus is on how grateful we are that fate allowed us to have something so precious at all, regardless of duration. 

It’s the rarest joy to give back something that cannot be replaced.

"A short review, and a question, regarding unearned wisdom in the modern era. Would love to hear your thoughts.","UNEARNED WISDOM IN THE MODERN ERA

Growing up and living in the modern era provides a unique experience, compared to our ancestors’, in respect to the accessibility of information. In a world where we are more interconnected than ever before, we are blessed to have instant and untethered access to knowledge and information in mere seconds, through use of the internet.

Lessons that once took a near lifetime to learn can be easily accessed by keyboard. Endless archives of wisdom, built upon through the ages, as a result of hard work and discipline, hand us the opportunity to learn and grow on a silver platter.

Herein the problem lies, many of us are constantly looking outwards for answers, or worse yet, outsourcing a sense of purpose and growth, subcontracting the hard work and toil required to gain such wisdom, and condensing said effort into mere seconds, leaving us overstimulated, desensitised, and none-the-wiser.

Knowledge, without practical application, is almost useless. That is, unless your goal is to *sound* like someone who has their life together. But actions speak louder than words, and eventually these pseudo-sages will demonstrate their lack of self control.

So, then the question remains, how do you pick the low-hanging fruit of the modern day world, and turn it into actual, practical wisdom?

Wisdom can be defined as *‘the quality of having experience, knowledge and good judgement’.*

In order to reach good judgement, we must first possess the knowledge, which can be unlocked through the experience.

Here is a step-by-step process for effectively gaining accurate wisdom through experience:

**Step One**

A certain event will happen, which has a significant outcome, either expected or not. The more intensely positive, or negative, the experience is, the more valuable information there may be to learn, and the higher levels of emotion that may be produced as a by-product.

**Step Two**

Reflection on the experience, if possible including the ability to compare it to others, the vision to explore other possible outcomes, creating knowledge. Reflection must come from an emotionally stable perspective, otherwise it can distort the lesson which remains to be learned.

For example, a start-up business which fails, losing a lot of money, will be a highly emotional event, but inside will be a treasure trove of knowledge and experience, which could undoubtedly help in the future.

Concerning pearls of wisdom, it should be known, that in order to claim the precious gemstone from the tightly clasped oyster, your fingers will get sore and bloodied in the process.

If the event is reviewed from an emotionally driven perspective, the person involved may say: “I knew my colleagues were right, I am not cut out to be a businessman, I should have just stayed in my previous job.”

But this does not give much, if any, useful feedback. It just provides an emotional reasoning as to why the event unfolded this way, rather than a logical situational report which can better guide us in the future.

And this kind of emotional response is not only negatively-based, for example if the same new business was instantly a huge success, perhaps the emotionally driven reflection would be: “I am so great at opening businesses. I must have the golden touch!” – creating a false sense of genius in oneself, leading to overreaching and under-preparing later on.

In order to be successful and accurate in your reflection of events, you must be emotionally removed. This can take time, to detach yourself from the immediacy of the situation, but necessary in order to have an impartial perspective.

**Step Three**

The ability to judge new situations, and modify choices or behaviour based on the knowledge gained from previous experience, thus defining wisdom.

In order to be able to draw on such knowledge, like in the previous step, you must begin with an emotionally stable frame-of-mind. With a higher risk or reward relying on the outcome of the event in question, the situation will become more emotionally charged, making emotional detachment more difficult, creating a reaction, rather than an action.

With this step-by-step of earning wisdom through experience, the question stands. Not all those who are experienced are wise, but is it possible to become wise without experience? How do you absorb the wisdom of lessons which you haven’t lived yourself?",Stoicism,1702468375.0,t3_18hf56u,0.57,1
The concept of virtue is circular,"Stoics advocate for following virtue, but what how might one define what is virtuous? A stoic would respond: ""that which results in your contentment/ what is in your nature.""

The Stoic would reply: ""That which uses the right reason""  


And on and on the circular reasoning goes. Without defining what contentment is or what the right reason is, this is a never ending circle and doesn't mean anything.   


Another counterargument: that which is just, wise, moderate and courageous is what makes you content.   


The skeptic would reply ""Why are those things virtues and not something else?"" And there is no answer.   


Finally, a Stoic might say something like: ""That which is good for you is the right use of reason""  


The skeptic would reply: ""But you just said that the only thing good for me is the right use of reason. If the only thing that is good is reason, then why is what is good for you the right use of reason? In other words, doing what is good is the right use of judgement, but you haven't actually defined what is good. Without defining what is good, then what makes it a good judgement?"" As you can see, there is circular reasoning once again.

If someone could clear up these counterarguments, that would be greatly appreciated. ",Stoicism,1702415807.0,t3_18gwn2c,0.83,11
How much mental energy or thought process does practicing Stoicism take up?,"BTW: I wasn't sure if I should be putting this in the ""New to Stoicism"" or in ""Seeking Stoic Advice"" - I've only been interested in Stoicism as a means for dealing with my own circumstances for the past year or so.

For some context: I struggle with the actual practicing of Stoicism, mostly due to having ADHD (mostly the Inattentive type).  Despite trying to work on it, I can often find the impulsive nature of my mind engages way too quickly.  If I'm in a 'hyperfocused' state regarding Stoicism, I can manage that a little better - but the effort it seems to take mentally is exhausting.

So:

I don't think I've seen this discussed - but how much time and effort is spent mentally going over the practice of being Stoic?  I am aware in CBT there are often things like half-hour daily exercises, but these are really more transformative things that are designed to work over longer periods.  To me, Stoicism is more a 'way of life' kind of philosophy and thinking - reacting to and interpreting situations and circumstances constantly.

That constant examination and practice seems exhausting to me.  I'm the kind of person who can become mentally exhausted after doing a client meeting, or having a slightly busier day, or just one of those days where my brain decides to inner monologue about anything and everything constantly.  Add to that all the little rules I have to follow otherwise I'll lose things, forget things and generally mess my day up horribly.  I often have to force myself to mono-task and try to keep focus even doing a simple thing like making a cup of tea or a sandwich.

This is all compounded by my seeing this quote of Epictetus: ""Don't explain your philosophy.  Embody it."" when I've been searching for some kind of guidance.  To me, to embody something is to take it on completely, utterly - it becomes ***everything***.

I guess alternatively - what is a good balance of applying Stoic principles in your mind over just letting things flow naturally to see how well the practices are taking hold? 

(In my life, and mind, if I'm not actively thinking about a process, then that process can very much not exist at all.  So coming into a situation where I *could* practice a Stoic principle, I'll forget that I can and instead do something else, and on reflection, something worse.)

I hope this makes sense, it's really hard for me to put down into words exactly what I'm trying to get across (and I'm sure I've probably missed some obvious point I should have made lol).",Stoicism,1702425079.0,t3_18h1dcc,0.72,6

Stoicism for giving birth,"
I'm going to be giving birth in a few weeks. What advice does Stoic philosophy have for me? Has anyone on here faced this experience and found Stoic perspectives helpful?

I plan to use pain medication in combination with other coping techniques - I find it most helpful personally to think of childbirth as lying along the spectrum of human experience that we can bring the resources of humanity (modern medicine!) to bear against, rather than a primal/natural event that my body will handle in a way separate from other parts of my life. (Dying is also part of the human experience, and people with a choice in the matter rarely form a goal of ""getting through it without unnatural interventions."") But I also understand that people feel many ways about this topic, and have a great admiration for people who pursue an unmedicated delivery - please don't make this post into a war about which of these approaches is ""more Stoic.""

Even though I expect to get an epidural, the education and medical advice I've gotten are consistent in recommending to delay epidurals until fairly late in the game (or at least it seems late to me) to avoid slowing labor. Epidurals can also fail or turn out to be unavailable for a variety of reasons. So I know I'm in for ??? hours of steadily increasing discomfort and pain, in an altered mental and hormonal state I haven't experienced before.  I also have never had my pain tolerance tested to an extreme degree, and know that pain tolerance and the experience of what labor feels like varies hugely. 

I vacilate between using voluntary discomfort as opportunities to practice not-suffering, and trying not to borrow worry/suffering from the future by going too nuts with it. I hold a lot of ice cubes and long yoga poses, and have access to good resources for specific mental management techniques for handling contractions.

Stoic perspectives have been very helpful to me during pregnancy, both for pregnancy symptoms (treatable and untreatable) and for thinking about upcoming labor.  There is a lot I can't control both about things that are inevitable (pain) and things that are unknowable (what complications arise, if I have back labor or require other medical interventions, if my epidural fails) - and it's very freeing to realize this means that me ruminating about it won't change anything. 

I don't have a significant formal background in stoic philosophy, so I'd be grateful for both your own impressions as well as specific topics, concept names, or readings that might be relevant. I am interested in any male or female perspectives on this question, so long as they don't amount to ""women just have some kind of special sauce for going through childbirth and they forget it afterward!"" 

(This question is inspired by the ""voluntary discomfort"" post, and a look through the archives suggests there's only been a few posts on this topic ever. This is my 'pregnancy' reddit account and I'm a regular reader of r/Stoicism on my main account.)",Stoicism,1702386508.0,t3_18glhl9,0.86,23
Breakup Guilt,"Hello,

Six months ago my boyfriend left me. I was very emotional in the relationship, driven by my insecurities. This led him to cheat and then abandon me and cut contact completely. These last months, all I’ve been doing is playing a loop in my head hoping I would’ve done things differently and he’d still be here. I feel like I was abusive and it is haunting me. I learned so much and I’ll never be like that again, but I learned it after losing him. I’m filled with regret and constantly telling myself it was all my fault.

I’m struggling to understand the stoic texts,"Per this sub I started reading the Dialogues of Epictetus. I just finished chapter one of book one and am very confused. 

Some of his sentences make total sense to me, but others are very confusing. For example, it starts off with “Of all the faculties, you will find not one which is capable of contemplating itself; and, consequently, not capable either of approving or disapproving.“ This just leaves me confused. What are all the faculties? He then gives the example of grammatic art and music as faculties that can’t contemplate themselves. And the “rational faculty” as the only one that can. I’m confused what specifically this even is.

Why should the Stoic not be self indulgent?,"Hello all,

I am reading through Meditations for the first time and early on he mentions that one thing he learned from his adopted father was not to be too self indulgent and he admired that he had, “no concern for food, or the cut and color of his clothes, or having attractive slaves.”

My understanding is that stoicism teaches us how to better handle adversity and how to carry yourself in a way that others can respect. I don’t understand why caring about how you present yourself would negatively impact the Stoic. 

I agree that flaunting wealth or the material possessions you have as being anti stoic but I don’t see how private self indulgence is.",Stoicism,1702397545.0,t3_18gpgx6,0.71,7
How do you practice not trying to get stressed out about things out of your control? Is that missing the point?,"I have a bumpy relationship with my mother. She frequently burns bridges with people and is generally negative and depressing to be around. She burned a bridge with my fiance last year, and generally has a bad relationship with my sister. This xmas we will all be spending it in separate locations (which is fine with me given the situation) but my mom is being super negative about it because she believes the 24th is ""her"" time to have us at her house. Long story short, shes tough to be around and pushes people away but still wants us to spend time with her.

I called her today to invite her to our house for xmas, since my sister would be away and I know my mom has no one else to spend xmas with (other than her husband and his family). She says she will be spending xmas with them and goes on a low key rant about how we won't be with her and how we don't want to go over to her house anymore, etc. I even tell her that we will plan to all be at her house next year, and she replies with ""yeah if im even alive next year"". Like, that is some straight up emotional abuse right there lol.

I dreaded calling her. I had anxiety thinking about the conversation. This is not right. I am not making any rash decisions because of this, in part thanks to stoicism. I understand this is out of my control and that I cannot change how she feels/acts/talks. The thing I don't like is still being stressed out about it. The dread. The anxiety. Am I missing the point of stoicism if I'm still trying to figure out how to remove those emotions?",Stoicism,1702417615.0,t3_18gxd92,0.67,2
"Social media toxicity, R/vegan, and what should I do.","So I am recently new to Reddit, again. I was on reddit back in  2012 to 2014, but stopped until this year. I like how Reddit is mostly more positive, especially compared to the toxicity of Facebook. 
I have found great communities from books, dogs, satellite radio fans, to philosophy.
But something recently left a bad taste in my mouth. I am vegetarian and try mostly for a vegan diet due to my morality with animals. Not preaching this is just my personal beliefs, but I feel this is important information for the story.
So anyways I also joined R/vegan.
I posted a few times on the subreddit and recently I posted an article entitled ""Veganism is in crisis, and the fanatics can only blame themselves"" and asked what the people what they thought of the criticism. Just because I was curious. I did not write the article.
But I would say about 40% to 45% started to attack me personally or my online persona I guess.
I like to think I have tuff skin and shit posters and trolls don't bother me, but this time it kind of did.
I was just asking what people thoughts were and to start a discussion. I didn't give my opinion of the article and I have been posting on the board for awhile. 
But almost half of them seemed mad at me, I tried to defend myself, but they didn't seem to care. After a few responses I realized I was just wasting my time and deleted my post and blocked a few people. 
I had my wife look at the post and she says it did not look offensive or anything like that, but I do admit she could be biased.
I was really starting to like Reddit with the discussions. But R/vegan makes me question if I should give up social media in general. I don't know. 
I like the discussions, but I am getting to old to deal with shit posters all the time. I am not sure if this was a one time fluke, a vegan thing (I am not unrealistic, I know how they can be sometimes), a reddit thing, or just people...

Stoicism - Reading the news or not?,"I've been involved with stoicism for about a year now. Reading books, listening to podcasts, watching videos etc. I feel like I have successfully applied rules and values to my life. I am definitely less angry, my short temper is gone, I'm able to smile more, I accept things for who or what they are, I generally feel better etc.

Recently, I had had a discussion with a friend of mine. He isn't as involved in stoicism, but he knows what it is and it's core values.

He asked me about an event that happened in the world, and I told him I wasn't aware of it, because I don't read the news. He asked why, and I told him that the news make me angry, thus I avoid it. Although, I still read news I find interesting that doesn't upset me, like technology and some entertainment news.

He told me that he can read the news and not get angry, and stay neutral regardless of what he's reading. That's definitely not me. The news themselves, and how the media stirs the pot and presents the news, it's a breeding ground for anger. So I avoid it, and in return I'm happier, with the blowback of not staying as informed about the world (which can be a blessing and a curse).

My friend told me that a TRUE stoic, would be able to read any news and stay neutral, and me avoiding the news isn't what a stoic person should do. A stoic person should block out external things while staying informed. He argued that I should train myself to read the news, whatever it is, and stay neutral.

This intrigued me. It felt like a superpower. But me training myself by reading negative news, and forcing myself to stay neutral, sounds awful. I mean, how long would that take?

But first let's get the definition down here. Local news headline: 8-year-old girl sexually assaulted by 3 men. Alright… Do I smash things around me? No. But I carry this news with me in the back of my head, and it's there, making me angrier than I should have been if I didn't read it. It can affect my entire day.

I don't see how a person could read that and stay neutral? In fact, that out right sounds like a psychopath.

What do you think?

EDIT: So many incredible comments. I wasn't expecting to get so dwelled down into stoic theory. This was great. 

Based on a lot of your comments as well as stoic theory, I'm guessing my friend is correct. However, flooding myself with negatiity just to stay informed about world events; isn't something I see as something good. 

Also important to mention is the fact that one news article doesn't upset me, or make me angry, despite the original post making it look like that. I'm talking about watching and reading general media news on a daily basis, and over months or years building a negative mindset. I can read a bad piece of news and brush it off. Should have made that more clear from the start.

I've been heavily informed, and I have been heavily uninformed (current state), and based on my mood and life in general, I prefer to be uninformed. Not MISINFORMED, but UNINFORMED. Reading up in current local news is a good thing. Reading up what happens on the other side of the world does no longer interest me.

However in modern day, eating meat isn't a requirement to live a healthy life, and the mass production of meat is widely thought to be inefficient and cruel, so using reason and the information we have available, eating meat wouldn't be the virtuous choice.

I've just been thinking about this lately, and thought there was a bit of a clash between our nature and our ability to reason in this area. There's probably more stuff like this as the modern world is so different to what was going on back when Marcus was knocking about.",Stoicism,1702292647.0,t3_18fs32u,0.54,8
One major change and some minor changes to the subreddit,"Howdy, we have decided on the small handful of changes described below.

\- **The New Agora**  
In order to better ensure that users seeking Stoic advice receive well-informed, specifically Stoic responses, we have decided to make a major change in the subreddit. Posts with the ""Seeking Stoic Advice"" flair will now be considered as seeking specifically and recognizably Stoic advice. Users who are seeking and offering personal opinions inspired by Stoicism, sharing experiences that may be influenced by Stoicism, or requesting and attempting to administer ""[first aid](https://modernstoicism.com/two-types-of-stoic-therapy-by-john-sellars/)"" will be welcome to do so in the New Agora, a daily pinned thread for these and other types of exchanges (including, for example, casual questions users don't want create posts for and extremely limited self-promotion). The New Agora is not an anything-goes thread; instead, it is for things that may be more tangentially, rather than directly, Stoic. Activity that is way off-base remains unwelcome.  
If your ""Seeking Stoic Advice"" post is removed because you are seeking personal opinions or asking what-would-you-do questions, you may instead post in the New Agora. 

\- **User flairs**  
In the interest of improving communication, we have decided to implement user flairs. In order to receive a user flair, message the moderators with your request. Pending our consensus, informed by our review of your activity, our background knowledge, and/or other factors, we will assign the flair and it will appear beside your username when you are active here. You may apply for flairs in accordance with the most suitable descriptors of your experience or interest. For example, flairs may include ""qualified/trustworthy user,"" ""academic/scholar,"" or ""προκόπτων."" The moderators may also decide to grant flairs to users on their own, without applications in mod messages, pending the user's agreement.

\- **Post flairs**  
As mentioned, the ""Seeking Stoic Advice"" flair is now strictly for seeking well-informed advice strictly drawing from and clearly aligned with Stoic philosophy.The ""Stoic Theory/Study"" flair will now only be assigned by moderators. If you would like to use this flair on your post, use the ""Pending Theory/Study"" flair. This will flag our attention, and we will review your post to determine whether to assign the ""Stoic Theory/Study"" flair. This is intended to prevent the misuse of the flair that is primarily meant for longform, well-informed, and careful posts, rather than pop-philosophy-type content, short personal observations, and newcomer questions.

Things may change, but we are going to move forward and monitor how well things work. If you have any questions, concerns, or other feedback, feel free to let us know.

What are some modern stoic texts you can recommend?,"When I was in 7th grade I read “The seven habits of highly effective people.” I didn’t know it at the time, but that was my first exposure to many of the stoic principles. A couple years later I read “Man’s search for meaning” and that book deeply moved me and taught me so much about the core of stoicism. In 11th grade I read “The Tao of Pooh” and used that book as a my personal spiritual guidebook until I discovered stoicism. When I was introduced to stoicism by the book “a guide to the good life” I felt like I had found a way of living that brought together the fundamental principles that had inspired and spoken to me throughout my life. I still consider myself very new to stoicism as it has only been a year and half since I started seriously studying it. Even so, one of my favorite things to do is to look for parallels in the works of the ancient stoics and that of other books I read, especially fiction. 

What are some modern (as in post enlightenment) texts that you find to be deeply stoic texts? Not stoic commentaries, but actual stand alone projects that teach or demonstrate the principles found within stoicism?",Stoicism,1702252449.0,t3_18fh1r1,0.95,35

Does stoic philosophy provide a justification for the holocaust?,"Good day all, I have this question that I have not been able to google and am keen to hear your opinions. That is, how would a stoic look at the holocaust? Epictetus says ""Things that are not within our own power, not without our Will, can by no means be either good or evil"". So if you were someone within the concentration camp, would you say that the holocaust was neither good nor evil and embrace it? 

He also says ""until you know their reasons, how do you know they’ve acted wrongly"". And the same applies here, if you do not know why a nazi did what he did, how do we say it was wrong? Just because he had orders to kill someone, does not mean there were not anterior motives, motives we are not aware of. 

Please let me know what you think. This community is well more versed in stoic philosophy than I.

Ps. I am of course not trying to justify the holocaust. I am very intrigued by the application of stoic philosophy in the most, to our standards, dire and horrific of scenarios. ",Stoicism,1702379851.0,t3_18gjnav,0.23,0
Does anyone else struggle with feelings of sanctimony and an inflated ego with stoicism?,"Stoicism has helped my life massively, and because  of that I feel like it’s starting to inflate my ego. Anytime I find myself stroking my own ego, I try to bring myself back to reality.

I find arrogant/know it all people to be so incredibly cringe and obtuse, but I can’t help but start to feel that way about myself. Stoicism has changed my life in such a dramatic way, that I can’t help but feel like I know a secret to life that everyone else is ignorant to…and my ego insists on telling me I must be such a special snowflake for possessing the knowledge few others have. I find myself impulsively preaching to others about stoicism and I feel gross after the fact(I will gladly talk about it to those who like to talk philosophy, but others don’t care).


The rational part of me knows I’m not special, or better than anyone else…and I’d really like to develop a sense of natural humility to bring myself back to ground level.

Question about one’s own nature,"Hello,

I was contemplating about the fact that people can have their own ""natures"". For instance, I find that my nature is to provide for a family by having a job and loving/providing for them. Because of that, I studied and got a job to make that happen. 

I find my nature to be virtuous because I’m also serving society and whatnot, but then I thought I probably am biased in my line of thinking. 

I thought of a scenario where a person thinks that not working and not serving society is what nature demands of them due to any hypothetical reason (maybe they think society has failed them and that the right thing to do is to act against it). In that case, doing the opposite of what I thought was virtuous would become the virtuous thing to do for this person.

Is my thought on the right track? Or are there established guidelines for one’s nature to be virtuous? I thought of this after reminding myself of how Diogenes was praised by some stoic philosophers in some aspects (like in the famous banquet analogy).",Stoicism,1702266825.0,t3_18flmnz,0.72,3

Is this stoicism or something else? Vanity?,"Life is suffering. To engage in life's pleasures is to cause more greater suffering later in life. To the contrary, to allow yourself to suffer and deal with the suffering of life in the present, softens the suffering later in life.

Example. People go on vacation and blow thousands of dollars instead of working or investing that money. They buy temporary happiness, but end up slaving for money for more of their life. To the contrary, someone who does not partake in these types of temporary happiness, save money and invest and can become financially free and reduce their suffering later in life by embracing the hard work and discipline it takes to focus on what is important; in this case that is financial freedom.

"Self sufficiency over virtue, initially","I've been revisiting a piece in the Discourses http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0236%3Atext%3Ddisc%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D9,  and I know that ""self sufficiency is the greatest of all wealth"" is Epicurean(I think), and wealth is an indifferent in Stoicism?, but..

""..But a man may say, Whence shall I get bread to eat when I have nothing?""...""Wretch, if you have it, you will have it; if you have it not, you will depart from life...""

Somewhere in that section Epictetus calls some animals irrational and cowardly and then regards them at the same time for being self sufficient and living according to nature. I've heard that the success rate of a hunt for lions in our African wilderness is about 25% and many of them die from starvation. But when they succeed, they roar without reply and ravage without resistance.  I've also heard that tigers are pretty unremorseful. 

""...But we think about ourselves, as if we were only stomachs, and intestines, and shameful parts; we fear, we desire; we flatter those who are able to help us in these matters, and we fear them also...""

""..And shall it be necessary for one among us who is a philosopher to travel into foreign parts, and trust to and rely on others, and not to take care of himself, and shall he be inferior to irrational animals...""

It's coming off alittle like ""do it yourself, do what you have to do to survive..or atleast do what your nature requires in that given context because even actions which appear to be—and indeed are—immoral or unjust advance the overall design, which taken as a whole is harmonious and

Stoicism doesn’t account for the unvirtuous motivations of beneficial behavior,"Many criticisms of stoicism are based upon faulty logic or misunderstandings, but one criticism that has always stuck with me is stoicism seems to underestimate is the heavy influence of unvirtuous motivations to drive positive behaviour.

Stoicism emphasizes the importance of a proper perspective, and valuing virtue above all else. Typically it is seen as unvirtuous to allow your emotions to control you, to allow yourself to stress unnecessarily, or to pursue things like sex, status or ego. 

However, modern psychology indicates these are humanities strongest motivators.  Thus, the closer to a sage you become, the more you eliminate these motivators, and the less productive of a citizen you will become, which ends up defeating a large part of being stoic in the first place. 

You can argue: “To stoics the only thing that matters is you are virtuous.” Would it be virtuous to decline a method which allow you can help fellow man more? Is it not selfish to reject the ability to care more because it harms you more?",Stoicism,1702278563.0,t3_18fos0s,0.36,0

It's like...I'm ""running out of thoughts"".

EVERYTHING that happens is preordained,"I feel anxious. I have to give a presentation tomorrow and I feel anxious. But that's not what worries me. What worries me is the very fact that I am anxious. I have read meditations hundreds of times, I shouldn't feel this way. I should be armed with the thought that nothing in the universe can happen that is bad, because what the universe creates is guided by the laws of logic and cannot be anything but good.

The problem here is with the ""should"". You simultaneously say that the universe cannot give way to something that is bad but at the same time say that what is happening right now is wrong. The universe is wrong, in this case. Everything that the universe has so far created, the big bang, the birth of humanity, the rise of democracy, have been good and without mistake - until today. You being anxious is the universe's first mistake.

Of course this makes no sense. By ""everything that happens is good"" it follows that your anxiety has to be good. If tomorrow you should feel so anxious that you throw up, that is good. A central problem with this line of thinking has to do with expectation. ""I feel like I have done everything right so I shouldn't be feeling this way."" The hardest part, I think, is truly letting go of this expectation. We practice philosophy or spiritualism or religion because we want to be happy but often it is this goal that gets in the way of that happiness. You will still keep practicing, but remember that it is not up to you how things will go or how you will feel. Feeling bad can be a symptom of a problem that you should try to fix but it is not the feeling itself that you should try to fix or even bother with at all.

Edit: This post isn't about the damned presentation. I dont have anxiety about a presentation. I dont even have a presentation. This post was about the possivility of getting to hung up on ""it not working""/""I have read and taken notes on the discourses many times over""/""I have done everything correct"" and getting frustrated over your emotions persisting and your mind continuing to fluctuate. For the record I take full responsibility. I could definitily have phrased this post much better.

On descriptions and prescriptions,"**Introduction**

I’m sure everyone already intuitively knows the difference between prescriptions and descriptions, and can easily explain the difference when asked to. Yet quite often I see people on here struggle to apply this distinction in their Stoic practice.

In this post I will attempt to show this distinction in the context of practicing Stoicism and how one can practice more effectively by keeping it in mind.

**The difference**

The definitions of the words as per the Cambridge dictionary:

Prescription:

>the act of telling someone else what they must have or do.

Description:

>something that tells you what something or someone is like.

In my own understanding, a description is a list of characteristics that is associated with someone or something whereas a prescription is a list of instructions you can follow. We can easily *describe* how it is like for a master musician to play on an instrument, but to *prescribe* the training to attain such skills is a completely different thing.

In the context of training, a description tells you the goal that you wish to attain, and a prescription tells you the process towards  attaining that goal. In the causality chain of events, a description is the consequence and a prescription is an antecedent cause.

What this means is it makes sense to use prescriptions as your practice but not descriptions, and this is really where I see people struggle with.

Consider this simple example. If you sprain an ankle, the description of a “recovered ankle” is “you can run”. Do you then “run” with the sprained ankle so that you match the description of a “recovered ankle”? Of course not, we all have enough common sense to know this is ridiculous. What you do is ""following the doctor’s treatment plan”, or the “prescription”, until “you can run”, at which point you know you have “recovered” because what you can do matches the description. Being able to run is caused by having recovered, which in turn is caused by following the treatment plan.

But “running to recover” is exactly what people are doing when they say something along the lines of “I’m practicing Stoicism by not being disturbed by externals”, or “I’m following the Stoic principle of the cardinal virtues”. Not being disturbed by externals and the virtues are *descriptions* of a practiced Stoic, they are not *prescriptions* for your practice.

Epictetus himself talked about this in the following excerpt:

>But if he has striven merely to attain the state which he finds in his books and works only at that, and has made that the goal of his travels, I bid him go home at once and not neglect his concerns there, since the goal to which he has travelled is nothing; but not so that other goal—to study how a man may rid his life of sorrows and lamentations, and of such cries as ""Woe is me!"" and ""Wretch that I am!"" and of misfortune and failure, and to learn the meaning of death, exile, prison, hemlock; that he may be able to say in prison, ""Dear Crito, if so it pleases the gods, so be it,"" rather than, ""Alas, poor me, an old man, it is for this that I have kept my grey hairs!""

\- The Discourses of Epictetus I.4

I believe this confusion is primarily caused by being introduced to the Meditations as their first Stoic reading material, which brings me to my next point.

**How it applies to the original texts**

As I mentioned just now, I’d bet my money on the Meditations being the primary cause of this confusion. That’s because the Meditations is mostly *descriptive,* there are very few passages in there I can think of that are actually *prescriptive.*

We need to remember, that Marcus had had decades of Stoic training when he wrote it - he was already one of the most well-versed Stoics in human history; and the Meditations was not written to teach others to be like him – it was his private journal. A master guitarist doesn’t need to write down in his journal where to place his fingers on the guitar, he will probably write something like “a 1-minute solo would fit nicely in this segment of this song”.

The Discourses of Epictetus is by far the most *prescriptive* book out of all the remaining original Stoic texts we have. Epictetus is also quite explicit whenever he states his instructions if you read it carefully. Even Marcus himself implied the importance of this book in his Stoic education on the very first page of the Meditations:

>7. From Rusticus: to get an impression of need for reform and treatment of character; not to run off into zeal for rhetoric, writing on speculative themes, discoursing on edifying texts, exhibiting in fanciful colours the ascetic or the philanthropist. To avoid oratory, poetry, and preciosity; not to parade at home in ceremonial costume or to do things of that kind; to write letters in the simple style, like his own from Sinuessa to my mother. To be easily recalled to myself and easily reconciled with those who provoke and offend, as soon as they are willing to meet me. To read books accurately and not be satisfied with superficial thinking about things or agree hurriedly with those who talk round a subject. **To have made the acquaintance of the** ***Discourses*** **of Epictetus, of which he allowed me to share a copy of his own.**

\- The Meditations, book I

There is another anecdotal evidence of this book being a primary education material to the ancient Stoics:

>With these words then the Stoic rid himself of the rich Asiatic. But later, when we were approaching Brundisium and sea and sky were calm, I asked him what the reason for his fear was, which he had refused to reveal to the man who had improperly addressed him. And he quietly and courteously replied: “Since you are desirous of knowing, hear what our forefathers, the founders of the Stoic sect, thought about that brief but inevitable and natural fear, or rather,” said he, “read it, for if you read it, you will be the more ready to believe it and you will remember it better.” **Thereupon before my eyes he drew from his little bag the fifth book of the** ***Discourses*** **of the philosopher Epictetus, which, as arranged by Arrian, undoubtedly agree with the writings of Zeno and Chrysippus.**

\- Aulus Gellius’ The Attic Nights

It should be abundantly clear at this point that the Discourses of Epictetus was amongst the most important Stoic learning materials at the time, and the people back then also had access to the works  of other prominent Stoic figures such as Zeno and Chrysippus. We are fortunate enough to still have access to this book in modern times (albeit half of it is lost), there is simply no reason we shouldn’t follow what the ancients did by using it as our main educational text.

Seneca’s letters and essays are also a decent source of instructional texts. The problem is his love of verbal barrage (he was a famous playwright at the time) means his writings are often very long-winded and in my opinion excessively sophisticated for the purpose of education.

I find his writings more poetic than they are educational, and I often find myself lost in a sort of “trance” when reading his texts, especially his essays. I still struggle to keep track of Seneca’s points when reading his essays to this day.

To me reading Seneca is something I do more for “reading pleasure” for a lack of better words than for learning. Of course that’s just me, if you have a different experience with reading Seneca then by all means do it as part of your learning.

**How we apply it in our Stoic practice**

A marathon runner and a sprinter both share the same goal of being the best at their sport, and thus to train their body to be at its physical peak in the most suitable way for their sport. But the marathon runner is primarily concerned with endurance whereas the sprinter speed. As such their training regimes have to be different.

It is also the case for our Stoic practice. Each of us has a different purpose, a different role to play in the cosmopolis; each of us has a different upbringing, different strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, how we train ourselves in the way of the Stoics must by necessity be different. Again I will quote Epictetus on this same point here:

>I am inclined to pleasure; I will betake myself to the opposite side of the rolling ship, and that beyond measure, so as to train myself. I am inclined to avoid hard work; I will strain and exercise my sense-impressions to this end, so that my aversion from everything of this kind shall cease. For who is the man in training? He is the man who practises not employing his desire, and practises employing his aversion only upon the things that are within the sphere of his moral purpose, yes, and practises particularly in the things that are difficult to master. **And so different men will have to practise particularly to meet different things**.

\- The Discourses of Epictetus III.12

**Conclusion**

In summary, if you wish to make progress in your Stoic training, it is important that you set yourself a description as a goal and devise a prescriptive plan to train yourself towards attaining that goal.

Don’t just start with a far-fetched goal like “I want to be like Marcus Aurelius!”. That’s like watching [a video of Van Halen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULEBSxP725w) and immediately saying “I want to play the guitar like him”, or reading about theoretical Physics for the first time and saying ""I want to win a Nobel prize in Physics!""

Start with something small and managable, something like “I want to stop being a slave to material wealth” if this is one of your weaknesses, then proceed to train yourself to get accustomed to a life with minimal material possessions.

It is also crucial that you are completely honest with yourself about your shortcomings, and be fully committed to follow the plan you devise, in the same vein you have to be completely honest with your doctor about your symptoms and follow her treatment plan if you want to recover most effectively from your illness.

P.S. If this post reads like another “Drop the freaking Meditations and pick up the bloody Discourses of Epictetus”, that’s because it probably is.",Stoicism,1702104495.0,t3_18e7n8l,0.94,28

Now it’s basically, “I just broke up with my gf” or “how do I handle getting rejected by my crush?”

Is stoicism the next philosophy of losing your humanity?,"I saw the comments and responses on that poor person's page. Yall were out here saying how it's different from any war and did we feel the same for Ukraine and what about Isreal. Like excuse me?

We're seeing children with blown off faces and getting their limbs amputated and disembodied. Did you see that shit during the Ukraine War that's an actual war and not a holocaust? No? And why would you feel bad for the offending party who aren't suffering at all? Isreal has been doing and saying the most atrocious things. You people disgust me.

Life is suffering,"It is my understanding that the Stoics, similar to the Buddhists, advocate accepting that there is a certain amount of suffering in life.  I believe the Buddhists even say that life **IS** suffering.  Instead of waiting and being put off kilter by life's obstacles, the Stoics advocate premeditatio malorum, a kind of meditation on the negativity that might come your way in a given day.

&#x200B;

I don't use that morning meditation every day.  I tend to remember it when things in my life are trending downward; that's when I'm usually grasping at whatever tools I have to make my life better.  I do find it useful.

&#x200B;

More importantly, for me, is the mere acceptance or acknowledgment that my life circumstances are exactly as they must be, warts and all.  I have some influence, but I cannot control them.   Life cannot be without suffering, so I need to accept it as it is. 

&#x200B;

Similarly too, both the Stoics and Buddhist believe that reality itself is neutral, in terms of its significance, but that it's our judgments about the reality that can cause us to suffer.  I am continually having to remind myself of this truth when I go down the rabbit hole of negativity.

&#x200B;

Being more accepting of life's struggles means less suffering  because I'm not constantly craving what isn't.

&#x200B;

I'm a novice student of Stoicism and Buddhism, so I would appreciate any comments that clarify or even correct what I'm trying to say.

From my perspective, i am interested specifically in the first part talking about merit and he seems to me, to be talking about merit in regards to achievement or the desire for achievement. 

Epictetus lists all the sources NOT for personal merit.

Is there any advice from Epictetus or any other stoic greats regarding acceptable sources of obtaining ""personal merit""?

I am affected by what is currently happening in Gaza.,"I feel like nothing makes any sense anymore.

Just because I specifically mentioned Gaza doesn't mean I am not compassionate toward other races and countries too. What is wrong with some of you? I pity both the innocent people of Israel and Palestine. I am also saddened by what has happened in both Ukraine and Russia. I HAVE EMPATHY FOR ALL HUMAN KINDS AND RACES.

I am not siding with any side; I am against the people who are in charge behind all of this cruelty and those who support these actions.

Just because something worse happened in other countries doesn't mean we shouldn't stand up for other countries too. I don't know wtf happened to compassion. Why can't we all just be fvcking kind.

Being in your late teens and early 20s,"So, we get a very steady stream of posts here along the lines of “I’m 18-25 and I don’t know what to do with my life, don’t understand why I haven’t achieved anything yet, don’t understand why the world seems so bleak and pointless, etc”.

The reason is that you’re 18-25. That period of life is exactly when you question everything, as you come out of childhood and start to work out how to be an adult. This is, in short, a very normal way to feel and a very normal process to go through. 

Don’t be afraid. Let the questions present themselves and allow yourself time to find the answers. Very very VERY few people have things figured out at this stage. Be patient and calm, and allow yourself to be young and still learning. It’s ok not to know what you’re doing yet.

A Brief Gratitude for Stoicism,"I am from a developing country. If people from the developed world can be... well, untrustworthy, politically polarized, immature, horrible and so on, think developed world - economy and institutions and live with that for the rest of your life. I write this on every post in general so I think this has become essentially a part of my internet identity (and not my oh-so-glamorous IRL identity, unless I see discrimination here) 

So when I'm very grateful for Stoicism and the dichotomy of control. I've read and re-read original stoic texts countless times, with pencils and highlighting and all that good stuff. I would not claim I am an expert but if I've almost a decade of experience with 7 Habits of Effective People, I think I already have had a good introduction to Stoicism. Even the ""later"" stoics (big 3) abandoned stoic physics & stoic logic and just concerned themselves with stoic ethics (Discipline of Action) for the most part.

Stoicism as a school did not survive. But oh my god if we did not have the basic ability to focus on what is up to us (or ""control"") and did not have the ancient authors basically contributing to modern psychotherapy and science... I personally don't know how I'd deal with all the pressure and all my personal demons.

So thanks. I'm practically a first generation lawyer and hopefully will work as a District & Sessions judge before retirement. I think I'll never be called ""Justice <name>"" but that's perfectly fine. So, yeah, thank god for the good people behind stoicism and this sub. Even in this sub itself, things get pretty non-stoic and meta... but I think that's to be expected considering we're all humans and imperfect, like Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius and Cicero. 

So thank god for all the Stoic podcasts, authors, translators, and simply fellow students of this philosophy for sharing very good information with me. The first and foremost principle in Stoicism is the principle of Justice (a virtue) and personally I'd have gone crazy with my unorthodox lifestyle and unconventional life story if it weren't for Stoicism and related philosophies.

""Vices assail and surround us on all sides, and they don’t allow  us to rise again and lift our eyes to the clear discernment of truth;  but they press down on them, keeping them lowered and ﬁ xed on  mere desire. It’s never possible for their victims to return to their  true selves. If by chance they ever ﬁ nd some respite, they still roll  restlessly, just like the deep sea, which still swells even after the wind  has settled; they never ﬁ nd full relaxation from their desires""



Q.1The way he said""It’s never possible for their victims to return to their  true selves""
I felt like it isn't possible even after they quoted the vices




""Look  back and recall when you were ever sure of your purpose; how few  days turned out as you’d intended; when you were ever at your own  disposal; when your face showed its own expression; when your mind  was free from disturbance; what accomplishment you can claim in  such a long life; how many have plundered your existence without  your being aware of what you were losing; how much time has been  lost to groundless anguish, foolish pleasure, greedy desire, the charms  of society; how little is left to you from your own store of time. You’ll  come to realize that you’re dying before your time.”



Q.2 The part ""how few  days turned out as you’d intended""

They are just impermanent opinions holding no inherent value or weight.  That I somehow had the power to choose a different interpretation of the so-called facts was a revelation.

Prior to that, and other readings I was doing, I was so unconscious that I was often-times ensnared by my thinking, believing it was my reality (even when objective facts contradicted my thoughts); instead of being aware of the thinker, with the power to change my thoughts, or to not think at all, i.e., meditate or be mindful.

Now I wish I could say that I no longer get ensnared by my thoughts, which in turn can get me down, but at least now I'm more quickly able to intercede and question the runaway thoughts.  Thank goodness for the philosophers to help us lead a more meaningful life.",Stoicism,1701898132.0,t3_18cernq,0.95,36
Reference for a quote,"I have stumbled upon this wonderful quote of Marcus Aurelius:  


""*Don’t return to philosophy as a task-master, but as patients seek out relief in a treatment of sore eyes, or a dressing for a burn, or from an ointment. Regarding it this way, you’ll obey reason without putting it on display and rest easy in its care.*"" Book 5:9

Should I forgive no matter what?,"Hello everyone, i’m relatively new to stoicism although I have been looking into stoic views for some time now. I am having trouble trying to decide the best course of action for my own mental and for my sports team regarding forgiveness of a teamate. A player on this sports team that I will call Jake brings down the entire team. Not just in a bad attitude towards the game way but in an instigator with his own teammates way. Jake and I were previously pretty close friends even spending some time together outside of our sport. Until Jake started being such a douche that I called him out for it. If you can’t tell yet, Jake isn’t the type of guy to appreciate being called out in front of his peers. We butted heads for many months but never let it affect us on the field. Recently it had gotten much worse as jake said cruel things to my face, gotten physical with me and my belongings/equipment, and tried to convince teamates I didn’t belong on the team. Now I am a pretty level headed guy, I didn’t let this affect me as I felt sorry for him because he is obviously lacking in some department to have to go after someone like this. What I refused to let happen was my image with others be tampered and for Jake to affect the chemistry of the team where it affects us in game play. During this period I looked at stoicism for guidance and I think I did the right thing. Not once did I raise my voice at Jake, lay my hands on jake, or even talk badly about jake to others. I reasoned that Jake is feeling a certain way and needs to take it out on others. 

Now I will skip some time and get to the part where i need advice. Jake came up to me personally and grabbed my hand shaking it and said “i’m sorry for being such a bad teammate, im working on it” I didn’t say “It’s okay” as being a bad teammate is not okay but i thanked him for his apology. My question is, in stoic principle should I be accepting Jake back into my life as a friend?",Stoicism,1701924045.0,t3_18cnmvp,0.73,5
My criticism of Stoicism,"My criticism has to do with the emphasis that the ancient stoic sages gave to various virtues. Early stoicism was greatly influenced by Socratic piety and its virtue ethics of justice, temperance, courage, and wisdom. Aristotelian ethics also greatly influenced the stoics. Aristotle proposed the following nine virtues: wisdom, prudence, justice, fortitude, courage, liberality, magnificence, magnanimity, and temperance. 

Absent in these virtues and the stoic writings is the virtue of agape. This is a selfless, unconditional love that transcends romantic or familial love. This love is central to Christian theology. The core texts on this love are the sermon on the mount, attributed to Jesus, and the writing of the apostle Paul. 

A parallel to agape or “Christian love” can be found in eastern wisdom traditions as well. In Buddhism, especially the Theravada tradition, they emphasize Metta or the cultivation of boundless, unconditional love and goodwill toward all living beings.

Now the stoics did emphasize benevolence and kindness towards others, but the conception of agape is never a central part of the stoic ethic. I consider myself a novice practicing stoic, and have found that as I continue to learn and grow, my practice of virtue has been improved as I have worked to prioritize the development of agape.",Stoicism,1701914706.0,t3_18ckotn,0.69,6

Is resilience necessary?,"In a conversation here today, the idea of resilience was discussed and it was put to me that resilience is an important thing in Stoicism. I agreed at the time, but on reflection I wonder whether I was wrong. 

The word resilient has always suggested something springy to me, a surface which can be struck and bounce back, like a sapling or a good mattress. In humans, resilience is the ability to weather difficulty and recover from adversity. 

However, the Sage does not experience anything she considers adversity. Winds blow but they do not push her back. Correctly judging all circumstances, she has no need to be resilient because she experiences no suffering. 

Of course none of us are a Sage, but I wonder if resilience is the wrong thing for a student of Stoicism to strive towards. If we are affected enough to need resilience, presumably there is a flaw in our reasoning which needs to be addressed.

the ground; I have no wife, no children; no praetorium, but only the
earth and heavens, and one poor cloak. And what do I want? Am I not
without sorrow? am I not without fear? Am I not free? When did any

Choose not to be harmed—and you won’t feel harmed. Don’t feel harmed—and you haven’t been.,"I like this quote. I come back to it often. I wanted to know if I am applying it correctly after certain situations. 

For example. Every so often I will get into a negative confrontation which leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I tend to obsessive about things in gerneral. Be overly sensitive. Deem everything as a slight at times. I don't want to drone on but someone posted a post something like stoicism is not therapy or substitute for it. And it's not. Not for someone with add who hates to read it definitely won't be. But certain quotes like the one above really can make an impact. Now!! The point. 

Basically I went to a store I do deliveries for they know me. I asked the employee for an additional plastic bag to keep something warm. And he would just not want to do it. Said we can't? I challenged him. He didn't relent. I said I will pay for a freaking 2 cent bag. Still would not do it. Very infuriating, frustrating. Annoying.

Stoicism helps with depression,"
I will never make the claim that Stoicism is a tried and true ""cure"" to depression and/or suicidal ideation. However, I know that the lessons I personally have learned through philosophy as a whole, and Stoicism in particular, have helped me grow a lot in the last few months.

I have my low days still but I have learned how to face those thoughts and feelings from a far more practical view by changing my judgement. Every day I make the choice to allow those thoughts to run rampant or challenge them by seeing them ""for what they are"" as Marcus Aurelius put it. It's not necessarily that Stoicism cured me, it just gave me the tools to confront something I believed was bigger than myself for a long time. 

No amount of psych drugs or therapy can magically ""cure"" a person if they don't change their negative thought patterns and mindset. People who need help **should** seek it, and Stoicism has helped me and many others improve how they handle things.",Stoicism,1701871923.0,t3_18c4t0k,0.92,10

Stoicism is not a replacement for therapy.,"As the title says.

Stoicism is not a replacement for medical intervention. It can replace mental healthy therapy as much as it can replace physical therapy.

It can be an brilliant *companion* to medical intervention as you navigate recovery from any given problem, but it is not a replacement.

Remember, a stoic seeks to understand the world around us. To prioritise knowledge and wisdom above all else. 

There is a wealth of quality, validated research on mental health treatments.

The moment we reject the best established science in favour of *our own interpretation of a philosophy* is the moment we stop being rational, and start treating stoicism as a faith.

This is not just for the very large amount of people coming here seeking stoicism as a replacement for therapy, but directed at the far too many people encouraging using stoicism as a replacement for therapy.

The stoics once believed gravity was that objects are compelled to return to their natural resting point as an innate property of the object itself - A rock belongs on the floor so it is compelled to return there! A good stoic does not go ""No, Newton is wrong... it's not mass attracts mass"", so don't do it for medical science.",Stoicism,1701776416.0,t3_18ba5bk,0.95,519
Stoicism and art?,"Just finished Meditiations for the first time, and I could only find one brief passage about the relationship between Marcus and art. In one passage, can’t remember which one, MA mentioned music, and how if one were to break down a piece into each one of its notes, they could not affect him on their own. From this combined with Marcus telling himself to stop reading books, I infer that he does not believe that art is “good.” While Marcus did ‘cite’ several plays and literary works, this was the only passage I could find in direct relation to it so if someone can find more I would appreciate it.
Here is my core dilemma: I understand that one of the base precepts of stoicism is to not indulge in pleasures. To only seek clarity of the mind and to do the right thing for humanity, as your nature demands of you.

How (24m) to get over oneitis/crush (22f) that’s completely out of my league?,"So, I’ve \[24M\] had this intense crush on this woman \[22F\] for about 3 years now.

She’s so beautiful and pretty and I’ve been infatuated with her ever since I saw her. The problem is, is that she’s completely out of my league. She’s a well-known dancer in our community and has thousands of followers on her Instagram and TikTok. She’s super popular with many friends and a great social life, comes from a nice supportive family and rich background.

Meanwhile, there’s me, a 24-year-old loser virgin that’s still in university and living with his parents. I only have 3 friends and a lackluster social life. I have no relationship experience whatsoever due to my struggles with my mental health and abusive home situation that has held me back tremendously. I’m poor and broke and I have a lot of acne scars on my face that makes me really ugly. Not to mention I’m short as well.

Seneca - is there 20 books comprising letters to lucilius,"Hi 

So I'm reading letters of seneca and I have been fascinated by the legend and I thought of reading further more about him, 
I asked chat gpt how many books are there from seneca

And this was the output ! So is there actually each letters from penguin Classics are written in a bigger format as in 20 books? Or am I missing any information? 

Certainly! Seneca's ""Letters to Lucilius"" (Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium) are commonly organized into 20 books. Each ""book"" contains a set of letters, and in total, there are 124 letters. 

Here's a simplified breakdown of the organization:

Books 1-9: These books contain the majority of the letters, with each book consisting of a varying number of letters addressing different philosophical topics and life advice.Books 10-12: These books include letters on various subjects, continuing the themes of earlier books.

Books 13-16: These books are sometimes considered separately as ""On Groundless Fears,"" as they primarily focus on dealing with fears and anxieties.

Books 17-20: These books contain the final set of letters, exploring various Stoic principles and life lessons.",Stoicism,1701881816.0,t3_18c8e29,0.67,1

Stoicism can be a replacement for therapy,"Around my house I can fix things like leaky faucets and dead vacuums, but if a problem brings me close to electrical main lines I call an electrician. I'm happy to do it, but I'd never call him over to change a light bulb---it's faster, cheaper, better for me to do it myself.

A small problem faced by a woman steeped in a good philosophy is nothing for her to handle on her own.

I had my first “sexual” experience at 5, with my two other male cousins. It was the turning point in my life. From then on it has been nothing but a downhill slope from there. I like to be around children and keep them happy and to make sure that nothing harms them. That they can stay their innocent and happy selves, wish someone would’ve had done that with me. Turns out from the three of us, I was the only one to develop feelings for guys even though it was never my idea nor did I like it. I’ve always felt dirty ever since then.

The issues I had trying to apply stoic principles,"This year I started my stoic journey and I've been enjoying it so far. I feel better overall, but the thing I like the most about stoicism is that I have guidance or some sort of ""framework"" on how to behave on any given situation, which facilitates making tough decisions.

One issue I struggled with for some time is knowing what would be ""the stoic way"" to handle certain scenarios I faced in my life. And this was an issue for two reasons:

1. I would have to search for a specific teaching/quote/insight on stoic books that would relate to the situation I'm going through. This is not easy since most stoic books (at least the most popular ones) aren't structured in an organized way. They're mostly just a bunch of teachings with no particular order or association to a specific subject.
2. Once I found some quote or teaching, it was hard to clearly understand the underlying message. I'm kind of new to philosophy, so most times the language used was difficult for me to understand.

So I ended up building an app that would help me with that. I'm not intending to do self-promotion so I wont share any particular details, but I imagine if its helping me now, it can potentially help others.

So I would like to know what people practicing Stoicism think about the concept and what I could do to make it useful to others, so I can share it through the appropriate channels.

It works as follow:

1. You enter some situation you're going through your life. Could be anything, from minor things that happen on your day-to-day to more meaningful situations that affect your overall wellbeing.
2. The app scan through a set of stoic books looking for quotes or teachings that relate to your scenario.
3. Using AI, the app display's the following:

   2. The quote explained in plain english. No complex or ancient language, the quote is explained as a friend would explain it to you.

# Example

**My scenario:**

*I'm working on expanding my social circle and building meaningful friendships. It's not easy for me to connect with new people and maintain those relationships since I'm very shy*

**The quote taken from books:**

*Judge no speech or action unworthy of you which is consistent with nature. Be not dissuaded by any consequent criticism or censure from others; but, if the speech or action be honourable, judge yourself worthy to say or do it. Those who criticize you have their own conscience and their own motives. These you are not to regard, but follow a straight course, guided by your own nature and the nature of the Universe, both of which point the same way.*

**The quote explained:**

Do not let the opinions or criticisms of others discourage you from pursuing actions that are in line with your own nature and the nature of the Universe. If your intentions are honorable, consider yourself worthy of engaging in those actions or expressing those thoughts. The judgments and motives of others should not influence your decisions, as they have their own perspectives and motivations. Instead, stay true to yourself and follow the path that aligns with your nature and the greater order of the Universe.

**The quote in the context of my scenario:**

In your scenario of expanding your social circle and building meaningful friendships, it is important to remember that you should not let the shyness or potential criticism from others deter you from connecting with new people. The quote emphasizes that you should not judge your own actions or words as unworthy simply because they may be met with criticism or disapproval. Instead, if your intentions are genuine and honorable, you should consider yourself worthy of making the effort to connect with others and build meaningful relationships. The opinions and judgments of others should not hinder your pursuit of social connections, as they have their own perspectives and motivations. Stay true to your own nature and the natural inclination for human connection, and do not let external factors discourage you from taking action.

"Genuinely curious, why should I live if no one can love me","I don’t have a single friend. They all abandoned me for various reasons or they betrayed me. I always was treated like an option or just a background character. Never treated like a *friend*. I’ve never had a boyfriend or a girlfriend before because I am physically unattractive. I’m 24 and female. My relationship with my immediate family has been diminishing since I’ve been completely alone for years. 

I’ve never felt proper love. I’ve been alone, ignored, treated like shit by nearly everyone around me, stranger or not. I can’t make friends, but either way, I don’t really want to because I can’t trust or tolerate anyone anymore after being alone for so long. No one understands that my life is over, there is no hope or “right people” for me. It’s either gas myself (I already have a suicide plan) or live the rest of my life alone, depressed and struggling. No one wants to be around me, no matter what I do no one wants to be my friend and no one wants to be with me because I’m ugly. And no, this is not going to change. Despite what people say, no it doesn’t get better or change. It doesn’t matter what I’ve done, I’ve never won socially. 

I’ve met so many people and befriended them. Only for a temporary time. And I’m still completely alone. My personality is bitter and angry, nothing can change that. My life is truly over and no. Like I said. It’s not going to change. I’ve been like this since I left high school. 

Why should I live? I don’t know anyone else, online or irl in the same situation. Sure, they may not have ever had a parter, but they have friends. Or vice versa. But no one has neither except me. I’m clearly a defect of a human, incapable of being loved or even tolerated by the same species. Im tired of the same BS advice, that it will change and get better.

Core precepts/values and virtues - clarification please,"Bear with me here as I may be using the terms incorrectly.

Epictetus advised us to have core precepts to guide us in our daily lives.

Let's say we choose things such as: Being mindful and intentional. Staying in our power (not letting others sway us); being disciplined etc

Is the assumption correct that the virtues Temperance, Wisdom, Courage, Justice aren't core values as such but are what underpin our core values? Therefore the virtues are the foundations that help us with our core values?

Stoicism Vs. Unconditional Forgiveness,"There’s a man named Cliffe Knechtle, a pastor. I came across a video of his which speaks on “forgiveness” and if it has limits. I wanted to make an attempt to respond to how I *think* a practicing stoic would. I would love the insight of others, and the assistance with realigning wherever I may fall short. 

Interviewer: “When does God say “No more, I can’t forgive you for this.”?

Cliff: “I used to work in a prison at Lawrence Massachusetts. Every monday night I would go there, and I first would go into the cell of a man in protective custody who kidnapped little boys, sexually abused him, and murdered him. And after being with him I would go into the basketball gym to play basketball with the other inmates and they would come up to me and say, “Cliffe how can you even talk to such a piece of dirt, don’t you know what he did?” And I say, “Yes I do know what he did, pretty horrendous, pretty grotesque, pretty evil, but he still is a human being created in the image of God, and god offers him forgiveness as horrible as that is. Now there’s a part of me that doesn’t like that, cause I’ve never kidnapped little boys, sexually molested him and murdered him, so I think I’m better. No unfortunately I’m not better, Because in my own sophisticated erudite way I have rebelled against God. I am in desperate need of God’s Grace, his forgiveness, and for me to look down on a guy like that and and say, “Oh, you’re just so inferior, you’re just a piece of dirt” No, he’s a human being created in the image of God, that image has been horribly defaced, horribly, but he still is a human being created in the image of God and God offers him forgiveness.”

- The man in question kidnapped, molested and murdered little boys. This in itself is considered an indifference/external. So, it’s how we use what has happened that is ‘good’ or ‘bad’. ‘Good’ would be to lock this person up or prevent them from doing what they’ve done again in any way possible. ‘Bad’ would be to *not* prevent this person from doing what they’ve done again, in whatever way possible. 

- If we were in a position to choose whether to speak to the criminal, or to…*not* speak to them, the choice is dependent on whether or not doing so would be an act of virtue, with virtue being assigned to what is dependent on our will. If this is the case, then the decision on whether we speak to him or not makes no difference, but how we act within each choice *does* make the difference. If we decided to speak to him, what would be the virtuous way to do so? 

“*You say, “Philosophers talk paradoxes” But are there no paradoxes in the other arts? and what is more paradoxical than to puncture a man’s eye in order that he may see? If anyone said this to a man ignorant of the surgical art, would he not ridicule the speaker? Where is the wonder then if in philosophy also many things which are true appear paradoxical to the inexperienced?*” Epictetus, Discourse 1.25 “On the Same”. 

Based on this quote, I’ve concluded that if I listened to my impression then yes, I would choose not to speak to him because doing so would be bad. However, if my purpose in speaking with the criminal was to learn about why he did it and to prevent it from occurring again, then it would be the right way to act. If I chose to speak to him only to remind him of how shitty of a person is and throw insults at him, this would be *bad* because I am harming my own character by doing this. —— The inexperienced in this case would be the prisoners that question why Cliff even speaks to the man. (?)

-  “*Now there’s a part of me that doesn’t like that, cause I’ve never kidnapped little boys, sexually molested him and murdered him, so I think i’m better. No unfortunately I’m not better, because in my own sophisticated erudite way I have rebelled against God*”. It seems that within Christianity, Rebelling against God = acting without virtue. At least, if our decision to think “I’m better than this guy” leads us to act without virtue, then it is bad. So, am I better than this child, Lester? The truth is: It doesn’t matter. 

- Finally, forgiveness. Would I/Should I forgive? Well, it’s not even my place to forgive. This would be desiring what belongs to others which is a no no. If it WERE my place to forgive (ex. I’m the child that was murdered), whether I forgive or not is…no?

Suppressing emotions,"Hey there,
Am 17 and I am relatively new to stoicism I had lot of trouble while traveling the journey of life,
The problem is that I feel like,I am emotionally weak at times I can't control my anger.whenever I feel angry.I try to control myself but there are times when I have meltdowns whenever I supress my angry for way too long(happens rarely tho).there was this kid from  my class whose bigger than me usually makes fun of me(dudes a bully) most of the time around my classmates,one day we got into an argument and I never were good at arguments,
So I started throwing hands with him and I somehow managed to knock the dude out with a single scratch but even tho I felt sense of happiness after that,later on post realisation hit me like a truck after realising the collatral damage I have created(I accidentally hurt my friends who were trying to seperate us).even tho he was the one who started all of this mess,i apologised to everyone present there.whenever I let my anger control myself I have no memories of the event also I could have accidentally severly injured the guy if I choked him any longer

So I don't want anger to control myself there were many instances similar to this.i always try my best not to cause any trouble and I try my best to avoid being angry at people.but unfortunately I get into fights way often considering how emotionally unstable I am and my mom asked what would happen if I accidentally kill someone if I let my anger control me(as there were similar events just like this)and the question still revolves in my head.

There are also instances were i cry infront of people which I feel is embarassing.how can I come to peace with myself and I know for a fact violence is never a solution",Stoicism,1701699391.0,t3_18al487,0.71,3
How can one be virtuous if they have a bad moral compass,"Hi all, 

I have been practicing Stoicism for a couple years now but have a question regarding the philosophy which I can’t figure out (probably due to my inexperience/knowledge) The philosophy is more broadly a practical one rather than theoretical one, and encourages people to learn through experience rather than pure study, ‘waste no time arguing what a good man should be. Be one’ 

How does this work if you have an objectively bad moral compass but don’t realise it, I.e. think you are doing the right thing, but are actually causing more harm to people than good, but in your eyes you are practicing stoicism. 

Doesn’t this idea mean we should actually debate what is right and wrong to broaden our understanding of virtue?",Stoicism,1701682535.0,t3_18agpnx,0.8,9

How to overcome severe emotional and physical suffering alongside chronic pain,"I (19M) have been through multiple rough patches in my life. To summarize, I struggled with bullying and loneliness as a child. My home country is going through a civil war, and my father has lost all his life savings and our family's wealth and committed suicide after I tried to stop him (but clearly didn't do enough). So, at the mere age of 16, my family fell apart, and we became semi-broke. Add that to the grief of my losing my father and the trauma from the event. This was during COVID-19, so the physical isolation did not really help.

But, throughout all of this, I still managed to succeed in school and gained admission to a top university in the US with a full scholarship. Being the oldest son, I was always the one expected to perform, and I always had a goal of giving back to my mother. During my time at university, I also managed to get a great GPA and pursued multiple internships throughout my summers and during the semesters. I had a carefully crafted plan to reach my goals, and I was determined to succeed despite everything.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Fast forward to the beginning of my most important semester yet, the one where I have to apply for my junior internships and the one where I have to take the hardest yet most important courseload. I started developing pain in my testicles; being the diligent person I am, I saw a specialist the next day of that happening. I got prescribed antibiotics, yet after completing a course of 3 weeks, the pain never went away. But I was determined not to let this pain stop me from pursuing my goals. A month later, after being in constant pain and going to 3 different doctors, I started having pain in my right testicle; this pain was excruciating. I immediately went to the ER, where they conducted imaging and lab tests and concluded nothing was wrong, so I was sent on my way. But the pain never really subsided. After countless ER and specialist visits, I was found to have a blood clot in my right-sided scrotum, which is apparently so rare only 25 cases have been previously documented. I took my meds, but the constant pain never really went away. It seems the condition is ""resolved,"" i.e., they can't find the clots anymore. But here I am left with a constant pain that often turns excruciating over the course of 4 months with no doctor seeming to help and hope of relief in the future.

&#x200B;

I couldn't apply for internships, and my academics suffered greatly to the point where I started failing classes; I am now experiencing severe depression and chronic pain. My body is always tired and fatigued. I can't help but think of my friends and colleagues who are all leading everyday nice lives, and some of whom are succeeding in the way I dreamt and worked so hard to achieve.

I now live alone and practically isolated, away from family, severely depressed, bedridden, and in chronic pain. My life fell apart, and I have lost my dreams and goals.

How would a stoic approach this predicament? How can I train my mindset to continue pushing through these problems?

Is it possible to kill one's ego?,"The practice of stoicism teaches us to control our inner reactions to the things from the outside world that we have no control over, but most of the time, our ego stands in the way. You might (speaking from my own experience) envy someone else's success (even if that someone is close to you), try to elevate yourself higher in other people's eyes by showing off or by humiliating someone else, etc. and all of those come from our ego.

No freedom in life.," 

I dont want to bore y'all with details, so in short, I am 19F. My mother doesn't give me much freedom to go outside home alone unless its college/work. This lack of autonomy has resulted in a pretty boring life, and zero life outside academics. It gets quite mundane, but my thoughts entertain me. However, a time frequently comes where I have reject my friends' invitations to outings/meetups/malls/college programs, etc and that's when I realize that I have no liberty in my life, causing emotional pain and pity like no other. Its been years now, I believe I should be used to it.

There's isn't much I can do about it either, I have tried reasoning things out multiple time and it doesn't end well. I can only move out at 24-25 (Our culture doesn't allow moving out either but I have a plan figured out). Logically it is easy to convince myself that I can't do much about it but it doesn't ease the emotional pain, specially when I have relive this while explaining to situations to friends, or think of the memories I could have made.

The only thing I end up doing is distracting myself from pain by social media or video games. I see no other way out.

Accept or Adverse,"Too often do I hear and read from so called professionals, gurus, mentors, authors, priests, etc 
That Stoicism is too passive of a practice and relies to heavy on determinism and apathy therefore having no effect on the conscience mind that is constantly trying to progress. For reference, Iv read E, S, and MA more times than I can count and continue to read them daily alongside my Bible. This is my path as a Prokopton.  What really grinds my gears is for the high level articles and pundits to give the observation that we are to accept all that happens to us. Blasphemy! I see it here in this Reddit group more than I can count and I hope this post will serve as my response in future discourses. 


“The true man is revealed in difficult times. So when trouble comes, think of yourself as a wrestler whom God, like a trainer, has paired with a tough young buck. For what purpose? To turn you into Olympic-class material.” Epictetus

“What would have become of Hercules, do you think, if there had been no lion, hydra, stag or boar – and no savage criminals to rid the world of? What would he have done in the absence of such challenges? Obviously he would have just rolled over in bed and gone back to sleep. So by snoring his life away in luxury and comfort he never would have developed into the mighty Hercules.” Epictetus

What I’m saying is, giving the response of “it’s not in my control” isn’t an all encompassing response to difficulty. The message that so many miss. Mainly the dichotomy of control isn’t just about recognizing what is external or internal so you can disregard uncontrollable events, it’s about recognizing what you can/need to take action on. 

So many more teachings and examples exist here but I don’t want the message to be lost due to length. Let’s discuss, please comment or message me.",Stoicism,1701636592.0,t3_18a2xz2,0.88,6
Been experiencing anger issues lately.,"I moved here in Romania recently and today has marked 2 months since my arrival, I started a ""new life"" as some may say, with a better job and out of the ghetto, I came here to take care of my grandma because she raised me and I want to honor my grandfather who died this year, a true orthodox family man. 

But I made a lot of sacrifices to come here, I was used to having dozens of friends, now I have like two, my girlfriend of one year and a half broke up with me because I decided to go and take care of my family and a long distance was ""too much"" for her despite me being willing to make a 1100km trip just to see her every month. 

And apparently this, plus the job I work which is indeed pretty easy but is a hard to master skill, have made me notice I've been becoming way angrier than I was. 

I have my father's explosive anger and my mother's vengefulness, which may indeed be assets at times but the explosive part is making me want to punch the shit out of anything that doesn't work within 2 seconds. 

I already go to the gym..i think i will start boxing since im interested in it and punching is literally my immediate reflex to anything nowadays for some reason. 

But I'd want also a more in depth opinion of the Stoics of how I could handle this. 

I've also been told at work that I look very angry, and obviously i do when i don't hit the targets needed immediately even tho I've been told I'm very good for my first month I am still quite competitive.

"Logos, the mind, and change","**TLDR**:

If you're dissatisfied with your circumstances and you want to change your dissatisfaction, you have to change either your reasoning process to change your judgements about your circumstances, the circumstances themselves, or a combination of both. The rest of the title is only ~~for the nerds~~ a click-bait.

**Full post**:

I’ve noticed a common pattern in advice posts where the posters ask how to be content about a situation in life they’re obviously dissatisfied with, yet they insist on changing neither their desire nor their situation. Typically they mention doing Stoic “practices” such as “acceptance of fate”, “negative visualisation”, “dichotomy of control”, etc.

In this post I will try to explain why none of these “practices” by themselves have any causal effects on contentment by relating to the concept of Logos and the Stoic theory of the mind.

***Logos***

Logos is defined as “the rational principle governing the universe” ([source](https://iep.utm.edu/stoicism/#SH2b)). The word “rational” here means explainable, consistent, causal, and deterministic. In other words the opposite of true random chance. Note that the ancients didn’t come up with the abstract concept “rational” and looked for things existing in the universe that they could apply this concept on. It’s the other way around – they observed that things existing in the universe follow a causal pattern and they described the phenomenon as “rational”.

This “rational” characteristic of the universe is what allows us to thrive using our “rational” mind. We are the only animal species that’s capable of comprehending this “rationality” permeating throughout the universe and using it to our advantage.

It might be difficult to wrap your head around this concept because it’s the only observable universe    we have access to. To understand what an “irrational” universe would be like, consider these thought experiments:

* What if gravity switches between pulling and pushing completely randomly?
* What if fire switches between generating and absorbing heat completely randomly?
* What if the Earth changes its shape between sphere, cubicle, pyramid, flat, cylinder, etc completely randomly?

When you consider these possibilities you will see how impossible it is for us humans the way we are now to live in such a universe.

Personally I prefer to understand Logos as a combination of mathematical rules (as opposed to linguistic rules) and natural laws (as opposed to man-made laws).

***The*** ***mind***

The ancient Stoics believed that the mind was purely physical ([source](https://iep.utm.edu/stoicmind/#SH2a)). Scholars haven't reached an agreement on whether this means strictly what we now call “[materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism)” or something else entirely. Regardless of what this belief should be called, they agree the Stoics believed the mind is a thing that is made up of physical materials and thus follows the physical laws of the universe.

What this means is the mind isn’t only capable of comprehending the “rationality” of the universe, it operates based on the same “rational” principle itself. The short version of the Stoic theory of mind in relation to this principle is as follow:

* We perceive external stimuli in the form of perceptions.
* We combine these perceptions with our existing beliefs (which by themselves are formed through the same “rational” principle) to form judgements (or also called impressions).
* Our emotions are a result of these judgements. Some think emotions are how the mind perceive the judgements (or how the judgements “feel”), some think they are caused by the judgements, some others think they are side-effects (or by-products) of judgements. In any case there is an inseparable link between our judgements and emotions.

There is much more to the Stoic theory of the mind but for the purpose of this post this short description will suffice. The important lesson we want to take from this is that our judgements and emotions are caused by the application of our reasoning process when combining our perceptions of reality with our existing beliefs.

***Change***

With the knowledge of how the mind works in Stoicism, the question that follows is how do we change our emotions? Given that emotions are caused by 2 factors (or variables): our beliefs and the facts about reality (our circumstances), it logically follows that our emotions will change if and only if there are changes in those factors.

As a software engineer, when I learned about the Stoic theory of mind I immediately related it to how I have always approached my software. The software is programmed in a certain way (my beliefs), this programming reflects my understanding of the business requirements, the programming operates on fundamental mathematics and logic (Logos). Given a set of input (circumstances) the software always produces the same set of output (emotions). If the output doesn’t match my expectation (a bug in software engineering terms), then I will proceed to think about whether I should change my input or my programming, or both (sometimes I also change business requirements, but that also falls under changing my ""beliefs"").

If you can’t relate to my software analogy, try to think of it like a mathematical function f(x) = y, where:

* f denotes a transformation function which contains formulas (beliefs), which adhere to mathematical laws (logos) such as commutative, associative, distributive, and so on.
* x is a variable (circumstances).
* y is the result of transforming x with the function f (emotions).

This means if you want a different result, let’s call y’, you have to change either the input to x’, or the function to f’, or again both.

If it’s still hard to relate, let’s try another analogy. Suppose you want to get inside a room behind a closed door. You turn the knob clockwise. You pull it inwards and it doesn’t open. At this point you can try one of the followings if you still want to get inside the room:

* Turn the knob anti-clockwise.
* Push the door outwards.
* Assert if it’s possible that the door is locked from the inside, if so:
   * Is there a keyhole, and if so where is the key?
   * Is there an alternative way to get inside the room without going through that door (is there a side entrance, a window with which you can climb into the room, and so on)?
* ~~Kick it open.~~

In summary, the point I’m trying to make with this post is that if you feel a certain way about something and you want to change how you feel, then you have to change something that directly contributes to how you feel about it, be it your beliefs or the thing itself. If you change neither and insist on seeing a change in how you feel, you will certainly fail because you will be trying to fight against the laws of the universe. It will be like repeatedly hitting the switch of a broken light bulb hoping that eventually it will light up.",Stoicism,1701595664.0,t3_189q0lt,0.89,26

Structure of Courage. Structure of Action. Structure of the Hero (as in the Hero's Journey).,"Not a newbie here.

I consider myself a Stoic practitioner, not perfect, but Stoic nonetheless.

I write. I write a lot, I have been writing all my life. More recently, I have been thinking/writing about the Archetype of the Hero's Journey, about taking Action, and about Courage.  To me these three concepts are all interconnected, intertwined, correlated and causative.

Today I am stuck with coming up with the *structure* of Action and/or the *structure* of Courage. They might be the same.

1. What do you understand about Stoicism/ Stoic teaching?—Even if it’s very little (e.g. you saw a Stoic quote on social media once)

2. How, if applicable, do you apply it in your own life?—Do you think of it as entirely realistic and achievable, or do you struggle with it at times?

How to reconcile this?,"Stoicism says you can only control your internals like your own thoughts, actions & reactions.

But are we truly in control of our thoughts & actions? Our actions at any given moment are influenced by so many factors like our general upbringing, our traumas, desires, aversions, our surrounding environment, our biological disposition  & many more and most of these factors are beyond our control. 

Same goes for our thoughts.

Then how am I really in control of my thoughts and actions?

Even me stumbling upon ideas of stoicism wasn't in my control. One day Youtube decided to recommend me a video of stoicism and that point I was in a mood to watch a self help video.

So at best Stoicism can be an emotion management tool which requires many perceptual adjustments to really internalize it in one's life.

Struggling with sexual desire and buying sex,"Although sex is a normal thing, as a single virgin 28M am struggling with it. Ideal solution would be to have a stable relationship with someone, and i can do it if i pursue. But i come from a conservative background where my parents won't accept it. I have been seeing a few woman online chat/call upon their recommendation, but i live in abroad (in a more liberal society), so the communication gap with the other people matters a lot. I have been away from my family over 5 years. I do need physical affection and love and hug in this single life (friends are not enough). I don't see myself getting married soon, and i have been seriously considering buying instead of wasting my 20s youth time just like that. Can’t deny that this sex drive may have affected my work. Ethically i am against porn and trafficking. But i am not sure what would be of me if i buy sex. In the end, i don't think i will find any open-minded woman who will accept my ""past sex-buying"" experience.

I'm afraid of losing my income. How do I redirect my thoughts?,"I know that it's outside of my control, regardless of how hard I work and perform, I could still lose my income.

My problem is that I feel that this fear is preventing me from applying to other companies because I start imagining scenarios where I wouldn't fit in and get fired from that new company.

I'm considering applying to other companies because
(1) the commute could be better
(2) I could probably earn more
(3) I feel like I will never be promoted at this company, as my application was rejected twice already in the past two years.

So, then I start rationalizing how my one hour commute is not that bad, how my salary is relatively decent and that I don't want to take on more responsibilities and lose little work-life balance I have.

Should I not fix it, if it ain't broke? Is there an alternative approach? Or is it simply about having more courage and embrace the possibility that the new job would suck and/or I could lose my income?",Stoicism,1701572268.0,t3_189jwiv,0.67,5
Is stoicism working for you?,"Don't know when you guys realized that stoicism is really helping you, but for me it clicked when I realized a few years ago that I was no longer overly afraid to die. 

&#x200B;

I used to struggle with the idea that I was sick with something, any tiny symptom that I had I would think I had some sort of bad cancer. Practicing negative visualization in the beginning helped me big time with that, only 10 minutes every morning, but making it a routine. It helped me understand that during the day when any negative thought came I didn't need to think about, I could simply talk myself into waiting for tomorrow's session. I realized I was becoming a much less anxious person, to the point now that I have to, for example, to do the opposite and force myself to go to the doctor to have some regular checkups, otherwise I won't even bother.

&#x200B;

It's still not perfect though, I still struggle at work, for example, to keep it cool when I'm confronted with something, when my boss does something I don't like... I still let this kind of stuff get to me. Even though it is a little better, I still see this as a big area of improvement. I can't for example receive an email that triggers some reaction on me, put it on my to do list, and carry on with the next task. I keep thinking about it until I reply it, and sometimes my answer is not the greatest as I'm still emotional when I reply to it.

&#x200B;

Obviously I know I will never be a sage, there are some areas where you excel, others that you find more difficult, but after 5 years practicing stoicism, I can say that it really helps me big time, and it completely changed my life for the best. It gave me tools to deal with frustrations and difficulties, and I'm grateful even for the simple fact that it made me think about how I behave, ways I could improve myself to make my life and my loved ones better.

"""In the void is Virtue, and no evil""_Miyamoto Musashi","I've long felt that there were alot of similarities between Miyamoto Musashi's Infinite Success and Marcus Aurelius' Meditations. Maybe it's because of ""take up the attitude of the sun"" and ""to watch the courses of the stars as if you revolved with them"". Lines that standout for me in both books and to me appear to be talking about the exact same thing in the exact same way. Musashi while talking about the void in that book says ""..it is where there is nothing...it is not contained in man's knowledge."" I guess i feel like the body of knowledge of Stoicism is incomplete (I wouldn't know, I haven't read every Stoic text ever written)because of the absence of sages among us everyday. But someone wrote a comment on  here sometime that made me think Stoic Sages are all around us, but we would never know they are here because they are doing their job well.(Like the Oracle when she tells Neo, that there are programs running all over the place, programs to control the sun, the wind, and that the one's doing what they were meant to do, we would never know they are were here). To get to the void Musashi writes that ""..polish the two fold spirit heart and mind"", for which Stoicism as I've come to know it is the best substance for that. And to ""..sharpen the twofold gaze perception and sight"", which to me means understanding the origin of my mother tongue(Luganda).

Does Stoicism Accept Suicide?,"Julius Caesar ended him. George Washington wanted to be like him.

Cato The Younger, the most Stoic of the Stoics, decided to die instead of living under a dictator.

But was his death against Stoicism's main idea?

Cato, when he realized Julius Caesar was going to win the war and become the sole ruler of Rome, went to his room.

There, with the noises of fighting men and death clouding his ears, he sat down to read some Plato.

Soon after, the time had come.

Cato took his sword and stabbed himself in the stomach deep enough to feel it, but not deep enough to kill him.

When his son and some of his soldiers entered the room, they found Cato hurt and bloody but not dead.

So they did what any good son and ally would do: they tried to save him.

But then, Cato did the unthinkable.

He was so committed to his cause, or so blinded and confused (I'll get to that in a second), that he disemboweled himself.

In plain English, Cato used his hands to take out his own guts and ensure certain death.

Not only is this a horrific way to die, but it also raises big questions.

Sure, I'm with Cato: this needs balls. To stand against a dictator and show your opposition with works, not words.

But why doesn't anyone comment on the fact that Cato went against Stoicism's most important idea: The Dichotomy of Control?

The fact that Julius Caesar was going (he didn't) to become Rome's ruler was out of Cato's or anyone's control.

Shouldn't Cato, as a Stoic, have accepted this course of events and done the best with what was given to him?

Of course, this brings new questions:

1. What if Caesar killed him? From historical references, Cato and Caesar did no hate each other. But I get that Cato would prefer to die out of his own hands.
2. The Stoics, and Cato as well, viewed life and death as indifferent. So they were fine with one ending one's life, only if the situation demanded it (sacrifice for the common good) or if their life was unbearable.

Detachment vs effort,"I'm making my way though Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus and reading a lot about the detachment from things we can't control. To me it sounds really similar to themes in Christianity and Buddhism and I really appreciate it and think this is a great way to live through adversity.

My quandary and the issue I have in applying it to my life has to do with the disconnect between detachment and creative effort. Despite being content with anything, stoics, I assume, still strive for things other than contentment? There is an imperative to ""live in accordance with nature/reason/God."" There is (even though the texts don't talk about it frequently) positive things we ought to do? Say I'm a husband and father (I am). Isn't it in keeping with stoicism that I provide for my family? Let's say I'm struggling to do that. I think the common stoic advice is to focus on the effort that I apply in this regard and accept that ultimately success is outside of my control. The idea is that I control my actions and not my situation.

The problem with that is it's only true in philosophy world. You absolutely DO have control over your success even if that control is partial and success can't be guaranteed. We are intelligent creatures and opportunities for creative solutions to our problems abound. The world is full of stories of people who thought their way out of difficult situations. Ok, but the stoics do say you can make the attempt so what's the issue? 

The issue is that trying to try isn't trying. One can only fully engage in difficult creative problem solving if they believe that the solution is within their control and they are attached to the outcome. No Olympic winner was just trying to try his best. They were trying to win. The investment in the outcome is necessary for the effort. I know from personal experience how much less likely I am to solve a technical problem I encounter if I think it might not have a solution. This is the opposite of the stoic advice which emphasizes acceptance of fate.

Confused about stoic view of love.,"I understand the logic behind how stoics say we should treat and view our relationships with our loved ones, as they are obviously not ours to possess and they can be taken away by circumstances, death or by their own choice. However, I still have a bit of a bone to pick with this attitude, as to my eyes it makes light of and minimizes the value of personal connections. If I am not attached to my brother or my child and they die, and I am not shaken or disturbed by their loss due to my lack of attachment, then did I truly love them? To me it seems like the pain of losing a loved one (whether to death, distance, a breakup, etc.) is not a bug or a problem of being too attached or possessive, but rather a simple proof of your love and value they had in your life. 

In short, if you aren't devastated at the loss of your child, did you really love them as a parent should love their child? If you lose something you value and it doesn't hurt, did you really value the thing you lost?",Stoicism,1701446105.0,t3_188f88g,0.93,13

Guilt over having a nice job,"This may sound stupid to some of you but I am genuinely needing some advice. I have a nice job, decent salary and the best part is it’s wfh. I get the work done on my own pace and take frequent breaks. I see so many people waking up at the crack of dawn to go to their very exhausting job. It makes me feel very guilty. I feel like I don’t deserve the things that I have when there are so many people that work so hard. My dilemma isn’t so much so the money I have, it’s more the comfort I get to experience and while others can’t. 



Does stoicism have any advice to offer for this situation?",Stoicism,1701420513.0,t3_18878d4,0.64,4
What difference does it make about the rationality of the universe?,"The ""The Practicing Stoic"", in Chapter 11, by Ward Farnsworth says:

gravitate toward virtue. these often are viewed as among the less enduring arguments

My question is that what difference does it make if nature is rational and providential? How does that add to the argument that nature commands us to live in obedience to reason and designed us to gravitate towards virtue? This question stems from the fact that even if our nature is to be rational, the question still remains: why should we live in accordance with nature?

Advice On Moving Out and Possibly Coming Out to Religious Family,"Hi there, I'm a 21 Y.O. male from the UK, and would like some advice when it comes to moving out from my family home and living independently.

I'm in a bit of a tough situation, as my parents and family are aware of my apathetic attitude towards Islam. They know that they'll have to continually force me to wake up for morning prayer, they know that most of my friends are non-Muslim and they know that me moving out could only mean that I'm looking to distance myself from them and the religion.

I know many others who've managed to gain independence once they've moved out for university, but since I've been working from home ever since I left high-school at 18, I've never been able to use the excuse that I'm looking to move out for work related reasons. They'll only accept me moving out once I've found a wife.

This is why I feel forced to come out to them and tell them that I'm no longer a Muslim, for the sake of my own sanity. I'm not sure what the best approach is when it comes to telling them I'm moving out, or that I'm no longer a practicing Muslim. I've accepted that my family would most likely disown me, but I find it hard not to feel responsible for the pain that I'm causing them.   


What is my duty to them as a son? And how should I navigate this situation?

Today marks 3 years since my mother's passing. Just looking for any good advice on grief and how to process it.,"I'm rather new to stoicism and been trying to learn as much as possible to get me out of this mental rut I've been in for a while now. Some days are better than others but this month has been hard as my mothers birthday is at the beginning of the month and then this is also the time that she caught covid and went through that battle before passing a few weeks later. It was such a rough time in my life. 

I know I still have a lot of stuff that I need to work through with it, years later and I still don't think I've really processed any of it. Just seeing the word ""Mom"" makes me want to shut down. I try not to let my grief get the better of me, I feel bad being so depressed and down on days like her birthday or during the holidays that she loved where I feel like I should be celebrating her life instead of sulking. Its just so hard to not feel crushed when I think about it all.

Stoicism and mental health.,"I wasn't sure of which tag to use so forgive me there. 

Im not clear on how to articulate my thoughts on this subject: I check this sub from time to time and what i find are in a lot of cases are questions that should be a simple answer: seek professional help. 

Correct me if im wrong but stoicism is a way to think about the world and your place in it. What it is not is a  sound system for dealing with the complex emotions of depression, thoughts of suicide or any other extreme mental health issues. 

My belief has always been that the people who struggle with stoic behaviors and or beliefs are not fit for stoicism. Again correct me if im wrong.

the thoughts are winning this week and I feel like I wanna disappear just to see how others will react,"I've struggled with depression and loneliness for years, it comes and goes in waves.

This past week its all coming back full force. The morning car ride to work is filled with these ""what ifs,"" the car ride home is the same, and I spend half my night just fantasizing about how others will react, if they even care, or even what I would write on a note and who I would mention kinda thing. Who I would thank, who I would ignore...

I dont really plan on doing it, but I cant help but fantasize about it.

The very worst part is that I have a bunch of people that seem to truly really care about me. I dont feel it much from my parents or brother, they're a very ""buh tough love"" type bullshit, but I feel it from my friends and even coworkers. Kinda sad that I feel closer and more accepted and cared for from my coworkers than my own family but it is what it is.

I have friends that reach out and invite me to things, I know they'd care. There are a few coworkers that would care.

But I keep having these doubts and insecurities about it. I always seek reassurance and even when I get it I still have trouble accepting it.

I always overthink things and come to the worst conclusions first. Literally like 95% of my overthinking's have been wrong. I see something and immediately think these people are ghosting me or talking shit or lying to me or whatever and then later I find out the truth and it really was something completely innocent and unrelated to me.

Its always the same pattern but I cant ever trust or accept that everything's fine.

I ALWAYS seek out the worst in situations even though it pretty much never happens. Like I said, just about 95% of my insecure overthinking is wrong, but every time I get a inkling of doubt I come to the shittiest conclusion and stress myself out.",Stoicism,1701337607.0,t3_187ewam,0.92,32

I'm supposed to protect him from the dangers of this world but I can't even protect him from my fucking self. I don't mean to hurt him in any way possible but it seems like I keep unintentionally damaging him. I don't know what to do. Just an hour ago i was attempting to get him off my bed so that he can go to his as it's night time and I didn't want him to get scolded(he has a tendency to take forever to get on the bed) and I thought he got his footing when I lifted him up but he didn't. He fell backwards in a kneeling type position and then he fell back and hit his head hard. The sound was fucking horrifying. As he hit his head he cried Mama! Mama! Man that was fucking hard to listen to man 😢. Then he started crying and I held him up. He held his head as he was crying and I don't know what to fucking do man, i feel so fucking guilty. He's okay now and is on his bed but there's this huge bump that hurts on his head and I just can't keep myself together when i think about it. Not the first time he's hit his head because of me and i didn't mean to. I never mean to and yet he still gets fucking hurt. I've never had thoughts about ending my life and I never will but i just think i might. Thank God 🙏 he was seen to by my mom and is okay now but I don't know, i don't know what to do.


Hey guys I appreciate the comments. The reason why I needed to get it out was because it's not the first time I accidentally hurt him when I had no intention to.

Is the heroic masculine purpose equivalent to the pursuit of Stoic moral virtue?,"I just watched this video below and I cannot not see that there is a connection between the heroic masculine purpose themed in this deconstruction and the desire to live by Stoic virtues. Is there a connection? Are they the same thing? Is the heroic masculine purpose a real thing, and if so is there a place for it in Stoicism?

Part of the draw of Stoicism for me is, the desire to live a virtuous life. It oozes purpose. And to see that it permeates the idea of the masculine hero  in our popular culture shows that stoicism is mainstream yet undefined as such or masquerading as a hero's journey.

I never hold grudges. Am I a pushover or am I just being wise?,"Since I was very young, I’ve always resonated with the quote “Holding Onto Anger Is Like Drinking Poison and Expecting the Other Person to Die”

I sometimes temporarily get really sad or heartbroken or disappointed. But I rarely get too angry. Whenever someone does me wrong, I always try to see things from their perspective. 

I have zero malice or anger towards any ex lovers or ex friends. Often, I’ll even still have a little love for them. Some of them, if they have really betrayed my trust and try to get back into my life, I will say no because I don’t want to feel the pain of getting hurt again. That’s only if I feel like they are untrustworthy but not because I feel anger or resentment towards them. But it takes alot for me to even feel this. 

I worry that sometimes I am too forgiving and I wonder if I am just being too complacent and not able to think to see my worth by being too empathetic. 

So back to my question - am I just being a pushover or am I taking a mature stance on situations like this?

Also I am reminded by this quote by Epictetus, “Any person capable of angering you becomes your master; he can anger you only when you permit yourself to be disturbed by him.”

What should i keep in mind during these hard times?,"Im a 17 year old boy and im facing the lowest point of my life so far. 

I want to survive this painfully subjective pain but for context, it all started when my girlfriend of 18 months cheated off on me and treated me in a way such that even my counselor thinks that i’m emotionally abused. After all of those, my mind wouldn’t align with my emotions. I know i deserve better (probably attachment issues) but i still long for her.Fast forward, my parents went through divorce— my mom cheating on my stepfather. It felt painful as well as it somehow a cause of my relapse from the break up i had with my cheater gf. Though im getting through the intricate pain it confronts me with, I feel either nothing or disdain towards my mother. My brother and I are to meet the new guy my mom’s with.

The environment im in isn’t much that of a niceplace, relatives that surround are quite loud and impatient (it runs in our blood) everything’s stressing me out i tend to just sleep throughout which is counterproductive especially that i base off my self worth on my academic performance (this is probably due to how  some people especially my ex and her friends belittling me, breaking off because i wasn’t “out of their league” after all the efforts and care I gave her throughout.)

The little irritations,"Hi, people, in the last month I developed a passion for stoicism and I started reading and learning more about this philosophy. In addition, I do journalling from time to time, however, I have one issue in my character that is constantly making me unhappy.

I get angry or irritated by small stuff, which most of the time are IN my control. I have already been able to let go of trying to control events that I have no control over. ( “The more you seek to control external events, the less control you will have over your own life.” Epictetus)

I can describe myself as a more clumsy person. Sometimes when I drop on accident an item on the floor or get stuck in traffic, I get angry.. When I feel exhausted at the office, I get angry... I believe that life is too short to be angry at things that do not influence me in a direct way or my family. My father most of the time is nervous and I got that trait from him, I guess, when I was growing up. Do not get me wrong.. I have no hate against other individuals and I am a person who forgives very easily (This is something that really brings me joy by the way.)

Know that IT WILL BE DONE.

New to Stoicism: Found my role model public figure,"I (38 M) am relatively new to Stoicism. I have been aware of the general concept for a while, but I have recently started reading credible modern works and scratched the surface of the original classic philosophical writings.

I have been thinking about modern role models who exemplify Stoicism in their daily lives and conduct, in an attempt to study their behavior and learn from real-world examples in today's society. I immediately ignored all the online influencers who peddle a modern alpha-male view of Stoicism and say that we should all be stone-faced and emotionless and work our our thoughts in the gym. 

After thinking for a while, I have settled on Queen Elizabeth II as a role model. She seems to have implemented Stoicism quite successfully in her life, both in public and private. First of all, she is a model of duty and service. Unlike the modern stone-faced take of Stoicism, Queen Elizabeth exhibited many emotions in public, including joy, sadness, frustration, strength, and compassion. It is clear to me however, that her persona and public display of emotion were backed by deep thought and consideration of an appropriate reaction to events. There are times when she cried or wiped away tears in public, both in reaction to national and personal tragedies. There are times where she also exhibited immense joy in public, again both in reaction to personal and national events. 

As somebody whose personal life was on national display and under scrutiny, it makes sense that her actions were the result of reflection and consideration. With the stress of international politics, a dissolving empire and modernizing world, wars, family strife, and everything else that comes with being Head of State, I think that Queen Elizabeth would never have been so successful or popular had she not implemented principles of Stoicism, whether deliberately or not.

I am trying to draw lessons from her life as an example for me. While our situations are obviously very different, I think that I can still learn lessons. I have three kids, a wife, a stressful job with long hours, and finances are always on my mind. It has become harder and harder to manage my responsibilities, the needs of my family, and everything else that life throws at me.

Delving into classical Stoicism over the past few months has helped me realize that how I instinctually react to situations was not the example of rational consideration that I am trying to teach my children.

Epictetus on Adultery,"Hi guys, there’s this one Discourse of Epictetus where he talks about Adultery. I believe it’s 2.4 “Against a person who had once been detected in adultery”. I’m very surprised at how ruthless he is towards Adulterers. He sounds so 💅sassy💅.It’s just bar after bar after bar:

“Wherein shall I trust you? So if you were an utensil so worthless that a man could not use you, you would be pitched out on the dung heaps, and no man would pick you up. But if being a man you are unable to fill any place which befits a man, what shall we do with you? For suppose that you cannot hold the place of a friend, can you hold the place of a slave? And who will trust you? Are you not then content that you also should be pitched somewhere on a dung heap, as a useless utensil, and a bit of dung? Then will you say, “no man cares for me, a man of letters?” They do not, because you are bad and useless. It is just as if the wasps complained because no man cares for them, but all fly from them, and if a man can, he strikes them and knocks them down. You have such a sting that you throw into trouble and pain any man that you wound with it. What would you have us do with you? You have no place where you can be put.”

Just want some of your thoughts on it/if it stood out to you during your read. Didn’t know daddy Epictetus gets down like that.",Stoicism,1701154663.0,t3_185pyuj,0.9,45
Can I be a good stoic?,"The title says it, I want to know if it is possible for me now to be a good stoic. The biggest problem I have personally comes from my past. 

I have been bullied for a few years after the divorce of my parents. New Town, new school, new kids, at 7 years old. I am 26 years old now and I have zero friends. I have some people I talk to and I am social enough to have conversations and do my work right. But I am not someone that opens up or trusts people very quick, thus having no real friends. 

I understand where this problem comes from and I know humans need social contacts and I know that it is for the best to help others, because that is a person's goal in this life, but somehow I feel like I can't do it 100% right because people gave me this trauma in my past and it may always be a scar.

I don't feel like I need, or even want, friends or lots of people I can trust, but isn't that a bad way to think? On the other hand, i do enjoy helping others and seeing others happy. It is sometimes a difficult thought process in my own head and I'm a little stuck on what is right ot how to handle it more stoic.

I hope to get some knowledge on how to maybe deal with it or just some overal feedback would be appreciated!",Stoicism,1701196405.0,t3_186323l,0.8,6
What to do with the regret and sadness of what happened in the past?,"I would like some advice, and I am hoping you Stoics have some food for thought on my problem:

  
I went to grad school in a different country 10 years ago, and during those two years, I had a personal fallout with a person that affected me so strongly, that I started to develop a depression that would take me about 5 year to finally start getting out of. During my studies, I did not develop deep friendships, as I began to withdraw from people due to my mental state. I moved away after graduating, and moved to another country and capital city. There I struggled with my depression for 4 years and then moved back to my own country. Here in my own country, I started to get better and have with the help of psychology left my mental problems behind.

My challenge is that I still feel a deep sadness for what I lost during those 5 years of depression - no university friendships, not even strong friendships in the capital city that I lived in for 4 years (as I was coping with my condition and couldn't get close to people) - and now, in my mid 30s, see that most people my age have their great university friends and friends from living abroad - and feel that I am constantly being confronted with my ""wound"". I guess I regret that what happened happened, and I wish things had been different.

What can I do? I even find myself meeting people who studied at my grad school (not at the same time, but it's a famous school) and I feel deeply sad and also a bit shameful when we have to ""share"" experiences and they tell me about all their great times and now life-long friends.

I thought about starting a new grad school experience, but since most people would be in their 20s, I have a gut feeling that it would not make good what happened back then... I guess that I am longing for going back to that time and relive it again, this time changning it, but because I am older now, that is not possible for me.

I guess I am often in a mental frame of ""if only it had been different"". Any thoughts?",Stoicism,1701203570.0,t3_1865xio,0.85,5

"question regarding Epictitus, religion and God","TL/DR: How do those of you who are atheist or agnostic deal with Epictitus teachings regarding God ?

so ive been practicing stoicism for a couple years. ive read Seneca, M.A, and the Enchiridion with some selected writings from the Discourses thrown in. Recently i picked up a full length version of Discourses. Epictitus talks a lot about God. we should follow God, man is the rational beast that got the gift to make use of impressions from God. etc.

While i have my own spiritual beliefs, i've never been okay with the idea of GOD. one God, one creator, calling God 'he'.

so my question is mostly aimed at atheists and agnostics; How do you get around Epictitus \~preaching\~ about God in this way. I like his teachings but i just dont vibe with the idea of God like he does.

i dont want to hear quotes, im interested in ya'lls personal opionions

"Stoicism, Working Hard & Cancer","I am 35 years old and last year I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. It was big, but fortunately not that dangerous. I went through the thyroid removal procedure and then radioactive iodine therapy. I had a checkup in may and I have a more serious checkup in January. 

I afraid of this checkup. 

In general my illness affected my thinking about life. On one hand it taught me to enjoy everyday life and not to wait with my plans (for example travelling). On the other it affected my plans and ambitions in the negative way. 

What's the point of investing and saving money seriously if I my life can be ended soon? What's the point of learning new things if I could spend this time enjoying myself. What's the point of taking life seriously? 

In general for me it's constant thinking about my mortality (memento mori). It's like having grim reaper standing behind me all the time. unfortunately it's not a fully positive motivation for taking actions. It's rather demotivating me.

How do I be a mentally tougher person?,"I find myself getting triggered often, most of the time by things that are just in my own mind (past events or dwelling too much about what someone said). I've been very isolated for the most formative years of my life (homeschooled and basically neglected at home through my entire teen years up until I became 18, went to college and got a job). Life was too much to take all at once I guess and I wasn't prepared. I guess the only real way to recalibrate is to sink or swim but after going through a traumatic experience I've isolated myself more or less completely once again, I guess because that's the only place I feel safe or familiar in. Even before then I had also had bouts of isolation.

I just don't want to be such a pussy anymore. I feel like I'm easily influenced by those around me especially my parents who have labeled me a lot of negative things. I feel like I'm still a child not an adult. I've worked and I've travelled, and I am pursing a degree, but I feel like something is missing and I don't like being so weak.

Staying grounded around immoral people/rulebreakers,"Living in NYC, I often feel surrounded by immoral people and rule breakers which makes  it difficult to maintain inner peace for me. There are many instances throughout the day where someone breaks rules and it personally affects me; I’ve been struggling to find a way to stand up for myself, but also be able to let things go.

Some basic examples:
- I am waiting in line to board the bus and before I get on, someone tries to cut the line. I will make sure they are not able to cut in front of me, but it leads to verbal conflict and I tend to carry that with me (i.e. replaying it in my head all night)
- When crossing the street, a car runs a red light and almost hits me then shouts something at me. I also carry this with me—mostly the frustration that they don’t see what they did as wrong. If I impulsively react back to them, I often feel guilt for not ignoring them.
- While commuting, witnessing people driving illegally on the shoulder or wrecklessly cutting others off; it tends to make me upset, and wish there was more enforcement of the rules. 

What are some ways to work through this where I still feel able to assert myself, but can also let the event go without any further thought? I feel like if I do not stand up for my beliefs, I will become a pushover for the sake of taking the path of least resistance.

Even the smallest task feels like a burden. I end up feeling nervous and stressed. I can't remember anything about anything; when I look back, all I see is darkness. I never achieved anything in my life,and to this day, I'm just a failure.

I have no job,no skills,the exam I was preparing for,I haven't studied for it from past 7 months,and I know I'm gonna fail , it's a national level exam and I wasted my time,I spent the whole year(2022) covering the syllabus and in the last crucial 7 months I fucked up,I didn't realise when the time passed by,I kept comparing my progress with others,I kept focusing on what others have and where I lack, the exam is in 1 month now,I don't remember anything I studied,sooo much of my syllabus is left , I'm gonna fail ,I can try next year,but it's not going to be easy because everyone is going to be making fun of me,my parents are going to be disappointed,I saw this coming, it's my fault and now I don't have the courage to face it ,to accept that I failed.

Now I'm left with nothing, and it's clear to me that after my graduation (after 5 months), I will have to sit at home. This eats me alive,it kills me,my parents are going to be so disappointed. Everyone is having the best time of their lives, and I'm a failure with no goal, confidence, skill, or talent in my life. Nothing excites me, nothing is interesting, and everything is turning gray. 

During my graduation period,I spent my time studying for uni exams, didn't make any friends, not even a bf, never got into illegal stuff,and I still failed,guess I was born to be a failure.

I have no friends , no one that I can share my feelings with, and I have always bottled up my feelings. To be honest,  I don't even know why I'm writing all of this here; nobody is even going to read it. I guess I'm just so desperate; every day is the same; every day I fail; every day I go to bed feeling like a burden; every day I feel others judging me and making fun of me; every day I fear my parents reaction; every day I'm a loser with nothing to offer and nothing to live for.

I don't feel like getting out of my bed,I just don't feel like doing anything.

How do I find my destiny?,"Hi guys, I’m 24 living in the UK and have been in a job for 6 years which isn’t that well paid but the company is really good and the people I work with are nice. I would say I’ve been in a comfort zone for ages now so from last year I have been looking for a new job, starting the gym going 6 times a week, feeling a lot better in myself and have been upskilling myself by doing courses outside of work ect. However recently I’ve had a knee operation and I feel like I’m back to square one. 

The main reason for this post is there’s so many different paths I could go down, how do I know I’m taking the right one to find my destiny/full potential?

1. Part of me thinks I could go to Uni (I didn’t go to begin with because I didn’t know what I wanted to do and I still don’t so I feel like it could be a waste of money)

2. Keep trying to find a new job- one that could solidify me into my 30s, so that I can afford to move out and eventually have a family.

3. Go travelling (people say you learn a lot and I agree but I don’t know how this will help me find a job in the long term)

All I want in life is to find peace, retire my parents, become the best version of myself but I genuinely don’t know what I want to do and feel a bit lost. It’s such a shame because I’m so flexible right now I would go anywhere in the world and start a job if it meant a great opportunity.

"How to deal/handle those things that you can't control, but will happen sooner or later?","I want to learn more about the things i can't control and how to deal with them. I see lots of youtube videos about stoics. Nobody of them say/tell how to deal with those things that is out of control but eventually they will happen. 

For example, if someone close to you is diagnosed with a cancer or you are diagnosed with cancer, things won't be in your favor or anyone favor.  Once that happen, doing all of those treatments, anxiety, depression, anticipatory grief, things can turn to the worse in one way or another.

"Stoicism seems to be, above all else, about reasoning.","Hello everyone, hope you're doing well today and, if you celebrate it, had a Happy Thanksgiving. I've been studying Stoicism more in depth for the first time lately, and I've read Meditations and currently am reading ""How To Think Like A Roman Emperor"" by Donald Robertson. Before this I've only known it through posts on this sub, quotes, and Youtube videos. The main thing I always heard about it is that it's about accepting what you can't control, and while that seems to be a big part of it, I think the main part of it is just relying on your own mental faculties and abilities to reason.

For instance, in Meditations(Gregory Hays version), Marcus constantly mentions the ""Logos"", which in the ancient Stoic view is the rational force that governs the Universe, and on a personal level, is the use of logic and reason itself. The first part of 3.5 states one should ""never act under compulsion, out of selfishness, without forethought, or with misgivings"". It's even more apparent in 3.11, where he mentions that ""Nothing is so conducive to spiritual growth as this capacity for logical and accurate analysis of everything that happens to us"".

In Donald Robertson's book, I learned about the ""Stoic model of emotion"" as described by Seneca in ""On Anger"", which says we go through three stages. The first is the initial impression of an event, like, ""The boat is sinking"", which naturally invokes anxiety. The second is when we start ""catastrophizing"", or creating value judgements in our head like ""I'm going to die a horrible death"", which is a completely separate activity from the first event and is entirely made from our own imagination. In this stage, after we recognize our natural feelings, we should look for ways to improve our situation, or at least recognize that panicking won't help. If you can't do this, then you will enter stage 3, and start panicking and acting without reason, which is fully based on your assumptions of the initial event.

So in conclusion, accepting events as they are is important, but the main idea seems to be able to analyze those events and be able to view them in an objective manner so that you can handle them in a calm and rational manner.

How to deal with the parts of our mind we can't really control?,"A short preface:

My former co-workers pulled a very, very rude move towards me. It was an unprovoked, unprofessional, entirely unnecessary and petty situation. But, I don't blame them and I don't think they are bad people. I recognize that they are simply very misguided. I knew that even before. They act contrary to the human nature, and, in the long run, by their antisocial actions, they hurt only themselves. 

I consulted the situation with my current boss. She is a really wise person and I am grateful for having her around. She advised me how to deal with the situation in a very professional, elegant, and, actually, a very stoic way, and I did so. Therefore, I think I dealt with the problem in the best way I could.

I recognize all these things as externals, and that I have zero control over them. This kind of situation happens, there are people who act like this, and that’s fine. They can try however hard they want, but they can’t hurt my faculty of choice. 

BUT, here is the problem. 

You probably heard about the concept of the monkey mind. It refers to all the spontaneous and random thoughts that appear constantly in our minds. There is a variety of meditative practices helping to calm down the busy monkey mind. 

The thing is, this little ugly animal that dwells in my skull literally went nuts during the three days spanning the situation I described. I constantly analysed and re-analysed what happened, and it was difficult for me to focus on any other things. As I wrote above, at the level of rational thought, either from the perspective of philosophy or from the perspective of everyday dealings, I knew perfectly that everything was ok, that it wasn't a big deal at all. Their petty scheme was revealed and I have the full support of my current boss. It couldn’t have gone better. But, the less rational, or maybe, the emotional part of my mind couldn’t settle. 

Here are my questions to you guys.

Seneca wrote that the greatest remedy for anger is delay. What I felt wasn’t really anger, I felt simply bad. Just bad and tired. Do you think that time is the best remedy for all the feelings and thoughts we can’t control? Maybe you know some other ways to deal with this? I can’t simply say to myself ‘stop thinking about it’ and, well, stop thinking. It doesn’t work this way. Is distracting myself with other activities and just waiting the only option?

The thing that has been bothering me from the very beginning of learning about Stoicism is this: the Stoics wrote a lot that (if I understand it correctly, of course) the only thing we control in its entirety is our faculty of choice. But, as we all experience, our thoughts aren’t completely under our control. So, should we treat our thoughts as, basically, externals? Or maybe there are two categories of thoughts, our rational thoughts and the monkey mind’s, external thoughts? If so, where is the boundary?

What are your thoughts about these problems, guys?

Am I Doing The Right Thing?,"I know the title may seem vague, but let me give some context. I have recently been exposed to stoicism (via Daliy Stoic YT channel and reading Meditations) and been picking up what I have learned, such as controlling my emotions and understand others emotions, having self-discipline (having a morning routine set, working out, jorunaling, etc.), things we can and cant control, and always taking action. That is my level of experience atm.

For the situation, I have been living with my parents for most of my life and have been unemployed since April of this year, and have been looking ever since. I also about to take community college classes coming up in Jan (making a career change) and also looking for part-time job along with learning a new side hustle to have supplemental income till I find employment. My issue is that my mother complains to me whenever I am on the computer the whole day, bout how my dad is struggling to keep the boat afloat, and struggling with depression cause of me and brother not being on our own. Now here is where the title comes in. From what I have been learning bout stoicism, I have controlled my emotions and not lashing out at her for things I have been doing to get there. Also, I am telling myself that you are taking action with this situation that I am. So am I doing the right thing?

"Reflections on Meditations, 11.8","Hello!

I'm relatively new to Stoicism and wanted to share my reflections on a quote from Meditations 11.8:

""A branch cut off from the adjacent branch must of necessity be cut off from the whole tree also. So too a man when he is separated from another man has fallen off from the whole social community. Now as to a branch, another cuts it off, but a man by his own act separates himself from his neighbor when he hates him and turns away from him, and he does not know that he has at the same time cut himself off from the whole social system. Yet he has this privilege certainly from Zeus who framed society, for it is in our power to grow again to that which is near to us, and again to become a part which helps to make up the whole. However, if it often happens, this kind of separation, it makes it difficult for that which detaches itself to be brought to unity and to be restored to its former condition. Finally, the branch, which from the first grew together with the tree, and has continued to have one life with it, is not like that which after being cut off is then ingrafted, but it is something like what the gardeners mean when they say that it grows with the rest of the tree, but that it has not the same mind with it.""

When I first read Meditations, this quote reminded me of situations I've encountered throughout my life. The first time it happened was when my aunt divorced her husband. They stopped all communication, which is a horrible thing to do. This caused a chain effect where she also stopped communicating with the rest of his family and all of his friends. It was a major blow for our side of the family since we really liked those people and enjoyed hanging out together. As it became awkward to ignore the elephant in the room, our communication died out over time, and a decade later, we became strangers.

I often think about this quote, especially nowadays when ghosting has become a regular thing and what effect is has on society as a whole.",Stoicism,1700834740.0,t3_182sudb,0.94,14
Stoicism and ambition,"Can somebody practice stoicism and be ambitious at the same time? Stoicism encourages us to focus on character and becoming virtuous and considers external things, such as financial success and status, as unnecessary. By trying to have a successful career are you not placing value on external things like money and prestige ? Would a true stoic not chase these things, but not reject them either if they happened get them by chance?",Stoicism,1700830958.0,t3_182rmq5,0.89,13
Friendships,"Friendships are a gift and shouldn’t be taken for granted. As someone who grew up having separation anxiety, I clung to anyone who gave me any validation or comfort. I put my friends on a pedestal and was hurt a lot when they didn’t cherish me the way I did them, and that’s just because they were never really a true friend in the first place. An orphan growing up in the party scene of the early 2000s will do that to a young soul. I had one genuine friend who passed away suddenly very young, I believe we were just 20. I can’t remember exactly because it traumatized me so much I don’t remember much from that year and surrounding years are a blur. Since then I had trouble finding another friend like her who loved me as unconditionally as I did her. Since then I learned how to be alone and be a better friend, leaving behind my party friends and I found my loving husband in my mid 20s through one friend from my party life who managed to get out as I did, starting a band together and a new healthier lifestyle. I found stoicism through my now husband of 7 years.

I did eventually make a friend at 23 who I would have considered my best friend until just a few days ago who we shared much of the same values and loves as, but we grew apart over the last 10 years and now I just don’t know who they are anymore and it hurts me to be treated like a blip in someone’s mind when we used to be inseparable and almost psychically connected like siblings.

Our communication became more stagnant over 5 years,  by their needs, not mine. And when I reach out to check in on them it feels hollow and lonely because often their response is that they’re going through a lot and can’t hold space for me, even though it was just me who is doing the checking in on them. I know it’s a response that comes from “please don’t ask  because I can’t return the gesture right now” And that’s 90% of the few times I reach out. Still, as a friend, I don’t feel it right to stop checking on their wellbeing knowing they’re struggling so much, so I space it out a month-3 months at a time which apparently was still too much. The last check in was for their birthday, and was not met with any kindness unfortunately, just a flat “thank you” and another “I’m too burnt out to see how you’re doing, maybe another time.” Which I respond with another “that’s ok” but then retract because I need to be honest with myself this time, it’s not okay. They’re not okay.  I’m not allowed in, door shut in my face another time. They try to be there for moments of joy,  but they’re miles away and I can’t reach them no matter how much attention or space I offer. I understand their mental illness struggles deeply. I hold them above my own at times so that I can hold space for them but my well of nurturing has run dry because they didn’t help with refilling and I understand they know they can’t and that’s why I shouldn’t have kept trying.

I had reached a high point in my life the past year and I want to share my new found joys with them and share joyful life experiences without our previous trauma bond. (I’ve made new friends to share my joys with and have stopped forming relationships based on our past traumas, even though inevitably those traumas will be shared with each other because that’s how I know we’ve worked passed them and continue to hold our identities separate from those life changing experiences.) I want to believe we had a stronger bond than just that. They have been in a really bad place for a very long time and still getting worse, they don’t eat don’t sleep and had to have surgery unrelated but still alongside other health conditions. I pestered them a bit more than usual because I’m seriously concerned that they’re killing themself rapidly and not telling me what’s going on. I still haven’t been informed how their surgery went or recovery is going. 

It hurts but also I feel relieved. It’s a hard pill to swolllow and I’ll always love them and hope they can be healthy and happy again without me since I was clearly not the one that could be there for them no matter how much space and energy I reserved for them.

I told them I’ll always be there if they need but I can’t keep letting myself get hurt, confused and inevitably unfulfilled. It would be fulfilling if I was any help to bring them to a place of comfort but I’m afraid I don’t do that for them anymore. They don’t treat our friendship as a therapeutic relief like we used to. We used to talk through our issues, thought processes, creative processes together often on hikes through the hills and sometimes just making art together. Alone but together, I call it. I’ll always cherish those days. Where they are now is not where I am welcome anymore and that’s okay. I’ll never stop letting people into my life just because of this experience, always fate permitting. 

They want to talk about it another time and says I’m still family to them, which I concur.  

Either way, I’m at peace with it now to just let go in stillness, but is there anything more I should’ve done or should do at this point while still protecting my heart?",Stoicism,1700843322.0,t3_182vxa5,0.75,8

"Does the lack of ""good"" and ""evil"" and the existence of Justice as a cardinal virtue oposse each other?","I can understand all other cardinal virtues. Temperance and Courage are quite self-explanatory and easy to understand.

Wisdom is harder, but this quote summarizes it pretty well I think:

>*“The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control. Where then do I look for good and evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but within myself to the choices that are my own”* — Epictetus

So wisdom is basically the understanding of dichotomy of control, virtues - vices and indifferents.

But Justice just looks like Catch 22.

You need to be ""good"" (perfect, virtuous) to be able to make rational and perfect decisions. But to do that, you need to have perfect virtues. But how are you going to act just when you don't have the ability what is just because you are not perfectly virtuous and cant make the perfect judgment?

**So - what is Justice?**

Can someone please just hint at what should ""**Justice**"" be? I read a lot about it, but the best explanation I could come up with was ""do things for the common good"" or - ""do good things"". It is supposed to be the most important virtue, but the concept eludes me.

One person says justice is about symphaty and love, other one is giving example of going to literal war. The best these explanations can do is give bunch of examples that show Courage, but not Justice. The only things those examples have in common is usually people a) doing what they thing is right and b) they are judged as moral by today's moral lenses.

So is ""being just"" simply acting in such a way that you think is right? That is, regardless of what would ""objectively"" be just if you were omniscient?

Example: **I travel though time to try toilets in 1939 (I am a historic toilet experience enjoyer). I meet a random person at the toilet and we make smalltalk, he gets a heart-attack and i save him.

A General Stoic Attitude (in summary),"**Source:** *From Theory to Practice: Exploring Stoic Pragmatism for a Life of Resilience and Significance*, MASTER’S THESIS IN PHILOSOPHY, by Max Giezen (Erasmus University Rotterdam, 2023), pages: 19-20.

The combined works of Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus give rise to a general Stoic attitude that offers valuable insights for living a fulfilled life. At its core, this worldview focuses on rational decision-making and the cultivation of personal virtues. By cultivating a steady mind and regulating our thoughts, we discover a harmonious balance within nature. It becomes essential to gracefully accept external circumstances as they unfold, while using our rational agency to effectively manage those aspects within our control.

There is a divine essence inherent in our being that serves as a guiding force for our ethical behavior when we align ourselves with it. Recognizing the interconnectedness of all living beings, we accept the responsibility to extend benevolence, affection, and cooperation to others. Serenity and inner peace become attainable through the practice of self-discipline as we strive to embody virtues such as wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice. These virtues not only contribute to personal excellence, but also play a vital role in the betterment of society as a whole.

Stoicism focuses our attention on the interconnected fabric of existence, urging us to acknowledge our place within the natural order and to detach ourselves from external outcomes. By fostering empathy, kindness, and forgiveness, we create an environment conducive to personal growth and transformation. By adopting the Stoic attitude, we embark on a journey of self-improvement and the pursuit of the common good. By adhering to these timeless principles, individuals not only gain wisdom, but also align their lives with the inherent harmony of the universe.

Cancer and Breakup,"Is there any stoic or non-stoic advice for me? 

about 5 months ago my ex broke up with me. I started studying stoicism and other schools of philosophy to improve myself and that helped. I am doing so much better than I was doing when the break up happened. But a couple of days ago she reached out to ask me to come pick up an old hoodie of mine. I told her she could throw it away but she refused so I agreed to come. During the time she chose to meet I had a job meeting which I couldn't skip so she said ""I'll come after my treatment"". Then I asked about the treatment and she told me she has stage 2 cancer.

Since then I have been feeling tired and sad all the time. I feel helpless and scared and I want to be there for her but I don't know how or if she even wants me to be there for her. I told her that even though we broke up that doesn't mean we can't be friends and told her that I am here for her and she said ""idm being friends"". This removed my doubts that she contacted me as a ""call for help"".  She doesn't care but I still do and I am scared that I would lose her without being able to spend more time with her. This situation brought back a lot of feelings that I thought were long gone. I feel like I still love her and care for her although she really messed me up in the past. I know I shouldn't focus on things I can't control but I feel like shit because of this and don't know how to stop thinking about it.

Thank you.

Accepting Who You Are,"I have figured out that certain things have become ingrained in my personality which I will not be able to change. To start with, I am an introvert, who has serious self-esteem issues. In every conversation ever, I am the person who nobody listens, ignores or taken care of. In my friend group, I am just a listener. And it has happened with me since childhood, to school, and now to college. Because of this isolation, I have very 'weird' interests as per freinds like philosophy, physics, biology, aviation, military, history, and in music I like metal song which everyone mocks me for. I am told multiple times that I live under rock, boring, or idiot. Also the fact I dont like to hurl abuses, and cannot take stand for myself, I am mocked heavily for it.

 I am ugly also and even has wrinkles hands at age of 18, as per conventional beauty standards of this shitty fuckin society. Every girl whom I talked to, or tried to talk always gave dry responses, ignores me or just... you can easily think. Nobody even boys have ever complimented me on my looks, or just whatever, even when I wear the best clothes. All of my friends have received such compliments from each other

Academically also, I am sufferring because I cant ace in exams, because I always study for knowledge and curiosity and not like to cram things.

I really want to accept myself and my body, accept the way I look, sound, talk and overall who I am. I have teared myself down so many times that I lost the count. I have to accept that I may be alone forever as many of my bullies I faced told me. I am just tired, I want to move forward, atleast I can ace academically, and become a physicist.

gratefulness post for Stoicism and it's creators.,"I am very grateful that I found stoicism in my life, it actually came into my life in the best time possible!  


I am a 23 year old male from Lebanon, after we faced an economical crisis in Lebanon where the prices of everything skyrocketed alongside the lockdown where many people sadly lost their jobs & people still working were paid much less that what they used to get. At that time I was still a student in the university & couldn't find a side job to help my family & get some for myself so I focused on studying. A while after that 2 close friends died from motorcycle accidents in the span of 9 months which affected my mental health and caused depression and I can't focus on anything including university.

Stoicism helped sooth my pain and lifted all that burden from my mind & made me stronger than ever! I regained my focus & became more interested in studying, I started hitting gym, I started to read Meditations, Enchiridion & Letters from a stoic. Most importantly it made my mentality harder & more tolerant to pain. 

&#x200B;

Thanks to those people, their art lifted me to the light when I was in the deepest darkness in my life (yet), and I hope I'll face & accept whatever fate is hiding for me.",Stoicism,1700658910.0,t3_1818v5s,0.93,41

Seeking Stoic Advice - Dealing with a partner with anger issues and swift mood changes.,"First of all, thank you for taking some of your time to read this and also; for any advice you can give me.

A little bit of background: I have been dating my girlfriend for 7 years now, we have lived together for 4 of those years; and even moved to Spain for the last two years. Since we became a couple, I've known she has a lot of trouble dealing with her emotions, anything that could be considered a ""bad"" emotion she expresses as anger; a very explosive and destructive one at times.

I have an anxious personality, so her mood swings really upset me; even though I try to stay calm and let her have some space to deal with her emotions. 

I took on Stoicism about a year ago, and it has really helped me deal with life: work, family, studies, and my relationship with her. I am trying my best to interiorize that there re things I cannot control, as in this case how she decides to react, and I can only control how I reply and act towards her anger. 

However, I feel like I am running out of energy to deal with this situation, things that are totally solvable make her rage, and my anxiety starts soaring. I just feel like I am on the verge of having an emotional breakdown myself. I some days find myself fighting with her inside my head since I wake up until we go to bed.

I really love this woman and want to have a future with her; however, her unstable emotional intelligence really makes it hard. Every plan we have gets torn to pieces as soon as she gets mad. I have tried recommending a psychologist but apparently, she does not feel comfortable opening up to a stranger.

A breakup that I never saw coming.,"A couple of months back, I (M) went through a break-up where I was told by her that it wouldn't last long as her family did not approve of us, (she is from a traditional background), During these periods we went back and forth understanding and figuring out, and obviously arguing a lot, at these time there was one of our mutual colleague who became quite close to her and when we finally decided to end it, I began to accept the reality and move on and stopped communicating with her, my absence ruined her social life, eating habits and talking phase, at one point she slept overnight in cafe's nearby just not to go back home - all because we were finally not together. As I had been in constant touch with Stoicism it kind of helped me get over it, but recently when I found out that she is dating the same guy I was kind of sceptic about, it broke me, I truly loved her and she did too, but knowing the fact that she is with someone else makes my stomach twist, my anxiety has peaked, not able to eat anything. I recently started jogging early morning, but coming back home makes me feel sick. Eating food has become a huge task, pukish and hard to even swallow with all the pain in my head.  
 I watch Ryan Holiday's video to get about my day but a sudden burst of emotions of thinking about what they both must be sharing, makes me sad, disheartened and low.  


I have an exam coming up later next year and I am staying at home preparing for it, realising that I don't have much to do except for studying staying at home will make me more anxious, and not earning definitely adds fuel to it, I've been a successful Product Manager in Tech and taking a year gap for studies with so much time left is something that I need help with.   


It's been quite dreadful for me and any good suggestions or help is more than welcome

Humiliated in work meeting - stoic approach to mindset,"Hi - seeking some guidance on the right stoic mindset I need to take to deal with this. I was in a work meeting with my boss and peers yesterday. I was asked a question about a matter I had been working on - it was, simplistically, the root cause / driver behind a new issue that has cropped up. I did not know the answer and felt like a total fool. My boss criticised me in front of the team “oh come on!” And I felt humiliated. What was worse, a colleague in the meeting googled the question and got an answer in about 3 seconds. The topic wasn’t difficult I just hadn’t thought about it, and on reflection I should have.  My confidence was really shaken for the rest of the meeting and when I spoke I sounded “weak” which just made it all worse. I cannot stop thinking about this scenario now over and over.

Control,"I’ve been reading and learning about stoicism for about 8 months now and my question relates to what we can and can’t control.

So what if your a control freak who, from many points of analysis, feel that in some regard we have some form of control over a lot of things?

Dead bodies in our water.,"Moderation, and perception heavily influence our experiences. 

“Who does not see that appetite is the best sauce? When Darius, in his flight from the enemy, had drunk some water which was muddy and fouled by cadavers, he declared that he had never drunk anything more pleasant; the fact was, he had never drunk before when he was thirsty.... Compare [to those who use moderation] those you see sweating and belching, being overfed like fatted oxen; then will you perceive that they who pursue pleasure most attain it least, and that the pleasure of eating lies in having an appetite, not in being glutted.” 

Cicero, Tusculan Disputations 5.97, 99-100

Additionally, this lines up with readings I’ve found from “Ghost Soldiers” by Hampton Sides, where pows captured in the Japanese occupation of the Philippines were denied food and water. As I recall the story, any one who halted the long march of the POWs were killed on the spot. When the column marched alongside a stagnant, dark, and fly infested puddle, one POW grew so desperate for a drink of water, that they launched themselves into the sludge. Which they were promptly killed by the Japanese forces. 

There may be a few instances like this in the book, from what I can recall. 

Yet this goes to show

1. If something is unpleasant, how much of our own perceptions of its negative connotations are playing into it?

2. When we have excess, our perceptions of how easily we can consume will cause even the best foods to taste average. 

This truth goes far beyond these ideas, and spreads into many of the experiences that humans go through. 

Such as the warm welcome that we would give our friends and family if they have been gone for many years, compared to the greetings we give to them each day when we are saturated by their presence.

Advice for someone overly aware of worldly issues.,"I have an annoying habit of reading the news, not just normal headlines, but also diving into regional news of various countries and also global climate news, it often depresses me and makes me anxious, hence why I've been looking into stoicism, I'm buying meditations and Massimo Pigliucci's handbook for new stoics, but I was wondering what advice you'd have for someone like me, or some exercises to keep my mind within a more reasonable scope.

Something that drew me to stoicism is when I heard it advises followers to worry only about things within ones control, which is something I sorely need to learn, I'm aware that outside of voting, there is little I can do for issues such as the climate, and for problems in other countries, there isn't anything I can do, so I know I shouldn't worry, but I feel almost addicted to depressing news.",Stoicism,1700593531.0,t3_180om6o,0.87,15
"Is this a good, concise explanation of Stoicism for someone looking to achieve a more peaceful mind?","1. Realise everything about yourself that you don’t like, slowly work these into a habit that works on them - unhappy with body weight/muscle? Do calisthenics, or start light with just walking everyday for a set amount of time. Unhappy about your level of knowledge - read books, pirate them even, it will help you. Struggling with school, this one really requires discipline as you must have a routine and follow  it, discipline can be built slowly too, start small by just doing the opposite of what your brain wants to do. You want to relax? Cardio and exercise, work or study - though this a routine can easily be followed. Also, delete TikTok, it is extremely predatory and people genetically predisposed to addiction must do this sooner than later.

2. Realise everything that you can’t control and cast it aside, this is hard at first but becomes easier and needs to be applied to even the simplest of things. Contrast the level of effort required with the “accusation” you mount against someone or something. For example, your teacher or boss is harsh, annoying or angry at you. Firstly, realise everyone is human and everyone is flawed. You cannot control them and they cannot control your thoughts. For the “level of effort” I was talking about, see what can be done to minimise this and see if it is realistic. Wanting to switch careers or jobs just because of one boss is quite drastic, but in a lot of circumstances it is understandable.

That’s about it, though I know generalised anxiety order exists and other mental illnesses like depression make this advice harder to achieve. Though this is mostly for myself. This is very pretentious and arrogant to say but like Marcus Aurelius and his journal Meditations, journaling your thoughts and meditating is very important, I and you must try each day to do something.

What guidelines can I follow to avoid a negative perception?","Edit: There's a lot of people thinking this was a genuine attempt to learn something from chathpt. It was not. These 2 topics were chosen to see if chatgpt would confuse them or blend them in an odd way.


I am trying to be a stoic person, but I am trying not to be a narcisst at the same time. What guidelines can I follow to avoid a negative perception. 

Striving to be both stoic and avoiding narcissism is a commendable goal, as these philosophies can compliment each other well. Stoicism encourages self-control, resilience, and a focus on what is within our control, while avoiding narcissism involves maintaining humility and considering the perspectives and needs of others. Here are some guidelines to help you navigate these principles:

1. **Practice Humility:**  


* Acknowledge your strengths and accomplishments without excessive pride.
* Recognize that everyone has strengths, and your worth is not solely determined by your achievements.

1. **Focus on Virtue:**  


* Follow the Stoic principle of focusing on virtues like wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance.
* Avoid seeking external validation and instead find fulfillment in living virtuously.

1. **Mindful Communication:**  


* Practice active listening and genuinely consider others' perspectives.
* Avoid dominating conversations and ensure that you give space for others to express themselves.

1. **Self-Reflection:**  


* Regularly reflect on your actions, motivations, and behaviors.
* Be open to constructive criticism and use it as an opportunity for personal growth.

1. **Empathy:**  


* Cultivate empathy towards others by trying to understand their feelings and experiences.
* Offer support and help when needed without expecting anything in return.

1. **Acceptance of Imperfection:**  


* Understand that nobody is perfect, including yourself.
* Embrace your flaws as part of being human and use them as opportunities for growth.

1. **Gratitude:**  


* Practice gratitude for the positive aspects of your life.
* Acknowledge and appreciate the contributions of others to your well-being.

1. **Moderation:**  


* Avoid excessive self-focus by maintaining balance in your pursuits.
* Cultivate self-discipline to prevent indulging in behaviors that may lead to narcissistic tendencies.

1. **Adaptability:**  


* Be open to change and adapt to new situations without clinging excessively to your own views or ways.

1. **Service to Others:**  


* Look for opportunities to contribute to the well-being of others.
* Acts of kindness and service can foster a sense of community and reduce self-centered tendencies.

Remember, personal development is an ongoing process. By incorporating these principles into your daily life, you can build a balanced and virtuous approach to living that aligns with both Stoicism and humility, fostering positive relationships and a healthy sense of self.

"Thank you Epictetus, it's only a cup","My morning routine is to come downstairs, make a pot of coffee, maybe a slice of toast, and then take my coffee up to my office to write before the day formally begins. We also walk around our house barefoot. I brew my coffee in a french press and keep it in one of those ceramic canister with a snap lid. We had just purchased new beans and they were still in the can they came in. The canister lid is very heavy, so when I open it and it is empty, it wants to fall over. I filled my grinder with beans and as I lifted up the can of coffee beans to load my coffee bean storage canister, it decided to tumble of the counter and disassemble itself.

And my only thought was ""Can I reach the broom without having to step on the broken ceramics?""

I could.

The canister was empty, I lost no coffee beans. Had it been full, I have to admit I may have had a different reaction. But for now it just something to sweep up and warn my wife about potential hazards in the kitchen.

"""Focus on what you can control"" - are we using it wrong? Studying Epictetus made me think so...","It was a year ot two after the peak of COVID. Major tech companies were so extatic with the explosion of online presence, due to the pandemic, that they recruited new employees in unprecedented numbers.

The CEOs were excited, HR folks were busier than ever, and engineers were a commodity. 

But the world had other ideas... 

It turns out people became more active online, as a temporary escape from the reality of quarantine and global pandemic. Put simply - the tech companies too a bet, a bad one.

The growth spree was too much for them to handle. Expenses on salaries exploded, while income decreased due to folks going back to real-life activities and spending less time online.

So, the tsunami of layoffs washed over the world of tech companies...

Every second manager I met, tried supporting their teams by reminding them to ""focus on what you can control"". Focus, they explained, on actions you have more authority and power over.

Do I eat eggs or toast for breakfast? do I go for a run or stay in bed? 

All around me, people used ""focus on what you can control"", like some kind of magic pill. But it didn't work so well. Many people started just ignoring this cliche piece of advice, while others vocalized how nebulous it is for them.

I have been studying Epictetus' discourses for months now - going throug every line, writing notes as I go, sometimes dreaming about what I've read that day. 

I am beginning to realize ""focus on what you can control' is not at all about focusing on small or mundane choices that can *feel* more under our control.

It's *not* about focusing on the choice between eggs and toast...

Because these are still externals, just more accessible externals, compared to being layed off or not. But externals nonetheless. 

What if you choose eggs and you ran out of eggs? Or you have to skip breakfast because you have to help with the kids? 

You still aimed your will at something external...

Epictetus keeps repeating that we need to focus only on internals, only on our own internal condition.

We need to focus on *how* we do things,  not *what*.

Eggs or toast - it doesn't really matter, focus on going through breakfast with equanimity and confidence.

Layed off or not - you can't really control that, focus on being rational, stable, less emotionally reactive.

This is what I am trying to practice these days...

My kids will sometimes do their own thing sometimes directly opposite of what I asked. My wife will sometimes prefer than and not the other. My team members will sometimes not meet my expectations. I have not control of these. Nor should I seek it!

Rather, I am trying to focus on how I act and react. Keep my internal state free to get excited and then quickly relax back to steady state.

Let the waves of emotions come and go quickly, without drowning in them. Focus on how I go though life, not what I'm going through.

Reflections on happiness,"Re-evaluate where you find your happiness. Find your peace. Keep it. 

Beware, and take care not to search for this gladness within externals. 

For if they depart, so too does your happiness… out of your control. 

Instead, you can find joy within your reasoned choice, which is up to you. 

Be courageous, then! Find happiness in your acts which improve mankind. 

Sure, you will have wants, but when they are pulled away, don’t complain or cry. 

Happiness is not having what you want. It is wanting what you have. 

And what do we have? The ability to choose appreciation over desire. Generosity over jealousy. Courage and grace over cowardice and contempt.",Stoicism,1700491592.0,t3_17zq46c,0.96,23
Questions about Stoicism,"1. Stoicism asserts that virtue is good and vice is bad, which I agree with. However, doing what is good isn't objectively morally right, for in order for it to be objectively right you would need a reason why doing good is right more than just mere opinion. Stoicism is thus a subjective philosophy. Doing it because it aligns with your nature, also doesn't make it morally right because you would need to prove why doing what aligns with your nature is morally right. Thus, the philosophy is subjective. In other words its just your opinion that doing what aligns with nature is what is right. What reason then, do I have to follow it?
2. How do Stoics rationally defend against Utilitarianism, for example? If we assume doing what is good is what is what is right, wouldn't a philosophy such as Utilitarianism be more good and thus more right?",Stoicism,1700514979.0,t3_17zz8dg,0.75,6
I've been fighting a childhood addiction and failing miserably,"this is rather embarrassing, so please bear with me. thank you for choosing to read this.

since my childhood, I've been keen to listening to music and daydreaming. i am 19 right now and I am still doing this to excessive levels to this day. it has reached to a point where i now have the urge to listen to music when I feel provoked, which is why I consider it an addiction on my part, since i have been doing it for years now and have difficulty stopping my urges. i have an important exam that i need to study next year and I'm taking a gap year, yet i waste so much precious time just indulging myself in this. i remember back then when my months once felt like days at the beginning of this year, because i had some other problems and dived into my addiction more. i don't want it to happen next year again.

i have tried to stop it, at least 20 tries. and yet i fail each time, just going back to it after at least a few days. my longest win was when I threw away my earphones. i lasted for a couple of weeks and bought a new one again.

i have been reading about stoicism since this summer, and feel as if it really could help me overcome this. yet i do not know how to overcome the fear of failing miserably again. I've been a coward my entire life, being afraid of measly things, and i want to stop it; and if i stop this, i will take a really big step forward, and i will be better at being a stoic.

the popular videos and advices on the internet appear insincere and I feel i cannot relate to them, therefore I've come to look for people who have dealt with similar problems, or have overcome addictions with how the Stoicism changed their perspectives. if you have any sort of advices you could give me, or wisdom you would love to share, i will gladly listen to you.

thank you for reading. have a nice day.

EDIT:

i have edited this post. after seeing the FAQ as well, asking for a direct advice as to solve addictions ""solely"" was a mistake. a philosophy should not be used solely to solve one single problem. this was not what I was trying to achieve, so let me rephrase myself.

i have been trying to apply stoicism in my life. i really have, especially after looking after a sick bedridden grandmother for over a year. hard times push you to change some of the rewirings in your thinking.

so please see this OP not as one that asks their problem to be solved, but perhaps one that looks for encouragement to overcome their fear of failure, or rather one that needs a stoic perspective to enlighten the situation better. people who have had similar problems are very welcome to share their situations with me as well. i just need coaching, i suppose.

Distractions in the form of hope,"Just wanted to share an everyday insightful experience.

I was sitting in my kitchen, admiring the different patters of our tiles on the wall. You’d think I should’ve noticed them by now. Instead, I was never present enough to appreciate the hard work put into the arrangement and overall look of the tiles. Awareness is very hard to come by these days. I experienced this sensation after a life threatening 4km run today. Pushed my limits to the point where I was happy to be alive. I started smiling as my eyes teared up from the realization that finally.. I can see what’s in front of me. Beautifully arranged tiles. 

Suddenly the all too familiar sound of Instagram notifications caught my attention.  Immediately I was transported in the doomed state of ignorance. Hoping it was a message from a girl I like. Setting myself up for a slight disappointment. I was even angry to see that the message is from a colleague, like it’s his fault for giving me false hope. 

Turn those distractions off and take a sneak peak of the world filled with beautiful tiles, just waiting to be noticed.",Stoicism,1700482544.0,t3_17zn7zy,0.76,6
Discourses Epictetus Chapter explanations,"Hello all!

Been reading discourses and trying to consume and understand everything Epictetus is trying to instill with his lectures. The text and translations are a bit dense and hard to read at times but I am trying my best. I stumbled upon a blog that summaries each chapter: [https://www.rockyrook.com/2018/03/epictetus-discourses-book-1-chapter-2.html](https://www.rockyrook.com/2018/03/epictetus-discourses-book-1-chapter-2.html)

Musonius Rufus' First Step in Training the Soul,"> For by these things and others like them the body is strengthened and becomes capable of enduring hardship, sturdy and ready for any task; the soul too is strengthened since it is trained for courage by patience under hardship and for self-control by abstinence from pleasures. **Training which is peculiar to the soul consists first of all in seeing that the proofs pertaining to apparent goods as not being real goods are always ready at hand and likewise those pertaining to apparent evils as not being real evils, and in learning to recognize the things which are truly good and in becoming accustomed to distinguish them from what are not truly good.** In the next place it consists of practice in not avoiding any of the things which only seem evil, and in not pursuing any of the things which only seem good; in shunning by every means those which are truly evil and in pursuing by every means those which are truly good. (my emphasis) https://sites.google.com/site/thestoiclife/the_teachers/musonius-rufus/lectures/06?authuser=0

I think Rufus gives us two standard examples of this in his first lecture in the series: 

> Take for example the proposition that pleasure is not a good. At first sight we do not recognize it as true, since in fact pleasure appeals to us as a good. But starting from the generally accepted premise that every good is desirable and adding to it a second equally accepted that some pleasures are not desirable, we succeed in proving that pleasure is not a good: that is we prove the unknown or unrecognized by means of the known or recognized. Or again, that toil is not an evil is not on the face of it a persuasive proposition, while its opposite, that toil is an evil, seems much more persuasive. But starting from the known and accepted premise that every evil is a thing to be avoided, and adding to it another obvious one, namely that many forms of toil are not in the category of things to be avoided, we conclude that toil is not an evil. 

Regarding talk of real goods and apparent evils, this, which I have by no means spent much time with, comes to mind: 

> There be two things that do assault this castle of constancy in us, false goods, and false evils: I define them both to be such things as are not in us but about us: and which properly do not help nor hurt the inner man, that is, the mind. Wherefore I may not call those things good or evil simply in subject and in definition: but I confess they are such in opinion, and by the judgment of the common people. In the first rank [false goods] I place riches, honor, authority, health, long life. In the second [false evils], poverty, infamy, lack of promotion, sickness, death. And to comprehend all in one word, whatsoever else is accidental and happens outwardly.

> From these two roots do spring four principal affections which do greatly disquiet the life of man: desire and joy, fear and sorrow. The first two have respect to some supposed or imagined good, the two latter unto [some supposed or imagined] evil. All of them do hurt and distemper the mind, and without timely prevention do bring it out of all order, yet not each of them in like sort [way]. For whereas the quietness and constancy of the mind rests, as it were, in an even balance, these affections do hinder this upright poise and evenness; some of them by puffing up the mind, others by pressing it down too much. (found on an unsecured site, so here is [another link instead](https://archive.org/details/twobooksofconsta00lips/page/14/mode/2up). 

Rufus' proofs appear to (implicitly) take the form of *modus tollens*: If toil is an evil, then it is to be avoided. But it is not the case that toil is to be avoided. Therefore, it is not the case that toil is an evil. I think it's really interesting how central Rufus makes logic to ethical practice. Personally, keeping these (and others, for the argument form is readily adaptable) proofs handy has been incredibly helpful. If you have incorporated this form or other argument forms into your practice, please share:)",Stoicism,1700448930.0,t3_17zejx4,0.9,26
"Whats the stoic way of dealing with a love interest/Crush that one is not destined for,Or right person at the wrong time?","So basically theres this girl whom I have a massive crush on and got a lot in common but unfortunately i found out that shes in a 4 year serious relationship.And Since I found that out its been hurting like hell to the point I feel it has interferred in my day to day activities where sometimes I dont feel like eating or getting out of bed which ultimately results in my health declining obviously.
Would the ruling of letting go of things we cant control apply to this situation?Naturally as a young man I feel jealousy and Envy even though I know its wrong..
It sucks cause the guy shes with is a great man,I have no shame admitting hes a better man than me,He has his life and priorities sorted out,Hes excellent with his family and deals with them diplomatically and just an outgoing social person,pretty much a good guy where as me Its the opposite in terms of having my stuff sorted out and priorities..
I know its wrong but I get thoughts of hoping and wishing that they break up even though there pretty much married tbh not officially but close...But i know thats wrong cause I will wait my whole life wishing for something that will never happen.

Or should I be straightforward and go and ask her out or at least tell her and risk it?Ive had crushed before but not like this were I know were compatible
It sucks cause If our time was right,Had i just met her before tbh.....I know ill never get her but im this dilemma where it hurts..
How should I approach this in a stoic manner where I can try to move on or carry on my day to day activities..Any advice is greatly appreciated and Dont worry be honest as possible..

My biggest life mistake was wanting to live an easy life,"2023 summons this the best, I didn’t want to exercise, diet, barely studied, barely did anything useful, expected my friend to do all the work for me, procrastinated a lot by saying that “tomorrow I start to do this”, got addicted to porn, tried to be a people pleaser (even going against some of my own believes), etc 

I regressed a lot as a person and what  were my rewards for wanting to live an easy life basically in autopilot with no logic and following just pure emotions ? Anxiety, memory issues, suicidal thoughts, weight gain, burnout, a lot of extra final exams that almost cost me a full semester, almost lost some of my friendships, i got way behind my peers and didn’t get my driver’s license 

Growing up I was never pushed/expected to do great things, if I was average that was enough for my parents and me, my mom basically did my homework for me, I would eat and watch tv all day and not leave the apartment and no one would care, so I never developed discipline, sense of urgency and maturity 

I have my ups and downs but basically to this day I lack those core elements and the 4 stoic principles 

With no temperance no self discipline nor control so I will waste my days with pleasurable things and just “do the important things tomorrow”, even tho nothing guarantees me a tomorrow

With no wisdom no intelligence and resourcefulness making me have bad grades at my college and be afraid to treat patients (I’m learning to be a dentist but I don’t reread core concepts such as anesthesia so I just ask my friend to do all the work for me at the clinic)

With no courage no scape from my comfort zone so I don’t try to improve myself 

With no justice I abandon my principles of wanting to be a good man and focus only on pleasing people and not strengthening or even developing a sense of character 

I hope that this serves me as an experience of what living a shallow existence is and how to always try to be better than yourself from yesterday (even if it takes baby steps)",Stoicism,1705691126.0,t3_19aqv6w,0.95,28
How does one stop being so emotional?,"
Hello,

A few months ago, I stumbled upon stoicism, and I've been thoroughly enjoying immersing myself in its teachings and practicing to become a true stoic, striving to be the best version of myself. However, I find that I'm facing a challenge in effectively harnessing my emotions. I comprehend that the teachings emphasize the practice of refraining from expressing unnecessary emotions, but I'm particularly struggling with becoming less emotional, especially in my interactions with other people. How can one navigate the path to emotional restraint and cultivate a more stoic approach, particularly in interpersonal relationships?

Even though I have researched and tried to apply my findings of stoicism, I feel that the one thing I still struggle to control is my emotional decision-making.

It’s easy to say to yourself “stop being emotional,” but I find it’s counterintuitive, especially if you encounter situations that will strike an intense emotion.

Does stoicism care anything about how simplistic or grand your goals are?,"I've been thinking a lot about meaning lately, and I guess I'm in somewhat of a crisis. 

I know a lot of people in the world might say that if you want meaning or purpose in your life you need a respectable goal. Which, on the surface, I can understand. 

My concern is that...what does it mean if you can't? What if you fail? We're all prone to do so. What if other obligations come along and you have to give up your dreams? What if you become disabled? What if you straight up die the very day you decide on a goal? 

I'm not saying that if someone is dreaming of being an astronaut they should just give up. But should our goals be where we find meaning and contentment?

Today I will begin a path of gratitude,"4 years ago, coming out of high school. I experienced mental struggles that changed myself and the way I view life. For over a year, I struggled with severe depression and anxiety. While it did get a bit better, these mental issues underlied my time in college. They were related to regret, guilt, and insecurity.

4 years later in the present. I'm honestly in a position I never thought I'd be in. I've gained a lot of personal confidence, lost social anxiety, have a great girlfriend, and will be starting a job after college making more money than I could ever imagine.

But still, lately I've found myself more low than normal. Starting to spiral down into some of my old thoughts. Which are triggered by specific things that I won't get into. These past years, I don't think i've ever truly felt peaceful and free, at best I could push my thoughts away and try to ignore them. 

4 years of overthinking, dark thoughts, self-doubt, anxiety, closing myself off to others. What did I gain from that? Nothing at all. Just lost time.

Today I will try to being a path of gratitude and perspective. I cannot base my happiness on my current situation. I need to appreciate everyday as it is, not regretting the past or worrying about the future. I need to focus my energy into the things I can improve on and control, my work, the gym, building friendships, my relationships etc.

"What would be the Stoic approach to dating and finding love? Is it even worth me, as a man, trying my hand at dating?","Long story short: I’m 28 years old and have never been on a date, and thus never been in a relationship. I’ve never known love outside of that given by my parents. And I also never had friends growing up and thus spent the majority of my life alone. That was until recently when I finally managed to acquire two genuine friends. 

To put it simply, I’m lonely. I feel an emptiness inside me that no amount of Lexapro (antidepressant medication) can seem to fix. I want the feeling of waking up next to someone I love and feeling genuinely happy. But I also know how hard it is for men in our day and age to find romance/love and how dating apps can be like bottomless pits of swiping over and over again, just hoping and praying one girl out of 100 will match with you. But even then, there’s a good chance she’ll ghost you just because. It all seems so hopeless. 

But, I also know the Stoics would say things like “Your happiness should not be dependent on the people in your life and the value you place on them”. And I just don’t know how to reconcile the Stoic philosophy and finding true inner peace and tranquility with my desires I want out of life and not wanting to be lonely anymore.",Stoicism,1705586183.0,t3_199qp1t,0.88,46

I need a stoic solution on how to deal with an issue in my relationship.,"Hi, my (F30) husband (M32) have different levels of affection whereby I am more affectionate and love spending quality time, hugs, kisses, asking about his day etc whereas this doesn't seem to occur to him naturally. Therefore I always feel deprived of affection and acknowledgement very often. It's as simple as not being acknowledged when I walk into the house after a workday, barely even looks in my direction and I have to initiate a Hi let alone a kiss. When I initiate he does respond but this is wearing on me since it would be nice to have that without asking for it. I have expressed this multiple times but he changes for awhile and goes back to old patterns soon after. I'm beginning to grow resentful especially because this last week and part of this week I have really struggled mentally and would have loved a genuine ""How was your day today?"". I would also love hearing ""I love you"" without having to say it first. So I decided to mirror his behaviour and not Initiate any of my usual affection and conversation, we've been quiet for 2 days. I wonder if I should focus on controlling my own actions as recommended by stoicism and maybe seek the affection elsewhere? Or maybe not give affection either so that I don't feel short changed and hence protect my peace of mind. His family is the same way, naturally dull and cold and have an almost professional relationship unlike mine that is very much affectionate hence my personality. I really cannot continue to pour from an empty cup. He is a lovely guy otherwise, and I love our life together. Help me.",Stoicism,1705582274.0,t3_199pgm8,0.77,11

"Today I got rejected at the gym, and it felt so good 😊","I consistently see this one particular girl at the gym, she’s nice looking, and several times over a few weeks we make eye contact, and so, naturally, I’m like, okay, she “MIGHT” be into me, maybe, somewhat?

So today, the gym closed at 5 and she happened to be parked next to me, and so, I put my gym stuff in the trunk of my car and before I head to the drivers side, I take a small breath, and I literally say in my head, “stoicism baby, whatever happens it’s cool, not a big deal”
So I go to her, small tap her car and she rolls down her window, I continued to say that I see her often here at the gym, and that I think she’s really pretty, finally I say if she’s seeing someone. She says she is but she is very flattered that I even came and did this.
I said “oh hey no worries! what a lucky man he must be! Well! I won’t take too much of your time, thank you!”
Finally she asked me what my name is and I said my name, and she said hers, and then it was farewell after that.

In the end I was completely satisfied with being rejected because it’s a step forward, and I’m glad I did this 😊

My father committed suicide today.,"11/16/2019

Today, my father committed suicide by firing a gunshot into his head while parked behind a church in his work vehicle. 

He left a 10 page suicide note full of love for his family and friends, a blood splatter on the front page, a claim that he was a victim to big pharma in the middle of the note, and a list of what he found to be his inadequacies on the very back of the notebook. 

He viewed himself as ugly things in that moment. He made that clear by labeling himself “ugly, unhealthy, alone”, and more. He wasn’t any of the things he listed. His perspective was warped and he reached a hell no one could help him escape.

He had been struggling with a deep depression for the past few months, but had fostered an amount of poor habits for as long as I remember. Amongst them were poor diet and leisure choices and subscription to negative ideologies relating to currents events, politics, and people. He had recently attempted to switch his medication in hopes he could eventually not rely on any anti-depressants. I had also tried to give him a psychedelic mushroom experience a few weeks ago, but he experienced no effects at all. He was desperate for a way out of depression. He was willing to try any medical regiment, pill, or operation, but he didn’t seem to be able to gather the strength necessary to make lifestyle changes. Prior to this bout of depression, and for as long as I can remember, he had struggled with a very painful gut condition that remained undiagnosed by dozen’s of medical professionals. They couldn’t find anything wrong with him, but he never didn’t feel pain in his stomach. 

My dad had a poor relationship with his father, who had a poor relationship with his father. My grandfather didn’t seem to open up for emotional discourse, and that passed onto my dad. My grandfather didn’t seem to love my sweet grandmother, who had MS. My dad also had a brother who died of cancer before I was born. I think this is the event that caused the creation of many of his bad habits, as I’m told his brother was his best friend and that they did everything together. My dad took care of my grandmother when my grandfather died, and provided her his own home and a caregiver while he lived with her, but struggled to treat her with decency. He would often berate her when she had an accident or was in his way as he was walking about the house. 

All of that being said, that is not an accurate way to view my father. All people have struggles, demons, and shortcomings.

He was viewed by his friends and family as larger-than-life, uplifting, and a source of endless humor. He had more friends than anyone else I can think of. Random groups of people gathered around him when he was at the gym to listen to his jokes. (I have subconsciously told many of his jokes throughout the course of my life, but never gave him credit for his humor. The truth is, he was actually pretty damn funny.) His girlfriend told him that he gave her the best years of her life, and he reciprocated that sentiment to her. He always praised me for how smart he thought I was and how confident and proud he was in me. He worked hard, almost to a fault. He made the city’s he worked for safer and held up his end of society’s bargain. He gave his friends what many of them gave him: a helping hand at a moment’s notice. 

Up until today, I was never impressed with my father. I didn’t see the deeper causations of his shortcomings. I thought he over-ate, over-sexualized, possessed ideologies, succumbed to lethargy, and failed to emotional express himself, all as a result of his own choice. This isn’t true. My dad was never equipped by the people around him to handle the burden he was facing, which was primarily caused by not being equipped for any possible emotional burden. 

Today, I am extremely impressed and proud of my father. I saw the family he created from 3 separate families gather and love each other for him. I saw the emotional impact his friendship had on his friends. I realized that he did the very best he could with what he was given. He handled his circumstance as well as anyone could have. 

I was rough on dad during this depression. I realize I was. I told him there was no shortcuts. I told him there was no going back to his old life, because his old life of seemingly “happiness” but still the cultivation of poor habits was the reason he was depressed. I told him even if he could go back, I would reject it, because I didn’t want him to be that way. I read to him from a few books. I got him in to see my therapist, but I don’t think he returned for a second visit. I meditated with him once. I made him a meal to show him he could do it on his own. I gave him a specific book to follow along with as the audio book played in his headphones. He only read, to my knowledge, 3 chapters before his death. I believe if he would have finished it, he would not have done this. My father didn’t know how to take care of himself within his own head, and no one provided him with the tools necessary to be able to learn how to do that. No matter what I or anyone said to him, he wasn’t able to see the light at the end of the tunnel. This frustrated me. It shouldn’t have. I get it now. 

I told him the truth. I told him a pill didn’t cause this and wouldn’t fix it. I knew medication surely wasn’t helping, but I knew his anti-depressant dependency was a symptom, not the cause, of his depression. I told him the only way out was to create routines that would be miserable, hard work, for weeks before they would begin to reveal themselves as good. 

I accept my responsibility in his death although people tell me I shouldn’t. They all should too. If I wanted to help him more in the moment, I would have. I did not. I neglected him when I should have been with him. I didn’t call him many days. I isolated myself from him for months earlier in the year, which could have single-handedly created this increased depressive state. If I had considered he was capable of suicide, my approach would be kinder and more vulnerable. I do believe I could have kept him alive. This is my burden and I will not be changing my mind for the foreseeable future.

It is hard to picture my father pulling a trigger on himself. It is hard to picture my father immensely hating himself in his final moments. It is hard to know he considered himself a burden to his loved ones during his depression. He was not a burden. It was difficult. It hurt. It was stressful. We selfishly made it about us on accident. But he wasn’t a burden. This is a burden. 

I didn’t know much about my dad because he was very emotionally closed off. My goal is to learn more about him for the rest of my life so I can understand why everyone hailed him as a hero while he was alive, instead of how I only see that now that he is gone. 

It’s painfully obvious now he was a lovely man. He was an absolute stud. He had a special smile. He had a community that was magnetically constructed from his personality built around him. He gave me everything I needed to be successful and is the sole reason I am equipped to handle the tragedy. He was pure selflessness incarnate to the ones he loved. He was moral and knew the difference from right and wrong. He was a man of leisure, outdoorsmanship, and sportsmanship.

He is somewhere now where he is calm and his anxieties no longer plague him. He is where he is most comfortable. He will make that clear to his loved ones in due time. 

I share this with the stoicism Reddit out of respect for the users and what we try our best to practice. I know I can't change this event. My goal now is to improve and set the ultimate example for others to keep them out of this hell. Thank you for listening.

When the end comes the most surprising thing is how nothing changes,"So a little context before i start: im going to pass away this week, probably not more than a few days away now.

&#x200B;

My reason for posting here is asking for some advice, maybe some help with reflection on how to remain stoic in a situation like this, or perhaps just someone to wave me off. Im having what can only be described as an incredibly vast mess of emotions raging within me, competing for dominance, anything from fear to sadness, happiness and excitement, and of course confusion. But the one im struggling the most with is how nothing seems to have changed around me. That life moves forwards for everyone else while i seemingly stand still is such a surreal feeling which makes this so unreal. I wake up like any other day, but with the knowledge that its soon over. That im not going to catch the next episode of that TV show, how im not going to read that new novel, or try that new game with my friends.

Fear because im afraid of what comes after, if anything at all. That there could be nothing, is just as scary as what could be. Sadness because i have had to distance myself from friends, also a factor in leading me to post here anonymously. Happiness because i wont need to worry about the physical pain and further deteriorating body, that i dont need to question whether or not i have eaten in the past few days. Excitement because of what could be, maybe there is a vast world that i get to explore without being ill. and confusion because all of these emotions exist and act out simultaneously.

I opted for not being in the hospital, and instead in the relative comfort of my own home. Im feeling very conflicted as i clean what i can, tidy, throw away things, and generally prepare myself for maybe not waking up the next day. The recurring theme is that none of this feels real to me yet, I expected things to be different, for the world to say something back to me. But all im met with is the little comfort normality brings, although I am feeling disappointed and confused that nothing is different around me.

If youve gotten this far, thank you for reading this. That someone is even taking the time to read this means a lot to me, because it makes me feel a just a little bit better, because maybe someone would be able to understand just a little bit of what im feeling through this text.


EDIT: To everyone that is reading and commenting, i try to reply to as many as i can, but know that you are already doing more than i could have hoped for from a stranger. All of the comments in this post bring me an amazing sense of calm i could never have imagined I'd get. So many people engaging with me makes me feel a sense of calm in the storm i didn't think was possible, you guys are all giving me the feeling that it's going to be ok. That it's just the next step. That you all have given me the thing i treasure the most right now, your time and attention, so to everyone reading and commenting, thank you.

"Good Stoic advice, courtesy of Worf",,Stoicism,1607624207.0,t3_kaknsl,0.99,2615
Observations by a dying stoic,"Some things I've contemplated over the past week or so.  

1) I’m glad I came to Stoicism before I got the terminal diagnosis. I see a lot of people looking into Stoicism for a coping strategy when faced with big issues or problems. For me that would come too late, I think. In my case I’ve spent a good deal of time already contemplating my death and my place in the universe. Accepting the diagnosis on a personal level was easier than it might have been otherwise. 

2) The main struggle for me was with how to tell my family. I was concerned about how they would take it and was waffling about should share it I right now or should I wait a bit. Many of you advised sooner rather than later. I took that advice and have told my wife and family and friends near and far. The response has been humbling. As has often been quoted, ""We often suffer more in our imagination than in reality.""  I have not told my boss or coworkers at this point. My reason for that is that I think it would be distracting right now when there is nothing for them to do one way or the other. 

3) I have not asked my Doctor for a time frame. Not because I don’t want to face it, but because I don’t believe it’s helpful. Those are just statistics and they don’t dictate the outcome. I’m focused on the right things and my affairs will be in order in the next couple of weeks. Whether I have 3 months or 1 year or can achieve complete remission won’t change how I plan to live my life day to day.

No one cares about your life,"I know the title is a bit pessimistic, but hear me out.

We're the center of our world. Since we were born, literally our entire existence is seen from our own viewpoint. Thats why we think we're so important. people have social anxiety, because they think everyone is paying attention to them. These days, people do so much things to impress others, to be accepted, comparing themselves to others.

But at the end of the day, its a tough lesson to learn that really, no one cares. Yes, you have friends and family who truly care about your life. But for the most part, no one is even remotely as invested in your life as you are yourself. You see someone on the street wearing super expensive clothes, or a homeless guy. Are you thinking about them when you go to sleep? do you worry about their future? probably not even close to the way you think about your own life.

so really no one cares. we are not special. billions have come before us, and billions will come after us. You could spend the rest of your life in depression, or being the happiest guy on the planet, either way the world will keep spinning, everyone else will keep living their own lives. So what was the point of this post? Of course, one of the biggest stoicism principles is understanding whats in your control and whats not. We gotta back ourselves up. we gotta live our lives for what we want, stop worrying so much about others, what they think, what they do, where they are. At the end of the day all we truly have is ourselves. We gotta be there for ourselves in the lowest times and the most difficult trials.",Stoicism,1598067074.0,t3_iebel4,0.98,2593

"Everyone is going through a tragedy. They don't stop coming, they come more frequently. Life doesnt get better, but we do.","2019 was a tough year and I became very self absorbed. I lost 3 friends including my best to drugs, suicide, and more suicide in a very short span of time. I lost another friend to murder. Another best friend was sleeping with another best friends wife. Destroyed the group.

 We've all been the tightest friends since highschool for over a decade, I felt like my whole world was ripped apart piece by piece.  All I wanted was for it to stop and for things to just get better. It doesnt. Grandpa has cancer throughout his entire body.  Mom lost her job and needs surgery (Thank god we live in canada). I broke up with a woman I probably should have married, but instead blamed her for some of my unhappiness and I hurt her. A lot.

Just to top things off I was also working 16 hour days at 3 jobs, while studying for my real estate license, while coaching wrestling as a volunteer, while volunteering at the hospital on fridays. I never took a single day off, except the morning one of my friends died, my boss told me to go home from training because I was distracted. I failed my 3rd real estate exam the week my best friend died, cost over $1000 to retake. At my other jobs I would cry in the bathroom and blame the time spent on constipation. 3/4 of my finances were lost in the stock market that I did not keep up with. I gained weight and became very antisocial and self absorbed.

To be honest there were mornings I would be driving the work truck and be contemplating suicide. But I told myself I just needed to ride it out, things would get better.

But it took me even longer to realise that I'm strong enough to bare the burdens of life. And that I needed to be more responsible. And that's what is most important.

Things get better when you have time to think about them. I quit the jobs i hated, I'm a full time realtor now, I've had a lot more time to think. I fell in love again, and felt rejection for the first time.

 But wow what an awesome part of life, to be able to love so much is a blessing even if they don't feel the same way and turns out they only wanted you for one thing (bit of salt there still). I spend every day I can with my grandparents, whom I knew I took for granted. I LOVE my new job as a realtor, I love my athletes that I coach, I love when the patients at the hospital tell me how much they appreciate me, and knowing that I can do something for them and not getting anything in return. No one but my parents and my ex girlfriends know I volunteer. I love every minute of my life.

I want to share this journal entry with anyone reading that life doesnt get any better, but we do, and when we do our best, it makes life better for everyone. I'm a genuinely happy person again. People are much more attracted to me again. I'm able to give so much more again. My closest friends ask how I'm able to give away so much of myself, with how much money and time I spend on others. My cup is over flowing, happiness doesnt come from your savings account. It might be different for everyone, but from this stoic, it comes from how much I can give.

Thanks for reading to the bottom, I hope your 2020 is the best you've been yet.

*edit*

I really appreciate my first reddit Gold and I really appreciate that my little journal entry had an affect on people in a positive way. Thanks everyone. I want to add that although I appreciate it, and i dont want to sound ungrateful, but money is better spent on doing something to help ease someone elses tragedies!

I keep imagining my wife alone in the house, my kids losing their dad, my parents losing a son, etc.  I know those are externals but I need some help getting there.

I am spending my time making sure my affairs are in order to reduce the burden on them after I am gone. So that is one benefit of the slow roll instead of being taken out by a bus, but the overwhelming part is how this will hit them.  

Could use some help orienting to this. I am at peace with my own demise, but maybe not? because I am struggling with how others will be impacted.  I know that is their path to walk, but I'm stoic, not uncaring.

UPDATE: I told my wife last night, over the phone. (Out of town helping my Dad while my Mom's in the hospital.) Man, you never know the grace and strength of those who love you until it's tested.

Holy fuck stop using stoicism to become an emotionless punching bag and take action to solve problems,"Holy fuck the amount of ppl not understanding stoicism wastes their youth.

Stoicism isn't a pill you take to not feel pain.

It's not something you use as an excuse to NOT handle your problems. 

The goal isnt to become a fucking souless and heartless uncaring person unable to feel emotion.

Guys turn to stoicism since not feeling is a masculine legacy, but men take action to solve problems and become stronger and get better providing, protecting, etc.

""Oh I got yelled at/I'm broke/family member died so I should be resilient bc I can't change it so I shouldnt care"" is a common and  fucked up interpretation of stoicism.

Yes, you can't revive the dead, but you can solve the root problems, trauma making you grieve.

Go talk back to the person who yelled at you
Go get skills and get paid more
Go to therapy and deal with trauma



The goal is not just to be selective and solve the problems you can solve, but to understand the root of your problem and solve that.

Cool you're not tall enough? No use crying about being short? No....The problem is you feel unconfident. So get things that would make you confident in other ways e.g. more money, better clothes, better communication skills,

If you get punched or emotionally berated and use stoicism as a masculine mask to cope, it means you're not dealing with it. It's going to keep happening. And you're not a punching bag.

Yif you don't solve the problem influencing your feelings and life at it's source, you'll keep getting hurt and coping sounds like you can't change... That it's ok to continue to keep being hurt.



If I'm sad or want to be stoic while I'm broke, fuck that. Do something about that.

Stoicism isn't about rolling with the punches. It's about taking action on what you should and can take action on.

Fuck. 

If you got some shit to do, post it below and do it.
Take action, and don't be a souless punching bag unwilling to stop the punches.",Stoicism,1666204453.0,t3_y8ag4r,0.92,2257
Potentially my last message,"**Potentially my last message**

I'm writing this, knowing that I will soon be dead and forgotten. 

A couple of people might think of me for years after my death, but eventually these will die too, and nobody will remember that I ever existed.  

Reddit might still be a thing in 1000 years, and this post might still exist by then. However, it will not remain like that forever. At some point in the future, even the internet will cease to exist. 

Humans will cease to exist, the universe will cease to exist. 

Every track of me will be erased. Nobody will be able to tell that I ever lived. It will be like I didn't even live in the first place.  

**You're not missing out** 

A couple of years ago, I would have a panic attack reading this. 

I believed I was gonna change the world.

I wanted to make my mark on the world so badly - so that I could be remembered forever.  

Now I'm strangely okay with this.

Why? 

Because I have realized that nothing lasts forever. The only constant in this world is change. 

Since nothing else lasts forever, I am not missing out on anything. In fact, everyone else will eventually suffer the same fate as me. 

If everyone suffers the same fate, our fate can neither be good, nor bad.  

It's just the way it is.   

**Valar Morghulis**

I'm sure you have seen those creepy gravestones: 

* Remember stranger, as you pass by,

* As you are now, so once was I.

* As I am now you soon will be,

* Prepare yourself for eternity. (to follow me.)  

These are surprisingly accurate.

We must all die. We must all be forgotten. We must all follow each other into eternity. 

Valar Morghulis. Memento Mori. 

We are in this together. 

**Our destination is the same**

Life is like a giant maze. 

We can take so many different paths. 

We think that one path is better than the other. 

But we don't realize that all of the paths end up in the same place.        

Once we realize that our destination is the same, we can escape the maze. We can escape our ego. 

We become chill. We cease to worry. Problems are no longer problems. 

**So what now?**

Once we realize that the maze is a joke, we also go through an existential crisis.

Sure, we might not have any problems anymore, but we also don't have any goals. 

What should we do with our lives then? Why even live? 

I'd reverse the question and ask: Why not? 

If you can live entirely without problems, what is so bad about living? Why would you want to end it? 

Sure, there are things you dislike here in life. But you only dislike these things because you still believe in the maze. You believe that you must take a specific path. Once you realize that the maze is an illusion, and that all paths end up in the same place, you become indifferent about the path you are taking. 

1 billion dollars in debt? Severely handicapped from an accident? Chronic health issues? Wife left you? Living on the streets? Nobody cares about you?

That's one path. It's as good as any other path. Ultimately, they all end up in the same place. 

**Life is like Minecraft**

I'd equate life to playing Minecraft. There is no specific goal. You can't win. You can't lose. But you'll still keep playing. Why? Because playing isn't so bad, and you have no incentive to quit. You'll make up some kind of goal for yourself. 

Personally, I've made it my goal to make some of the other players suffer less. Have fewer problems. 

That's my path. I know it's as good as any path, but I still choose it, cause I need to move my character somewhere. I'm already playing the game. I have zero reason to quit it. 

Maybe the path will be difficult, maybe it will turn narrow. Maybe I will have to abandon it. Maybe I will have to take a different path. I won't be disappointed about that. I know where I'm gonna end up.   

**Take your lunch now and attend to death later**

As Epictetus said: 

*I have to die. If it is now, well then I die now; if later, then now I will take my lunch* 

Do the same as Epictetus. 

Take your lunch and eat it, while being in a state of complete equanimity. 

Realize that there is nothing negative about death. 

You don't have to suffer, while eating.

"As the President of the USA reports testing positive for COVID-19, a reminder that it is wrong to take pleasure in another’s pain","This is the passion called epicaricacy, and it is unreasonable because it reaches beyond what is one’s own and falsely claims the pain of another as a good.

When wisdom tells you what to do then do it without complaining, because complaining just gives way to suffering. If you do find yourself complaining then it might be time to reevaluate your judgements and beliefs. 

I have brain damage and life can be overwhelming. Things that were once second nature now take enormous amounts of energy. It is easy for me to become discouraged on days when I have to retrain myself, as a parent would a toddler, but it is even more difficult when I give into complaining.

"I can’t control this sub’s inclination to pickup artistry, but I can warn its subscribers...","All, 

Several years ago, I stumbled into stoicism and found it resonated with me. No doubt, having the emotional strength to accept which you cannot change and the courage to change that which you can, can improve your life in many aspects, and dating is certainly one of them. 

However, I have seen a number of posts that hyperfixate on the link between pickup artistry and stoicism. I think, as many of you do here, that you almost have to be a stoic to try and implement any pickup artistry strategies, but oh my god you guys, when did this subreddit turn into r/seddit? 

I see a lot of young men here getting into stoicism and falsely believing that the problem with their dating life or the reason they’re still single is because of their emotional response to rejection when they act in unattractive ways. Earlier today, a young man posted about how he tried to cold open a woman by tapping on her window like a highway cop after following her out of the gym, and literally 150 of you guys were like “great job king”, which [edit] is consistent with a pattern of young men misapplying stoicism to “cold open” flirting approaches 

Enough- part of being a stoic is acknowledging and being humbled in the face of knowing that you may, unfortunately, be a maladjusted, socially inept individually who requires serious, serious therapy and rehabbing of ones social skills in tandem with stoicism. It would be very disappointing if many of you were misled to believe that your failures in life were exacerbated not by your lack of maturity or knowledge, but solely by your emotional responses to failure. 

That is, *if you were drawn to stoicism because you felt bad about something bad in your life, and believe that simply thinking away your bad emotional response to that problem will automatically make it go away* is batshit insane. 


Back to this young gentleman who cold opened a woman in a parking lot- clearly, this poor kid was unaware that his conduct would be interpreted by most reasonable people as predatory and a gross violation of social norms. Yes, using stoicism to dial your emotions back in unsuccessful dating flirting situations is good, but Jesus Herbert Christ, do not think that Qui-Gon Jinning your way through life without the tools to actually succeed (mainly, a baseline set of social skills) is going to bring you happiness. 


Moral of the story- if you were drawn to stoicism because you struggle with social anxiety, dating troubles or professional conduct, you must first examine the underlying problems with your conduct and what needs fixing, *then* ask whether your emotions are getting in the way of implementing that solution. Do not use stoicism as a crutch for your bad behavior.

Stoicism can and should be practiced in tandem with feminism.

Second edit: 

If you think that approaching a woman while she is in her car, doors closed, windows down, after she has left the gym, and tapping on her window so you can tell her she is pretty and ask her if she is single, after being prompted to do so because, even though you had no prior conversations with this woman, you had a feeling that she may be interested in you after a series of eye-contact exchanges and nothing else, is *not* an unreasonable reason, place, time and manner to approach a woman you’re interested in, and isn’t a violation of reasonable social norms, and *wouldn’t* cause most women to feel uncomfortable, this post is not for you, as it means we fundamentally disagree on what is a healthy and well adjusted way to conduct oneself in public and will probably not see eye to eye.

Third edit: 

To clarify the point to be made here: You cannot violate reasonable social norms, suffer anxiety about being rejected or ostracized for violating those boundaries, and then expect to overcome said anxiety by curbing your emotional response through stoicism. If I shower once a week and experience ostracization for it, I should not use stoicism to get over my fear of rejection for being stinky. I should just take a shower more frequently. Part of growth and maturity is accepting that some social norms are *good*, some conformity is *good* and respecting them is part of being a normal, happy, well adjusted adult, while some norms should be challenged because they perpetuate injustice. 

If you lack basic social skills, such as being able to distinguish situations in which it would or would not be appropriate to compliment a woman and ask her is she is single, you will probably experience some ostracization. Using stoicism to curb your fear of that rejection will not work, because you haven’t addressed the underlying problem thats leading to rejection in the first place - grossly violating social norms. Re: parking lot guy, if you can’t understand the problem with his behavior, you probably share some of the underlying problems that that OP has, too, and this post isn’t for you.

Fourth edit: for some of you that can’t understand why parking lot OP’s conduct violated social norms, consider the following analogy. Have you ever taken an Uber or a Lyft really early in the morning? Like 20 minutes after you’ve woken up and before you got coffee? And the driver immediately starts asking you where you’re going and why and you just want to scream “asshole, one, it’s none of your business, two it’s 6:15 in the morning and I’m not here to chat so can it!” except the reason the Uber driver is talking to you is because they want to fuck you instead of because they’re bored or lonely or anxious for 5 stars, and you can’t really ignore them because if you do they might get offended and pull the car over and kick the shit out of you, so you give them half-assed one word answers while staring out the window to appease them in the hopes they leave it alone, then you’re on the right track to understanding why *that* OP is violating social norms, and if you still don’t get it, this post is DEFINITELY NOT FOR YOU.

"""In everything that you do, pause and ask yourself if death is a dreadful thing because it deprives you of this."" - Marcus Aurelius","Since this subreddit has seen a burst in activity, I thought it would be nice to greet newcomers with and explain to them, my favourite quote of all time.

Yes, the quote without context is macabre. But when you look at it the way (I only assume) it was intended, it is quite the most uplifting sentiment there is.

Life is a string of events, most of them greatly inconsequential, a great many of them uncomfortable or indifferent, and a select few, fulfilling.

As is clear from this breakdown, one could do away without the majority of life and it would remain more or less the same in the end. 

But the quote concerns itself with what *you* do, not what is done unto you by others or by nature.

What are you doing right now? Are you doing something with no end in sight, just going through the motions? Will you be proud of it when you die, if you are blessed with a moment to look back upon your life?

Or are you doing something fulfilling, that you may be a better person thanks to it? Are you reading when you ought to be reading, pursuing your hobbies, taking care of your family?

Are you jacking off, binge-watching the most pointless string of videos, taking one too many rest days, delaying whatever it is that you know needs doing?

It's easy to divide these between ""this will give me a prouder death"" and ""this will make me rue the fact that I could have used a little more of my time when I still had it, but wasted it.""

Despite nuance, despite complexity, at the end of the day you know which box your next move falls in. Take accountability for your own life, don't live life from the passenger's seat.

"Whenever you find yourself upset, pay close attention to what false appearance/expectation you had that led to the discomfort. This is how you grow as a Stoic.","Stoics believe that every distress that we encounter, however minor or major, is caused by a poor expectation or assumption that we made. To become unconquerable, then, is to forsake the perceptions that society teaches you, to not assume that a person will act in such a way, and to not make any expectations about what the future holds. This is how Socrates openly welcomed a death sentence. This is how Epictetus dealt with being enslaved and crippled with such equanimity. This is how a Stoic becomes invincible. 

Upset that you broke your leg? Did you expect your leg to be unbreakable? Why are you so convinced that a broken leg is a bad thing? 

Angry that you lost your job? Why did you assume that it was in your power to keep it? You do not control the economy, the industry you work in, or your boss, so why did you think you controlled whether or not you stayed employed there?

Sad that a loved one died? Who told you that they would live forever? How could you not see it coming? For everyone and everything dies eventually. 

I should add that it is okay, and natural to *feel* things when things happen. What I am talking about here is you ruminating, dwelling, wallowing, and otherwise playing the ""woe is me"" card for days on end. ***Feeling*** **an emotion is a natural, momentary, human response that is more or less inevitable.** ***Thinking*** **an emotion is an intentional choice, and oftentimes an unnecessary reaction to something after the initial feeling has subsided.**

**Tl;dr**: False perceptions and assumptions of control over things you do not will necessarily lead to disappointment and distress. The faster you can assimilate reality instead of thinking you can change it, the happier you will be.",Stoicism,1603450129.0,t3_jgkt6i,0.99,1960
7 principles to a peaceful life,"During the last lock-down, I had a lot of time to think about life. I came to the conclusion with 7 principles that I follow every time I find myself miserable. Later, when I was writing a seminar paper on stoicism, I connected most of the principles to stoicism. I thought sharing them with you.

1. Know what is and what is not in your control. Do not control what is not in your control
2. Be and do what you want others to be and do. Do not expect them to be and do what you want them to be and do.
3. Do not judge others. They have their own reasons. They live their own life.
4. Do not respond to others judging you. As long as you are not purposefully hurting them, it is them and not you, do not let it become you.
5. Without your reaction, everything is powerless.
6. Try to look at all the sides. Do not worship, but if you do, look at it from all perspectives.
7. Life is not a problem to be solved but a reality to be experienced. You do not know shit, you will never know shit, just dance and enjoy the show, love and care and love and care will come.

Hope it will help anyone. Peace, love, WATN",Stoicism,1606210955.0,t3_k0227l,0.99,1958
"""Captain your own ship but do not attempt to command the sea.""","Excerpt from William Ferraiolo's Meditations On Self Discipline and Failure: 

""Detach yourself emotionally and psychologically from the news of the day. Do not ignore it. Do not attempt to pretend it away, or imagine brighter possibilities than the available evidence can support. An escapist delusion is not a solution to any problem, and it is no proper part of any plan to address future contingencies. You must pay attention, but you must not allow your peace of mind to depend upon events magically conforming to your wishful thinking or your stubbornly held expectations. In fact, hope is always misplaced when it is vested in the vicissitudes of the political, social, or economic spheres. Your hopes are to be attached only to your own efforts of will, and your own diligent attention to self-discipline. You must hope that you have the fortitude to meet the challenges that you encounter. Captain your own ship, and chart a course toward wisdom and virtue. Do not, however, insist upon commanding the sea.""",Stoicism,1581883946.0,t3_f4we63,0.99,1951

Just like you and me. We are all in the exact same boat with one universal fate for all of us. That got me thinking of how many great people have died since we have known time. Warriors, scholars ,poets, artists, scientists, mathematicians, athletes ect.

My mum passed away,"My mum was rushed to hospital Friday night and passed away on Saturday. I managed to get there at midnight on Friday after contacting the hospital and they informed me that she'd suffered a very serious brain hemmorhhage.

Mum was unconscious and needed life support. The doctor told me that I should get any family to come by immediately as her condition could deteriorate at any moment. I have two little sisters (13 and 14) and mum is our only parent. The doctor told me that bringing them was a personal choice as seeing our mum like that would be quite traumatic.

I called close family and had them come down along with my sisters. They stayed til 6am then went home for some rest. The doctor performed a pain stimulus test on mum at 9am. I thought she was fairly responsive (limbs jerking) but the doctor took me aside and said that mum had suffered a catastrophic bleed and that there was no consciousness left.

As next of kin I was responsible for calling family and friends to bring them down as quickly as possible. Mum's condition worsened twice but was stabilised each time. Everyone had an opportunity to say their goodbyes before close family and I had a second meeting where the staff repeated the chat we'd had.

We supported mums organ donation (found out yesterday that the recipients of her heart and kidneys are progressing well). We ended up leaving at 6pm after the second doctor performed a pain stimulus test to confirm their decision.

The reality of becoming a new guardian to my sisters, mum's death and being responsible for all the decisions as next of kin have been overwhelming.

Seneca, Moral Letters to Lucilius, [Letter 1](https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_1)

>The mind that is untroubled and tranquil has the power to roam into all the parts of its life; but the minds of the engrossed, just as if weighted by a yoke, cannot turn and look behind. And so their life vanishes into an abyss; and as it does no good, no matter how much water you pour into a vessel, if there is no bottom to receive and hold it, so with time—it makes no difference how much is given; if there is nothing for it to settle upon, it passes out through the chinks and holes of the mind. Present time is very brief, so brief, indeed, that to some there seems to be none; for it is always in motion, it ever flows and hurries on; it ceases to be before it has come...

Seneca, On the Shortness of Life, [Chapter X](https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/On_the_shortness_of_life/Chapter_X)

>But those who forget the past, neglect the present, and fear for the future have a life that is very brief and troubled; when they have reached the end of it, the poor wretches perceive too late that for such a long while they have been busied in doing nothing.  [...] All postponement of something they hope for seems long to them. Yet the time which they enjoy is short and swift, and it is made much shorter by their own fault; for they flee from one pleasure to another and cannot remain fixed in one desire. Their days are not long to them, but hateful; yet, on the other hand, how scanty seem the nights which they spend in the arms of a harlot or in wine! [...] They lose the day in expectation of the night, and the night in fear of the dawn.

Seneca, On the Shortness of Life, [Chapter XVI](https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/On_the_shortness_of_life/Chapter_XVI)

>And why is it that even their joys are uneasy from fear? Because they do not rest on stable causes, but are perturbed as groundlessly as they are born. [...] For everything that comes to us from chance is unstable, and the higher it rises, the more liable it is to fall. Moreover, what is doomed to perish brings pleasure to no one; very wretched, therefore, and not merely short, must the life of those be who work hard to gain what they must work harder to keep. By great toil they attain what they wish, and with anxiety hold what they have attained; meanwhile they take no account of time that will never more return.

Seneca, On the Shortness of Life, [Chapter XVII](https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/On_the_shortness_of_life/Chapter_XVII)

So what's the solution? How does one live life without squandering it? 

Use your time wisely; that is, rise to the demands of your circumstances while keeping your will in accordance with nature and humanity. View events (past, present, and future) and the role they define for you with acceptance, even embrace them with gratitude, and you won't be troubled either by things that have happened, things that are happening, or things that are yet to be. 

That's the payoff: you'll *own* the hours you've lived, and you'll have confidence that you'll own the hours that are yet to be. 

When your happiness is generated by making virtuous decisions rather than deceiving yourself into thinking you own or control people and things, when your satisfaction depends on exercising your will, keeping it in harmony, and honestly owning your choices, then the past, present, and future are all places you can visit with comfort and confidence.

>The life of the philosopher, therefore, has wide range, and he is not confined by the same bounds that shut others in. He alone is freed from the limitations of the human race; all ages serve him as if a god. Has some time passed by? This he embraces by recollection. Is time present? This he uses. Is it still to come? This he anticipates. He makes his life long by combining all times into one.

I stepped out of the car, immediately checked on the guys in front of me, asking them if they were hurt (thankfully no one was). They were just about to start cursing but my question and composure startled them, and they simply followed my guidance in trying to contain the situation.

I informed them to call the authorities, while I go to check on the driver behind me - still in her car. She was in a state of shock, crying. I asked her if she's hurt, and when I verified that she wasn't, calmed her down as best I could. These things happen, no one is hurt, c'est la vie.

Finally I guided everyone to the side of the road for safety. The authorities came and we filed out the paperwork. Everyone was by this point relatively calm, and I felt a sense of respect from all parties. An unfortunate situation all round, yet I think an experience which all the affected parties learnt from, and which put my Stoic virtues to the test. I dare say I'm proud of myself!

"Buddhism and Stoicism both strive for tranquility and inner peace, yet approach it from different handles in rhetoric. Buddhism by what is not in our control (Dukkha, Samsara). Stoicism by what is (Virtue, Reason).","**Personal background:** For the longest time I've been a pessimist. Ever since around the age of sixteen, when, in a desperate search to answer why to the anxieties of my life and the shitty things the people around me were going through, I over-read everything from neuroscience that proved human free will false (Libbet experiments, unconscious biases, genetic factors in personality, etc) to hobbesian like studies into violent human nature in history and evolutionary psychology to post modernism, Nietzsche, and pessimists like Schopenhauer and Cioran and Ligotti to recent studies on catastrophic climate change. I've been in a state of deep negativity and hopelessness and fatalism, declaring life not only bleak but actively malignant for it's asymmetry in pain and pleasure (anti-natalism, Benatar), even actively praising and contemplating suicide. and sometimes testing myself.

**One of the subjects I over-read was Buddhism**, thinking it would help me from all the self-help industry around it, and yet I found it's bleak archives on it's analysis of Dukkha to contribute to my nihilism.

For if it's analysis of Samsara (the cycle of suffering driven by aversion, clinging, and misperception)  and Dukkha (how all conditional phenomenon/impermanent things are unreliable for happiness and dependence) was correct, and yet, thanks to modern science, where we know that there is no supernatural phenomenon, and so there is no rebirth nor nirvana, why not then kill ourselves if the ultimate goal of such a religion, as it seemed to me, was renunciation of the material world?

Oh sure there was compassion in staying back and helping others break free from the cycle of rebirth, but then the goal was still the same, rejection of being here (I understand Mahayana had a change in perception with it's Samsara is Nirvana and Bodhisattva ideal, however it's compassion was ringed with supernatural salvationism and faith in order for it to become the Greater Vehicle, almost like Catholicism idolatry vs Christ's asceticism) .

Furthermore, the Buddha himself was often portrayed as a superhuman figure, and yet he did some odd things like: [Encouraging a man to abandon his family](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/ud/ud.1.08.than.html), [telling his followers to treat food like eating a child's flesh](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.063.than.html), and [accidentally convincing a group of monks to kill themselves](https://www.wisdomlib.org/buddhism/book/vinaya-pitaka-1-bhikkhu-vibhanga/d/doc227270.html). He also only allowed women in later into his order, with far more rules and deference to their male colleagues. He wasn't perfect, yet the religious trappings around his renunciation oriented teachings didn't help. It fueled my pessimism. I didn't fully understand.

**Recently however,** through self reflection due to personal guilt, I was finally starting to break free from my negative thought cycles, and Stoicism was like a lightening bolt that finally pushed me through, all starting with Enchiridion's beautiful opening statement:

*There are things which are within our power, and there are things which are beyond our power. Within our power are opinion, aim, desire, aversion, and, in one word, whatever affairs are our own. Beyond our power are body, property, reputation, office, and, in one word, whatever are not properly our own affairs.*

This gave me the jolt to finally understand it wasn't the circumstances that condemned us, but our character. I had to take self responsibility.

**This was basically what Buddhism was saying this whole time.**

The side of Buddhism I neglected to explore during my nihilism was it's focus on Karmic responsibility. It's redefinition, in it's Hindu context, of Good and Bad not being caste, actions, or birth, but intentions and character (The Upanishads, with their similar sentiments, were also being expanded upon in this similar time-frame).

This was true even with the no-self doctrine, which could either be a technique for realizing what's not in your control (not-self: this is not me, this is not I, this is not mine, to all impermanent phenomenon including internal changes like states of consciousness or thoughts) or realizing there is no true self/eternal self (ala Hinduism), but an impermanent, multi-faceted (dependent arising, when this, that. When up, down, etc), process (no-self).

It said this same truth of the dichotomy of control from a different, more grimy angle:

*Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of suffering: birth is suffering, aging is suffering, illness is suffering, death is suffering;* ***union with what is displeasing is suffering; separation from what is pleasing is suffering; not to get what one wants is suffering***; in brief, the [*five aggregates*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skandha) *subject to clinging are suffering.*

*Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the origin of suffering: it is this* ***craving*** *\[*[*taṇhā*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta%E1%B9%87h%C4%81)*, ""thirst""\] which* [*leads to re-becoming*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Nid%C4%81nas)*, accompanied by delight and lust,* ***seeking delight here and there***; that is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for becoming, craving for disbecoming.

*Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering: it is the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving, the giving up and relinquishing of it, freedom from it,* ***non-reliance on it.***

*Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering: it is this noble eightfold path; that is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.*[*\[web 9\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Noble_Truths#cite_note-BB-71)

Essentially, going back to Stoicism's core statement, Stoicism reinforces and focuses on what's in our control (Virtue), while Buddhism focuses on what's not in our control and letting go (Dukkha/Externals). Both, of course, talk about both parts of the statement, but have a more extensive focus on one side or the other. Both encourage and lead to ethical character and sage like/arahant like inner peace, but both grasp it from a different angle (and have different metaphysical aesthetics/technical details, of course).

**And, so, in summary:**

If you are miserably drunk on life (caught up in the chasing of and running from externals and narratives of hope and desire and fear), study Buddhism, it will tear it all up and bring you down into the grimy real.

If you are miserably sober on life (pessimistic, fatalistic, fearful, depressed, think nothing is within your control and life already sucks and not worth the effort) then study Stoicism, it'll give you the kick in the ass you need to see that you do still have power, the power to improve and take responsibility, that your dignity comes from within, not without.",Stoicism,1587559381.0,t3_g60ff9,0.98,1570

Came to a hilarious stoic realization this morning,"Every night I write my to do list for the next day.

 It usually starts with : Wake at X time, etc, etc. It makes me more productive. 

The past few days I've been a bit sick, and I'm making sure to rest a lot and I have a lot of extra time since I'm self quarantining, can't train, etc. So, I'm waking up whenever I want to.  

So I write down : Wake Whenever .

I love checking things off of my to do list, and, it's become a habit. I check off, wake at 6am to go run, because, well, it's a hard thing to do. It makes me happy when I am able to check off something like that.
So, by habit, I checked off, ""wake whenever"" today, then stopped and said, well, that's not an achievement isn't it? My mood darkened a bit. But then I lightened up! But, I did wake up right? Im not dead. I made it through this night! I have an extra day! Wow!

"The point is not to control your emotions, but to not let your emotions control you.","The problem is when it comes to negative emotions people tend to try to control them. Perhaps act like they aren't there or trying to push them away. But this is counter productive. There is a noticeable difference between controlling something or not letting it control you.

(Insert hypothetical situation here). But for something relatable say you are mad about something that just happened, for instance, you didn't get the job you applied for. You feel mad, but don't want to, understandable. At this point you have a choice. 
1. You give into your feelings and just be mad, but since we're on r/stoicism that won't cut it.
2. You try to control your emotions by telling yourself; 'Hey I'm not mad, I just think I'm mad but I'm really not so I just won't be mad about it.
3. You accept that your mad, you feel that your mad, but know that this madness doesn't mean your whole day or week or life is ruined.

Now the big difference is that when you try to control your emotions you will eventually live in some kind of denial. You will still feel mad but just put a smile on while you are still feeling mad inside. It is still controlling you. The trick is to see the feeling you're having not as something that dictates the way you behave. You can be mad and just go about your day. You can still cook dinner while you're mad. You can still apply for a new job while you're mad. 

When you start to feel your emotions are not controlling you, you will become much more stable and free. When you try to control your emotions you will eventually be controlled by them. Putting a smile on while you're sad or angry still means you are being controlled by your emotions.",Stoicism,1617710057.0,t3_ml9vwt,0.99,1534

*Natural but unnecessary pleasures include sex, having children, or being held in high esteem by others. These aren’t needed for happiness, and we should avoid pursuing these too much to avoid suffering and not overcomplicate things.*

*And to dispel the myth of the Epicureans as self-indulgent hedonists: There are unnatural and unnecessary pleasures, which are difficult to attain and include the usual vices of alcohol and excessive sexual pleasures. Epicureanism teaches that we should always avoid these. Epicurus warned, regarding these last two categories, “He who is not satisfied with a little, is satisfied with nothing.”*

"""We are to the universe as bacteria are to us."" How reminding ourselves of our smallness can help us deal with hardships","A few days ago I was walking through a heath when I stumbled upon a foresty patch. Those aren't rare in the heath near my home, there are lots of trees and small pieces of forest scattered throughout the bushland, but this patch of trees was different. Most trees in the heath are wide with low branches; oaks and alders. These trees were different. I'm not an expert on trees or anything, but I'm quite certain those were some type of fir. Tall with a barren bottom, the first branches appeared meters above me. 

I looked up, and the trees continued to go up and up, most likely continuing past the canopy I couldn't possibly see through. I felt small. I felt insignificant. I felt as if I was but a speck in the universe. These trees stood there before I was born, and will continue to stand there long after my death. There's nothing I could possibly do to the trees. I could run into them at full force and they would not even notice. 

I looked down, and below me, I saw a long caravan of ants. They walked in a long line, carrying food, cut in parts so small I couldn't identify what it used to be. None of these ants were alive three months ago and none will be alive three months from now. I probably stepped on a few of them while walking here, and I did not care. 

Then it struck me. I am to the trees as the ants are to me, and I am to the ants what the trees are to me. As above, so below. We are all ants.

And do I believe an ant's feelings are important? Imagine an ant saying ""I am sad because my head has the wrong shape. I am sad because I am 5% smaller than the other ants. I am sad because another ant I know got stepped on.""

We would say that that's ridiculous. I mean, it's an ant. Why would an ant care about being uglier or smaller or poorer than the other ants? Its life is short and insignificant.

Now, whenever I encounter hardships, I try to see it from a bird's eye view. I try to zoom out, I imagine seeing myself from the sky. In the grand scheme of things, I am just as insignificant as an ant, and there is no reason to believe me being sad or angry matters. I try to live life with as much happiness as I can, but I do not believe struggle or pain is necessarily bad, because it is only temporary.",Stoicism,1611665297.0,t3_l5dbiy,0.99,1498

My pet recently ran away because of a careless roommate leaving the gate open. It’s been two days and he hasn’t turned up. I’ve lost hope, I’m devastated, depressed, can’t get up or go to bed.

Turning 21 tomorrow and I just want to leave you all with something that really inspired me last night.,"I was watching Rewind last night, It is a documentary that came out this year about a young boy who was sexually abused by 3 different men from when he was between the age of 4-7 years old.

There is a sobering moment in the movie towards the end where the boy must testify against his uncle who is a powerful religious man in New York City, who has high paying lawyers trying their very best to tear down the credibility of this boy. 

The boy's psychiatrist was in tears telling the story of how the boy testified in court about his abuser and how bravely he fought in the face of injustice.

And after a lengthy trial due to an unlimited supply of charitable donations to his abuser, the boy decided to take the abuser's plea deal which in turn resulted in 0 time being served in prison.

Now bear with me because this is the part I want to get at.

&#x200B;

The boy who is now 30,  is talking to the psychiatrist about the trial which had been years ago, and he says something along the lines of ""why are you so proud of that moment, we lost? 

The psychiatrist said, ""Because I have never seen someone handle a situation like that, where lawyers were cross-examining you, and trying to tear away at your spirit, and your bravery being able to recount in painstaking detail what had occurred to you over those years shined so bright.""

&#x200B;

I am 21 tomorrow, I may not win the battles in my way and I certainly have not won all the battles in my past, but I will make sure my ethics and principles will shine through like the light of that brave boy through every waking moment of my life.

 1.

Is it for this that I am fashioned, to lie in bedclothes and keep myself warm?' 'But this is more pleasant.' 'Were you born then to please yourself; in fact for feeling, not for action? Can't you see the plants, the birds, the ants, the spiders, the bees each doing his own work, helping for their part to adjust a world? And then you refuse to do a man's office and don't make haste to do what is according to your own nature.'

"""Love is giving someone the power to destroy you, and trusting them not to use it.""","**edit:** Swap the word ""destroy"" with ""hurt"". It seems a lot of you read the quote and didn't read my breakdown. Loving someone, or extending your desire towards something outside your control, risks disappointment. Especially if you have yet to get your internals right and establish a good solid Stoic foundation. Read [Enchiridion 2](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0557,002:2:2). That doesn't mean we don't love things, it means we should be cautious doing so. To those of you who did read the whole thing, you brought up some fantastic counterpoints, and I appreciate you :) This was just some musings at work, I didn't sit on it as much as I should before posting. Definitely didn't expect this to explode as much as it did.

*I have no idea where this quote is from. I've seen it attributed to Johnny Depp, John Lennon, and even Spongebob. If someone knows where it's from, lmk and I'll update it.*

I saw this quote as a kid and it always stuck with me. As I grew older and I realized that my mother had raised me as a Stoic without knowing what that was, I realized that was the reason the quote resonated with me so well. Since I posted [my story](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/e4fh6e/my_two_year_journey_so_far/) here about a year ago and have since been open about my situation with people asking for help, several of you have reached out and we've had absolutely fantastic discussions about how love meshes with Stoicism. I thought I'd kinda compile it into a post and share with the rest of the sub.

**Love is an external, like anything else.** Thus the above quote can be altered to ""\[Loving something\] is giving \[it\] the power to destroy you, and \[hoping it doesn't\]."" Epictetus says that if you choose to care about something that is outside our control, you are making yourself a slave to the one who does control it ^(Enchiridion 1 and 14). When you love something as a Stoic, you need to accept that it is temporary, flawed, and ultimately out of your control. The time to have this conversation with yourself is now; mentally prepare yourself for losing what it is that you love. Run through the simulations in your head. Have a contingency plan. **Not because losing them is inevitable, but simply because it is possible**. Otherwise you are giving a part of yourself to someone for them to roll the dice with. And ""If a person gave your body to any stranger he met on his way, you would certainly be angry. And do you feel no shame in handing over your own mind to be confused and mystified by anyone who happens to \[hurt\] you?""^(Enchiridion 28)

**This does not mean don't love or chase externals, just like Stoicism in general doesn't mean don't care about the future**. By all means, strive for your best life and live it to the fullest. Just know that in choosing to do so, you need to likewise choose to be cognizant of the inherent risk and prepare yourself for the possibility that it will bite you in the ass. Everything is a choice, and nothing is gained for nothing.

"""You should listen to your emotions, but not necessarily agree with them""","I thought about this earlier while mediating. The way I see it, you should treat your emotions like a close observer whose judgment is of great benefit, but at the end of the day, you should also be in control of your own decisions. For example, say you are afraid. It is a good thing that you've been warned of that fear and you should accept it and pay attention to it. But maybe your reasoning determines that you should act anyway, because sometimes you have to act, even with fear. Other times, you decide that your fear is justified and that avoiding the situation in place is of greater benefit.

**Wisdom**: understand the world without prejudice, logically and calmly

**Courage**: facing daily challenges and struggles with no complaints

**Justice**: treating others fairly even when they have done wrong

**Temperance**: which is voluntary self-restraint or moderation – where an individual refrains from doing something by sheer will power

Girlfriend of 2 years confessed & broke up with me,"My girlfriend of 2 years whom I shared many great memories with came out to me as lesbian and broke up with me a week ago. 

We broke up over the phone and it goes without saying - it was tough. 

I've dabbled with stoicism and stoic principles in the past and conveniently, only recently picked it back up; It's as if the universe was preparing me for this very moment.

I was confused and devastated.

""I don't know how else to say this but, I like women.""

 Every part of my being wanted to break down and feel hopeless. Then suddenly, I had a eureka moment amidst the storm in which I reminded myself of the wonderful philosophy known as stoicism. 

""That's okay."" I replied

""Thank you for giving me the opportunity to love you, I hope you live a good life.""

Within seconds I reminded myself that this would eventually happen and that there is nothing I can do within my control that will change the present situation, Instead I can save my dignity and act out of principle and not emotion. 

It's been a week now and I am at peace. I remind myself everyday that anything in life such as relationships, depressive periods and good days are ephemeral and we should never attach to anything.

My girlfriend is a Stoic person and today she told me something which left me dumbstruck.,"I'm a pretty emotional person. And since I'm dealing with some mental illnesses too my emotions tend to be quite intense. Often I react in a disproportionate way compared to the situation. Or I might not react at the appropriate time. I'm emotionally unstable but I'm also very, like, very unsure of myself. I don't believe a word that I say and I hate myself. When people are socially dominant around me and are telling things as they are I panic. I get defensive. And when I'm engaging in a debate with my girlfriend probably 80 percent of the time I end up  whimpering about how she should stop *‘thinking she's right all the time.’* Our intellectual  discussions would devolve into me lecturing her about her tone of voice. Arguments over who is wrong and who is right would end abruptly as I will suddenly declare that the truth of the matter is forever hidden somewhere inside a murky *“grey area,”* and therefore the entire conversation has been a pointless waste of time.

I know I'm a toxic person but she has so much patience with me and today she explained me in a calm and tender manner why she is so dominant and confident in a debate or in any social situation appealing to her Stoic philosophy.

"""Anger makes you do stupid things faster and with more energy.""","""Anger blinds us and makes us stupider by undermining our ability to think clearly and make rational decisions about complex social problems.""

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8b6-8EGdiw) is a 14 minute talk on anger by Donald Robertson. (Quotes are from the video, and just one aspect of anger that he talks about.) An excellent talk, IMHO.

I am convinced that anger is almost never of any benefit. And those few times when there might be something beneficial from anger, there are always alternatives that offer even better benefits. I still occasionally get angry and when I do I try my best to find something that can justify my anger. I'll let you know if I ever find such a thing.

Robertson says Marcus Aurelius mentions 10 different ways to deal with anger. Robertson points out the more popular technique of reminding ourselves that **it is not things that upset us but our opinions about those things**. This is my main go to mantra when I feel that shot of adrenalin being released in my blood stream - warm face, increased heart beat, deeper breathes. I also remind myself that it is not a saber tooth tiger about to kill and eat me but instead, for example, it is just someone who said I was wrong about something.

My car was repossessed and I’m ok.,"Today as I pulled into my house after getting off work for the last day of an 8 day stretch, a tow truck was next to my house, when I pulled in I turned the car off as he pulled in behind me. There was two cars in my drive way that are part of my wife’s old bonding business, and when I asked the man which one he wanted, he replied, “the one you’re in my man.” After the initial momentary confusion wore off, it was like something clicked in my brain. “Things happen, control only what is inside of your control.” That thought kept coming into my mind, and I handed him my keys and asked how much time I had to get all of my things out of the car. He seemed shocked at how calm I was and said, “as much time as you need brother, sorry to have to meet you this way, my job is really shitty I know.” My wife was crying and yelling about what we were going to do, and I told her that we have the means to make it, and that no challenge presented today is insurmountable. She calmed down in short order, and we are now calmly discussing our plan to get over this small hump.I wanted to tell you guys about this because I’m a lurker on this sub and I’m so proud of you guys when you have a great stoic moment.

I Completed 60 Days of Meditation for 1 Hour/day and it cut my Anxiety away. I'm Now Making an App.," I recently completed Naval Ravikant's recommended 60 days of meditation for 1 hour per day. I tried meditating before this for around 20/30 mins but never really felt that much benefit. So I started doing 1 hr. I tweeted about each day which kept me accountable and committed each day.

At first it was very difficult to sit still for that long. But after the first week, I started to truly realise that all of my problems were in my own head. I was perceiving things poorly, from past images that I'd clung onto.

Reading wisdom from the main 3 stoic philosophers, Jiddu Krishnamurti and Naval Ravikant each day also helped to rewire my mind, giving me useful stuff to meditate on. I now realise that living in the past causes depression and living in the future causes anxiety. Discovering for myself that this is true makes me almost unconsciously stay present - and I feel much better for it.

I am currently learning to code and as a practice project I'm making a meditation app that I plan on using myself. It's going to be based on doing 60 days of meditation, 1 hr/day. At the beginning, only day 1 is unlocked. After meditating for a full hour, the next day is unlocked. Each day has some advice/quotes from the philosophers I mentioned before.

I made this post on the meditation forum and had a surprising amount of interest so thought I'd ask if anybody on here would be interested in using this, I'm thinking of putting it on the app store? :)",Stoicism,1596275297.0,t3_i1por3,0.95,1295
Stoic exercises that have turned my life around,"# Introduction

A couple of weeks ago, I wrote [a lengthy article](https://projectimpero.com/2019/11/08/stoic-manual/) on **seven of the most effective exercises** that I have taken from the Stoics, with a few ideas on how to implement them. It's no secret that Stoic ethics can be surprisingly pragmatic, so I thought it would be good to capitalize on them. For the sake of brevity and convenience, let me sum up **three** of them right below:

# 1 - Premeditatio Malorum

If you're in this subreddit, chances are you already know about this one. It's probably the most famous of all. For that reason, I won't dive deep into its theory here.

In a nutshell, though, the exercise consists in **willingly anticipating scenarios of misfortune**. Research shows that our brains have a hard time differentiating between real-life experiences and imagined ones, so it's no wonder that this practice works so well (I theorize that it has a similar function than nightmares do in terms of evolution). This ""premeditated pessimism"" is useful for three main reasons:

* a) It helps you **plan in advance** (any good strategist knows to take the worst-case scenarios seriously)
* b) It increases **mental toughness** (by softening the emotional toll things will take on you)
* c) It will make you **happier** (by stopping your constant hedonic adaptation)

We can go about implementing the practice of Premeditatio Malorum in two main ways:

The first is what I would call **""short bursts"" of premeditation**. This is a more shallow approach that values frequency of practice over intensity. For instance, as the typical example goes, a husband could consider that the kiss he gives to his wife every morning before leaving to the office could be the last. He is not supposed to sit with the thought and actually dive into it, but just to simply contemplate for a second that this is a possibility — **because it is**. Not only will this make the kiss be more genuine and deliberate, it will also make sure he finds a deeper joy in seeing his wife again later that day — something which he usually takes for granted. In this case, even if the very worst happened (i.e. his wife did pass away unexpectedly)  he could at least find some comfort in knowing that **he made the best out of the time they had together**, and he will be less crushed by the unexpectedness of it all.

The second method is analogous to a **meditation session**. Contrary to the first, this one values intensity over frequency. Rather than randomly coming up with reminders throughout the day, it consists in willingly setting some time aside every week to face one particular fear that troubles your mind. In the article, I give the example of how I dealt with a periodic anxiety I had about the possible death of my father. In summary, I dealt with it by willingly facing the worst-case scenario, in total detail, for about 30 minutes one day. I went into my room, turned off the lights and looked at that creeping fear right in the eyes. To my surprise, as the tears started to flow, I realized that my anxiety was simply an unhealthy sublimation of a deep-rooted love, care and respect for my father. By **willingly switching the script** and visualizing my nightmare, I went from its victim to its adversary and, eventually, to its friend.

# 2 - Mourning Pages

(Nope, that's not a typo, it's spelled with a ""u"" for a reason)

If there is one philosophy that takes not complaining seriously, it's Stoicism. Marcus Aurelius wrote:

>*“Everything that happens is either endurable or not. If it’s endurable, then endure it. Stop complaining. If it’s unendurable… then stop complaining. Your destruction will mean its end as well.”*  
>  
>Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

In other words, if you can endure it, **stop complaining**. If you can’t endure it, **stop complaining**. It’s that simple.

Exercising your ability to stop complaining can be quite tricky, but the exercise of Mourning Pages has worked wonderfully for me. It's not explicitly Stoic (it was invented by a modern writer) but it's undeniably Stoic. Let me explain.

Every morning, you are supposed to sit down for a few minutes every morning and **unload the petty, whiny, constant chatter of your mind onto a page** — without thinking too much. You simply grab pen and paper and write whatever is on your mind. It doesn’t have to be artsy; it doesn’t have to be well-written; it doesn’t even have to make sense. In fact, the less artsy, well-written and structured it is — **the better**.

The benefits of the exercise are threefold. First, it will **quieten your mind**. Julia Cameron (who invented the exercise) explains that it’s as though you had vacuumed the corners of your consciousness with a dust buster. This newfound mental silence will, in turn, allow you to **become more creative** (that’s the reason why she came up with the exercise in the first place). Finally, it will also allow you to become acquainted with the **dark parts of your psyche**.

This, it seems to be, is somewhat similar to what Marcus Aurelius himself was doing. As professor Michael Sugrue put it in his famous lecture, Marcus would have probably been ashamed if he had known that we read his personal journal. After all, it was his main way to vent: to tell himself that he is going to meet incompetent people, to remind himself to keep his cool, to let his whiny inner-voice get some time to unload itself.

Implementing this exercise is quite straightforward:

Every morning after waking up, instead of grabbing a trendy *Gratefulness Journal* or reciting *affirmations*, you are going to grab your **Petty Journal**. Then, your only goal will be to pour 2 to 3 pages of thoughtless writing onto the page. It’s important that you **do not think too much**, for that will cut the stream of cloudy consciousness that we are trying to run dry.

What’s beautiful about doing this practice in the morning is that it will empty your *“complaining quota”* for the rest of the day. Once you reach those 2 to 3 pages of writing and close your diary, **it’s over**. You’ve already whined, you’ve already been annoying on paper. You’ve probably said things you don’t actually mean — and that’s perfectly fine. This exercise is so powerful that its author described that they should be called Mourning Pages, with a ""u"", because:

>*“\[Mourning Pages\] are really a farewell to life as you knew it; and an introduction to life as it’s going to be.”*  
>  
>Julia B. Cameron

# 3 - Practicing Poverty

Similarly to the first exercise, this one is quite famous. I don't think many people realize *how* famous it is, though. The practice of poverty has been around for ages, and even modern individuals like Elon Musk have put it to work. The man willingly lived with $30 USD for food for a month, to see if he could survive the financial hardships of entrepreneurship. After surviving by eating mostly oranges and hot dogs, he reflected on the experiment and said that, if he could live for a dollar a day for food, **he would be okay no matter what**.

The benefits of practicing poverty are quite intuitive.

First of all, willingly practicing poverty is the perfect way to, well, **save money**. Rather than framing your goal as *“I need to stop spending so much money”* consider switching it to something more like *“I’m going to practice poverty when it comes to X or Y”* — this way you’ll be framing a boring burden into a motivating challenge.

Secondly, as Seneca points out in his letter (more on this in the article), it will also help you **become more grateful** for your regular non-poor meals (yes, this is a recurring theme).

Finally, from a neuroscientific perspective, lowering your dopamine levels will help you reset your dopaminergic basal activation level to a more sensitive one. In other words: it will make coming back to non-poor habits **feel better than ever**.

There are countless ways in which you could implement this exercise, but here are some main ideas:

You can get pretty creative with it: forcing yourself to use **public transport** instead of driving/taxi/uber; switching to **cheaper household** products for a while; dressing in **simpler and cheaper clothes**; **turning off your heating** for a week, **sleeping on the floor** instead of your bed… you name it. If you’re looking for a bigger challenge you could even try ~~sleeping at your local shelter for a weekend~~ *(Edit: as* u/hiraethora *pointed out, this might not be a a great idea. If you decide to do it, make sure you are not denying resources to any of the residents; similarly, consider making a donation to both compensate for your trouble and help their charitable services prosper)* or live one night as a homeless person (sounds hardcore, but it’s actually not that uncommon among people who enjoy backpacking).

The most obvious and straightforward way to willingly practice poverty, however, is by deciding to **eat plain food** for a certain period of time. Perhaps you could eat rice and beans for a whole week/month or save up all the extra money you spend on pastries and sugary goodies. Or both.

The Spartans, after all, were famous for eating ""black soup"" on a daily basis — a disgusting dish made of boiled pigs’ legs, blood, salt and vinegar. Spartan soldiers (which by the way were actually quite well-off) ate this day-in and day-out. According to legend, a man from a city called Sybaris, famous for its absolute luxury and gluttony —which is where the term sybarite comes from— once tasted the Spartan black broth and famously said:

>*“Now I know why the Spartans do not fear death.”*

Obviously, you don't have to go that far... but you get the idea.

# Conclusion

If you are new to Stoicism and have enjoyed reading about these, then I encourage you to check out the article and learn about them in detail, as well as 4 other different practices. These exercises are extremely effective tools for a very specific job: building up your inner Stoic. Trying to use them all at once will most likely not be sustainable. Instead, I recommend that you pick a few of them and integrate them into the next 30 days, as if it were a challenge. As the days go by, try to get a feel for them and don’t be scared to make adjustments.

I would love to discuss them all with you guys, and hear about any interesting new exercises that you might have come up with.

"‘If God had entrusted an orphan to your care, would you have neglected him in such a fashion (as you neglect yourself)?’ - Epictetus","“The Athena of Phidias, once she has stretched out her hand to receive the Victory upon it, remains fixed in that attitude for ever, whereas the works of the gods move and breathe, and are capable of making use of impressions and passing judgements about them. [21] When you yourself are the work of such a maker, will you dishonour him? Not only has he created you, but he has also entrusted you to your own sole charge, [22] and yet will you not only fail to remember that, but also dishonour the charge that he has entrusted to you? If God had entrusted an orphan to your care, would you have neglected him in such a fashion? [23] Yet he has delivered you yourself into your own keeping, and says, ‘I had no one in whom I could put more confidence than you. Keep this person as he was born by nature to be; keep him modest, trustworthy, high-minded, unshakeable, free from passion, imperturbable.’ And after that, don’t you want to keep him so?”

This section to me speaks a great a deal about the importance of caring for oneself as if you were someone you are responsible for. I first noticed this after discovering the lectures of Jordan Peterson. I noticed that I would care more for those that I’m responsible for than I would myself. This made no sense since I, as Seneca says, love myself more than I love others. Yet here I was neglecting myself. Having learned this, I’ve put it into practice.

"“Don’t be ashamed to need help. Like a soldier storming a wall, you have a mission to accomplish. And if you’ve been wounded and you need a comrade to pull you up? So what?” Marcus Aurelius (Meditations, Book 7, Section 7)","“Don’t be ashamed to need help. Like a soldier storming a wall, you have a mission to accomplish. And if you’ve been wounded and you need a comrade to pull you up? So what?” Marcus Aurelius (Meditations, Book 7, Section 7)

                One of the issues I’ve dealt with the most in my life is thinking that I need to go it alone. But where has trying to be an island gotten me? The teachers in my life have taught me, the leaders in my life have led me, and my friends and family have loved me.

                Everyone needs help from time to time, and learning when to ask for it can be one of the hardest things a person can do. Marcus Aurelius one of Rome’s greatest Emperors stated himself, “Don’t be ashamed to need help. Like a soldier storming a wall, you have a mission to accomplish. And if you’ve been wounded and you need a comrade to pull you up? So what?”

                The question, “So what?” has always stuck with me. Your ego is usually the culprit when you fail to ask for help. Not wanting to look weak, foolish, or like an idiot. So, whenever you’re afraid to ask for help remember, “So what?”. So, what you asked for help? If you need it, then ask. Because from a former Soldier I asked for help for times than I could count, and each time I was thankful for the helping hand.

Stop living in your head,"   
  Most of the people that you encounter walking alone on the streets are living in their head. They reduce their perception to things that catch their absolute attention and/or trigger their survival instincts aka things that could harm them (passing cars, cyclists, individuals they consider as weird or beautiful). We could say that when an individual is going from point A to point B he spends 15% of his time looking at and percieving things and 85% living in his head and thinking. 

  
  *Thinking in it's natural form is the foundation of ourselves* 

  
  Now, thinking also got it's negative aspects if you use it falsly. If you think too much about a topic you will eventually end up with negative thoughts since you're stressing your brain out (Overthinking) It also reduces your perception emotionally and exteriorly (tunnel vision), the resulting consequences can be seen as ''lost opportunities'' since you walk past a lot of things that could've potentially catched your attention but didn't since you only accord your perception to things that fall under the ''absolute attention'' and ''survival instict'' category.  

 These ''lost opportunities'' are basically moments where you could've gathered exterior information in order to gain additional knowledge and experiences.   
  When you grow up you are basically getting bombarded with exterior informations in order to learn and survive. At a certain age, let's say 20, you already learned and experienced quite some things, you got your foundation. The years pass and you learn/experience some new things, you got your life together and feel like you accomplished something, yet, there is something that just feels off. 

  
  *Some people never leave that stage*   

  
  This feeling of something being not right mostly comes from the the fact that your interior informations are processed over and over, and that there aren't enough exterior informations comming in in order to create a variety of topics to think about. Since our brain never stops thinking and analyzing it would only be in our intrest to add some informatial variety in order to prevent our thoughts to get sour. 

  
  Sour thoughts: Our thoughts get sour when we think about them too often and/or end up with unfinished thoughts or unclear emotions about a specific topic/thought. 

  
  *Constantly living in your head is unhealthy in a lot of aspects* 

  
  In order to add variety to your thoughts you should try to open your whole FOV (field of vision) in various moments of the day in order to percieve the world that sourrounds you, this creates an automatic absence of deep thoughts which translates to deep exterior awareness which is essential for an eased state of mind. 

  
  To express it in a much simpler form:   

  
  You have to stop to constantly live in your head, open your eyes, pay attention to small details that surround you on your path. 

  
  *Live in the moment, observe without judging*

"With the loss of faith in my religion, “Meditations” essentially became my replacement for the Bible.","I was a fundamentalist, southern-baptist Christian. Fully believed every word in the Bible, and it was my source of hope and my purpose in life. You can imagine what happened when I lost my faith at 19.

Nietzsche talked about the removal of religion and the harm it can do, stating its not the absence of religion that leads people to despair, it’s the withdrawal of it. Losing my faith flipped my worldview on its head. I was completely lost and had no idea where to turn. Everything my life was based on was swept out from under me.

It took a toll on me; I fell into depression and battled it throughout my freshman year of college. Soon after, though, I found philosophy. The first branch I heard of was stoicism. Desperate for something, I was recommended “meditations”, and I picked it up right away.

Oh, man. The first two chapters blew me away. I remember tears of joy from the words I was reading. In a world where previously I was taught that I’m “worthless” and “nothing” without god, Marcus Aurelius gave me guidance. It was the guidance I had before, but without the dogma; it felt real. That was over a year ago, and since then I’ve learned to come to peace with my existence, but the peace that I felt while reading Meditations is something I will never forget.

Edit: thank you everyone for the words. I’m glad people can relate and it makes me happy I’m not alone.

Edit 2: just to be clear: no, stoicism isn’t my new “religion” and Marcus Aurelius isn’t my new “god”. I was really just saying how in the absence of my trust in the Bible meditations was grounding for me.",Stoicism,1591741113.0,t3_gzxokw,0.96,1257

The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury.,"This quote from Aurelius in Meditations has really stuck with me in the last few days.

Recently, a close friend of mine has decided to lash out, be cold, say horrible things about me behind my back and attempt to ruin my reputation in our tight knit friend group for reasons unbeknownst to me.

I have remained silent throughout the entire thing. Any time someone brings her up, or asks what happened, I only reply with I wish her the best and have nothing negative to say about her, or say nothing at all.
It’s amazing how much happier and at peace I feel lately to mind my own business and not get involved in any drama. A few years ago, before being introduced to stoic philosophy, this would have gone much uglier.

I have quickly learned how much power is in utter silence.

Edit to add: I don’t necessarily view this as revenge. I don’t want to get revenge, because I genuinely care about her as a person and want the best for her; despite how immensely disappointed I was. I am more or less proud of how far I’ve come in this stoic journey of mine- since 2 years ago I know I absolutely would have sought revenge on her in an ugly manner for doing this. But, I cannot control how she feels about me or what she says. I can only control how I feel about myself, and my actions. And that is so liberating.",Stoicism,1611450183.0,t3_l3p1d6,0.99,1255

Stoicism is about controlling your reactions instead of having no reactions at all.,"It seems like many people think stoicism means not doing or saying anything at all whenever someone insults you.

Its true that nothing can harm you if you dont think that it harms you.

So some people who wanna practise stoicism just stay quiet and let other people do as they please. They allow others to humiliate them infront of others or give in in important matters.

But its also true that the obstacle on the way becomes the way.

That means that whenever you encouter a situation where someone is trying to humiliate you or attack you, its an opportunity to practise certain virtues.

If someone is shouting at you

1. Check your reaction

2. Ask yourself: What is the antidote for this? ( Think in terms of Fire-Water )

3. React in the proper way. Usually calm but also just.

Stoicism is NOT about being actionless. In fact its about doing the right actions, having the right reactions.

And if the subject you are debating about is important and you are confident that your position is Just, do not give in. Stay Calm but rock solid.",Stoicism,1623096342.0,t3_num4x4,0.99,1249
"“To feel affection for people even when they make mistakes is uniquely human. You can do it, if you simply recognize: that they’re human too, that they act out of ignorance against their will, and that you’ll both be dead before long.

You win the battles you walk away from by not reacting to it,"My pride used to tell me this was weakness. How dare someone say whatever they want to me and get away with it? How do I defend myself and make them feel the anger they’ve caused me? How can I make them see that I’m not who they think I am? The best revenge is not to be like them. I realized this was a trauma response but now I would much rather have peace than to be right. 

Not reacting to situations gives me the upper hand. Sometimes I even sit back and smile as the other person gets so upset with me doing nothing. Decide it’s not going to get a rise out of you and it won’t. That’s how you make the other person powerless.

I have been doing this backwards choosing to be jealous of the qualities of others. Thinking over this quote makes me realize how silly that is. Why should I be envious of others whose own qualities are used to help? I am jealous because I wish I could be that clever, empathic, intelligent, or confident; silly. I can flip my script instead and focus on how lucky to be around so many quality people.

TIL that Marcus Aurelius died in a pandemic that lasted 14 years.,"His writings in ""Meditations"" take on a deeper meaning given that context! \*mind blown\* The epidemic also lasted \_14 years\_ across two different waves. Talk about dealing through tough times as a ruler...

All I can say is, I'm so thankful his writings are still accessible today.

&#x200B;

Marcus' last words:

>“**Weep not for me; think rather of the pestilence and the deaths of so many others**.”

So sad to think how world leadership went from that to what we have today...

Although I cannot find info about where it was taken from, any ideas? Maybe some Russian speaking people can help find it you in the original work from Tolstoy?

**Edit 2**: [Asked on Russian literature subredit](https://www.reddit.com/r/RussianLiterature/comments/mlz61s/need_help_with_finding_original_text_of/)

It was indeed written in the [original text from Leo Tolstoy](https://www.reddit.com/r/RussianLiterature/comments/mlz61s/need_help_with_finding_original_text_of/gtouxh1?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (thank's to [u/ComradeCatilina](https://www.reddit.com/u/ComradeCatilina/)), see: [https://www.prlib.ru/item/394311](https://www.prlib.ru/item/394311) (p. 33-34 of the scan)

So it's not a problem of the english translation contrary to [what  wikiquote says](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/mlyeyq/the_object_of_life_is_not_to_be_on_the_side_of/gto6g2e?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) .

In (modern) Russian the quote is like this: Задача жизни не в том, чтобы быть на стороне большинства, а в том, чтобы не попасть в ряды умалишённых

It does not point unfortunately to the sources, so I don't know where the citation is from.

**Edit 3:** Thanks to u/mahendrabirbikram I have found out that Leo Tolstoy probably took it from [russian translation of Meditations (Марк Аврелий. Размышления. Перевод князя XI:24, p.168)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/%D0%9C%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BA_%D0%90%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B9._%D0%A0%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%BC%D1%8B%D1%88%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F._%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4_%D0%BA%D0%BD%D1%8F%D0%B7%D1%8F_%D0%9B._%D0%A3%D1%80%D1%83%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0_%281882%29.pdf?uselang=ru) .

Which corresponds roughly to:

>XXXI. 'Of the free will there is no thief or robber:' out of Epictetus; Whose is this also: that we should find a certain art and method of assenting; and that we should always observe with great care and heed the inclinations of our minds, that they may always be with their due restraint and reservation, always charitable, and according to the true worth of every present object. And as for earnest longing, that we should altogether avoid it: and to use averseness in those things only, that wholly depend of our own wills. It is not about ordinary petty matters, believe it, that all our strife and contention is, but whether, with the vulgar, we should be mad, or by the help of philosophy wise and sober, said he.

or [https://lexundria.com/m\_aur\_med/11/lg](https://lexundria.com/m_aur_med/11/lg)

>**36** No man can rob us of our free will. (Epictetus, iii. 22.)  
>  
>**37** Epictetus also said, a man must discover an art \[or rules\] with respect to giving his assent; and in respect to his movements he must be careful that they be made with regard to circumstances, that they be consistent with social interests, that they have regard to the value of the object; and as to sensual desire, he should altogether keep away from it; and as to avoidance \[aversion\] he should not show it with respect to any of the things which are not in our power.  
>  
>**38** The dispute then, he said, is not about any common matter, but about being mad or not.

So seems the exact quote is more a result of multiple translations than what actually M. Aurelius said. Looks like the russian translation used French as base. Quite fascinating!

Anybody French and can help me find it in French translations of Meditations? I found [one translation from 1803](https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Ya2fqX3YzQsC&hl=pl&pg=GBS.PA371) Pensées de l'empereur Marc-Aurele-Antonin, traduites du grec par M. de Joly.

>Задача жизни не в том, чтобы быть на стороне большинства, а в том, чтобы не попасть в ряды умалишённых

Comes from Τα εις εαυτον (About himself) part of Meditation and it does correspond to:

>Οὐ περὶ τοῦ τυχόντος οὖν"", ἔφη, ""ἐστὶν ὁ ἀγών, ἀλλὰ περὶ τοῦ μαίνεσθαι ἢ μή.

Which is in current translation:

>**38** The dispute then, he said, is not about any common matter, but about being mad or not.

Also great thanks to u/orvn who [pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/translator/comments/mmbyh7/old_russian_french_1800_ancient_greek_tracing/gtrmhvn?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

>Умалишённый in Russian does refer to people who have lost their mind in modern Russian. However the etymology of the word is interesting, because it's a portmanteau of ума(or разум) and лишения. Literally this means empty of sense or intelligence.  
>  
>So if a mistranslation did occur here, the original intent might have been not to refer to insanity. Rather that the goal of life is to avoid becoming one of those who does not use their mind/wit/sensibilities.

This further strengthens that this could be indeed passage **38**.

So passage **comes indeed from** **Marcus Aurelius ""Meditations"", but he was not the one who said it**. Although thought multiple translation it changed it's meaning.

**It was Epictetus**, in [the Discourses as reported by Arrian](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Epictetus,_the_Discourses_as_reported_by_Arrian,_the_Manual,_and_Fragments/Fragments):

>When you attack someone with vehemence and threatening, remember to tell yourself beforehand that you are a tame animal; and then you will never do anything fierce, and so will come to the end of your life without having to repent, or to be called to account.  
>  
>You are a little soul, carrying around a corpse, as Epictetus used to say.  
>  
>We must discover, said he, an art that deals with assent, and in the sphere of the choices we must be careful to maintain close attention, that they be made with due reservations, that they be social, and that they be according to merit; and from desire we must refrain altogether, and must exercise aversion towards none of the things that are not under our control.  
>  
>**It is no ordinary matter that is at stake, said he, but it is a question of either madness or sanity**.

Thinking like Marcus aurelius,"Me and my girlfriend broke up yesterday together for 7 months but it was genuine infatuation. She said we needed to talk so we did. She was telling me all those things such as ""falling out of love"" and that whilst crying uncontrollably. I had a foresight this was happened so I subconsciously thought, what would Marcus aurelius do? I told her ""cherish the times we've had, you need to be alone, its nature for this to happen, and you're giving me back to nature. ""
Now, today I thought : its over, we aren't compatible and nature has chosen to separate us for our own good. 

It may be hard in the coming times but I'm proud of myself for discovering stoicism and the aura of happiness given to me by seeing my friends prior to the event.

So basically a guy was just sending me memes the whole time instead of meaningful messages. I needed to know the stoic thing to do. The general advice I got was

1) why do you even care, let the memes wash over you (Stoic indeference?)

2) just block and move on (this felt cowardly and not courageous)

3) Have the courageous conversation that you don't dig this


I went with option 3. and the reason why is the four stoic virtues 

Wisdom,
Courage,
Temperance,
Justice

Here is what i sent

Hey dude, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but i sometimes find it hard to respond because you mostly send imporsonal messages about memes or covid news or seemingly random stuff.  I'm hoping we can send personal messages instead and stay away from memes, news and forwarded stuff. I think that way we can create more meaningful connections. For example yesterday was Christmas, instead of sending me a message about it you are sending a random toast video 😃


His response

Morning. Sure no problem 😎🤝🏽
I agree no more random vids and memes.

Our team gathered together — doctors, nurses, support staff, and even administrators — and with the guidance of our social workers, we shared what we were feeling about recent patient losses. We listened to each other. We cried together. I allowed my team to see a vulnerable side of myself, the side that had been told since medical school never to show herself, or else. Or else what? Because here’s the thing, nothing bad happened. In fact, good things happened. Both social workers thanked me afterward for my candor and for “being willing to show emotion” in front of the team because, they said, it gave the rest of the team permission to show their emotions, too. Wow, I thought, does that mean before this grief session, my team didn’t think I felt the same things that they did surrounding patient loss?  

Then I realized that from our first days of medical school, doctors are conditioned to hide their emotions away; to suppress and conceal. And because I hadn’t ever spoken to my team about my grief over patient losses before, they assumed I didn’t experience it to the same degree. Suppressing these feelings kind of made me feel less than human, which is definitely not the way I want to be perceived by my team (or my patients).""

"I may have Covid 19, my stoic view.","I have ticked all the check-boxes, I wear a mask (perhaps more than necessary) wash my hands, and stay isolated save my children, mother, girlfriend, and her son. I controlled what I could. However the past few days I have had a fever, though no coughing. It may just be a mild flu, too. No less I am getting tested tomorrow.

Epictitus, and Marcus remind us over and over our bodies are not ours. They also remind us that life is short, and to keep death in mind because fortune can turn in a moment's notice. I sat on my couch last night, and used negative visualization to extrapolate the worst case. I have Covid, and I am going to die alone from it. This means that Thursday was the last time I hugged my children of 12 and 7, my house, career, car, all of it is meaningless, but this is all out of my control now.

Why die shamefully? Why show my kids that death is indignant, and that its ""not fair?"" I got 40 years! I have a strong body, have made good use of it, have touch peoples lives, and have two good kids who enjoy being with their father and learning stoic principles.

If worse comes to be, which is unlikely, I am thankful for my life and what I made if it, especially when I started down the path of stoicism several years ago. Many people live lives where they cannot say they even get several good years.

I have already accepted death a few years ago and it has made my life much richer. It keeps first things first, and I have come to value things that do not cost any money. My anxiety and stress is little, and cherishing each moment makes live very long. It also allows me not to suffer in advance, since that is suffering in excess. It is the reason I am sitting here with a pounding headache typing this, but smile at the birds dancing about my bird-feeder, while I enjoy the quietude of an early summer morning.

Anyway, Via face time, zoom, or whatever platform I will see my children if worse came to be, I will be cheerful, loving, and supportive to the very end. There is no other way to be! I have a job to do until my very last breath and will do it, this is what we are taught, this is why we practice.

I finally stopped caring about what other people think,"I was on the train standing next to these high school guys, and one of them was ordering a curry online on his phone or something which led to his friend asking him if Indians shower everyday (they are both not Indian by the way). Now, myself being Indian I kinda tensed up when he said this as we were standing quite close and I thought he was talking about me, cause even when I wear a mask I still look Indian. Then his friend started to say how Indians smell weird and in the past, I would have got very self conscious and maybe even started to cry. However, I realised that this is the perfect opportunity to practice stoicism and I realised that what they say and think about Indians and other people in general is beyond my control. I didn’t let what they said affect me and that felt really good. However I did want to stand up for myself and say something but i thought it would be really awkward cause the train was quite full and they hadn’t realised they were saying this next to an Indian person.

The Story of the Chinese Farmer : Alan Watts,"Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.” The farmer said, “Maybe.” The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!” The farmer again said, “Maybe.” 

The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, “Oh dear, that’s too bad,” and the farmer responded, “Maybe.” The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, “Isn’t that great!” Again, he said, “Maybe.”

Things like weather, death, love we can't control, but things like our thoughts, our perspective, taking care of ourselves, are those things we can control.

My list of rules for a stoic life.,"A few years ago I wrote down two handfuls of guiding principles or rules that would give me some kind of safety rails for life, something I could turn to when I was facing the frequent uncertainty of how to act in difficult situations but also in day to day existence.

Most of what I wrote down were lessons I learned from reading Marcus and Seneca but there was also inspiration from Miyamoto Musashi's [Dokkōdō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dokkōdō) (where I got the idea to make a list) and principles of Zen Buddhism that got thrown in there.

I don’t claim to have any profound answers or that these rules are even close to the most important one should adhere to, but they have helped me tremendously and on the chance that someone else might also find value in them I thought I’d share them.

So without further ado, here's the list:

&#x200B;

1. **To dedicate your life to something, even if it lacks meaning to others.**
2. **The process is the goal, every action, however seemingly meaningless should be performed with great care. You are building your own temple, chop wood, carry water.**
3. **Nature has given you emotions so that they can be of use to you, so observe them and let only those come to the surface that are of service to you.**
4. **Take care of your body and your mind, for the body is your vessel and your mind it’s operator.**
5. **To not be roused by distressing events or by other peoples actions and treatment of you for you cannot change them. But to care deeply about how you respond and how you treat them.**
6. **To not attach yourself to material possessions and simple pleasures and to not mourn the loss of them. To be as fulfilled living in a hut as in a palace. But to also recognize that abolishing material pleasures completely is not desirable, and to enjoy them in disciplined moderation.**
7. **To be complete in yourself. To not depend on anyone for happiness or completion.**
8. **To accept and understand but not to succumb to your preconceived notions.**
9. **To recognize the potential for goodness and evil in everyone as in yourself.**
10. **If one has to think of the past or the future it should be a deliberate practice, otherwise one should not dwell on what will be or what has been and be present.**",Stoicism,1623533833.0,t3_nyh9z4,0.99,1169

The 3 Stoic Disciplines,"I’ve noticed many of the posts here have become people seeking advice or talking about their personal experiences wherein they apply Stoicism. However I see very few posts regarding the original logical dialectic, references to Stoic texts, etc. 

I seek to give people tangible and practical ways in which they can apply stoicism to their lives, and I’ll do so here by explaining the “three disciplines”.

Epictetus described a threefold division between *lived* stoic practice. 

1.	“The Discipline of Desire”, which has to do with acceptance of our fate
2.	“The Discipline of Action”, which has to do with philanthropy or love of mankind
3.	“The Discipline of Assent”, which has to do with mindfulness of our judgements

Marcus Aurelius references the disciplines a few times through *Meditations* and it’s clear he was influenced by Epictetus.

**1.	The Discipline of Desire (a.k.a. Stoic Acceptance)**

The discipline of desire is the virtue of living in accordance with Nature or the Universe as a Whole. This includes having a philosophical attitude toward life and accepting our Fate as inevitable. Fate here is not some mysterious metaphysical force of predetermination. It simply means the causal network of events that bring about subsequent events (cause and effect).

*“Seek not for events to happen as you wish but wish events to happen as they do and your life will go smoothly and serenely.”* (Enchiridion, VIII)

This does not mean be a push over or live life passively (this paradox will be explained in the discipline of action).

All in all, the discipline of desire is the calm acceptance of everything out of our immediate control; desiring to align that which is in our control with virtue, and not desiring that which is out of our control.

**2. The Discipline of Action (Stoic Philanthropy)**

According to Stoic tradition, virtue is the only good and is sufficient to live a life of fulfillment (*eudaimonia*). This discipline includes developing the four Stoic virtues and ‘taming’ the four passions. 

The IV Virtues

I. Courage - overcoming fear or aversion to what ought to be done (fortitude, bravery)
II. Temperance - overcoming attracting or desire to what ought not to be done (moderation, discipline)
III. Wisdom - knowing what ought to be done and ought to be avoided (discernment, right judgment)
IV. Justice - thought and action resulting in the common good (morality, fairness, benevolence)

The IV Passions

I. Fear - irrational aversion to something falsely judged as bad (cowardice, procrastination)
II. Craving - irrational attraction to something falsely judged as good (gluttony, greed, addiction)
III. Pain - irrational sadness over something falsely judged as bad (moping, self-pity)
IV. Elation - irrational happiness over something falsely judged as good (over-excitement, indulgence)

The discipline of action is essentially undertaking all action in harmony with our fellow humans, as well as helping them flourish (i.e. live a life of *eudaimonia*), pursing actions in accordance with the virtues and avoiding the passions. Or, at least making sure our actions don’t go *against* our virtues and the good of mankind. However, because the condition of others is out of our control, we should undertake these actions with a “reserve clause” such as “Fate permitting”, “God-willing”, etc., always remembering that our actions can be obstructed.

Hence, Marcus Aurelius appears to refer to three clauses that Stoics should be continually mindful to attach to all of their actions:

1.	That they are undertaken “with a reserve clause” (hupexairesis)
2.	That they are “for the common welfare” of mankind (koinônikai)
3.	That they “accord with value” (kat’ axian)

Value is in reference to the “preferred indifferents”. Stoics are indifferent to what is out of their control, including life and death, health and disease, etc. However, life is preferable to death, health to disease, financial stability to poverty, etc. and thus we are allowed to pursue these things “in accord with value”.

**3. The Discipline of Assent (Stoic Mindfulness)**

The discipline of assent is the virtue of living in accordance with our nature as rational beings, which means living in accord with reason and truth in our thoughts and speech. 

Assent is in reference to which thoughts or impression we agree with. It consists of monitoring our inner voice and confronting our value judgements. For instance, when we hear of a death, our inner voice may say “That is tragic”. If we give assent to this impression, then we judge the event as tragic even though it was in accordance with nature. Instead we should catch the impression and ask “Was this death truly tragic, or is it nature running its course? All things must come to an end eventually. Is that truly a tragedy?” and so on. 

“Men are not disturbed by things, but by the views which they take of things.” (Enchiridion, V)



(Although it can seem like doctrine, Stoicism is not a religion and shouldn’t be practiced dogmatically. As always, extract what you want and apply it as you wish. This is from the original Stoic teachings and thus can be modified to fit modern practice of Stoicism. God knows I don’t practice everything in this post.)",Stoicism,1617304730.0,t3_mi2rno,0.99,1154
Just realized Stoicism is perfect for dating,"What's great about Stoicism is that you learn how to value yourself, you learn how to react to your own emotions and you can't control your partner/date/hook-up's feelings...why the hell isn't Stoicism taught more in the dating scene?? Part of Stoicism is not giving a shit what other people think about you, that is a perfect principle for dating. Sometimes you get ghosted (whatever, that's her/his decision) and sometimes you're not their type (that's fine, hope he/she can find happiness with someone else). Yes it's hard, and yes it can downright be depressing when you get your heartbroken. But something I've learned from a heartbreak (and this is coming from a guy who wears his heart on a sleeve) is this...you can choose to use that heartbreak as an opportunity to grow. 

So many people get themselves heartbroken in the worst ways and in the the most extreme cases suicidal! The best part about dating is this...there are plenty of other options. 7.7 BILLION people on this and he/she is the ""only"" one for you? Whether you're just hooking up or finding a steady relationships, at the end of the day you're still a master of your own emotions. Now sometimes you may catch feelings (again I'm a victim of this too), but you learn that's there really isn't ""the one"" but more ""the one for you"". You learn that you can find love with almost anyone if the chemistry is right.

These are just my 2 cents, I want to know what y'all beautiufl individuals think of this too.

Stoicism saved my life.,"Just little over a few months ago, I was going through a suicidal moment. Then one day I saw the word “stoicism” and started searching up the philosophy and it’s principles. It took me two weeks to read a bunch of books and articles to understand the concept of this philosophy before applying it to my life. And here I am, happy as ever and living. Stoicism has changed my life, it has saved my life. If you need to change the way you live your life to save your life, it is worth it.

Epictetus on the reason why we are anxious,"When I see someone in a state of anxiety, I say, ‘What is it that he wants?’ For unless he wanted something that was not within his power, how could he still be anxious? [2] That is why a lyre-player* feels no anxiety when singing on his own, but becomes anxious when he enters the theatre, even if he has a fine voice and plays his instrument well. For he wants not only to sing well, but also to win the approval of his audience, and that is something that lies beyond his control. [3] Where he has skill, then, he has self-assurance too; bring any layman you please in front of him and he won’t be concerned; but where it is a case of something that he doesn’t know and has never studied, there he feels anxious. [4] So what does this mean? That he doesn’t know what a crowd is, or the applause of a crowd. He has learned, to be sure, how to strike the low and high notes, but what the praise of the mass of people is, and what value it holds in life, these are things that he neither knows nor has ever studied

How I've turned buying ice cream into a stoic practice,"This has been my secret for the past several months, and I call it a “secret,” because I’m not one to brag about good deeds. If you ever catch me giving money or food to the homeless on video for clout, please don’t hesitate to kick my ass. That being said, on the internet we’re all strangers to a degree so here it goes. 

Every day I take at least one walk. There’s a park in my neighborhood and a lap around it, and back to my apartment is almost exactly a mile. On these strolls I make it a rule to never take my headphones, and this opportunity to walk and think has become one of my favorite parts of my day. I pass tennis courts, baseball fields, a dog park, a Japanese garden, and skatepark. Each of these scenes offers an opportunity for people watching, and I’ve found a growing sense of sympatheia in enjoying the outdoors with so many others. 

A few months back I was kicking around the idea of righteous action in my mind. I came to the conclusion that the operating word here is action not righteous. We hear it all the time: talk not action. People will claim that they are a good person in order to combat a morally ambiguous action they’ve just committed. They’ll say if I had that kind of money then I would do A,B, and C to fight injustice, but I can’t because I don't. We’re all too familiar with that one guy friend who thinks he’s tough who asserts he would have made a difference on X situation if only they had been there. This guy tends to cause an eye roll on every head within a quarter mile radius. Ultimately, all of these are nothing more than empty words that add up to nothing.

As I was thinking about this, I turned a corner and saw a line of young skaters waiting to be served by an ice truck that is perpetually parked outside of the park. They were huddled together, passing singles back and forth so that they would have enough to order whatever they wanted from the truck. Instead of passing the truck like I usually do, I asked them if they would mind if I paid for whatever they wanted from the truck. They asked me if I was serious, I told them that I was, and they agreed. They were very thankful and polite about it, but I wasn’t about to hang around a bunch of 13 year old's as a man nearing 30 (that hurt to type), so as soon I as paid I was on my way back home. 

Then the next day the same thing happened. Line of skaters get a free treat on me. They’re stoked, I get to say I did a good deed to myself, and it’s a win-win. This repeats itself many times over the past several months. Sometimes there’s one kid, sometimes there seems to be an entire basketball team in line. As of recently, there does seem to be a bigger line than usual whenever I begin to pass the park…

But who cares? The reason I do it is not for good karma, or so that I can brag about it to my friends. I’ve told no one that I do this. The objective of me doing this is that I have a memorable experience on a daily basis that reminds me that action is the most important aspect of living a righteous life.

It’s like Macus said, *“Waste no time arguing what a good man should be. Be one.”*

Yesterday, something special happened that inspired me to write this post. As I was approaching the truck, I made my stop and asked a group of skaters if I could pay for their stuff, which they agreed to. This time there was another adult in line, and he asked what I was doing. I responded by saying, “I’m just picking up this tab. I didn’t have any money when I was their age, so it’s just something that I like to do,” and then I offered to pay for his stuff as well. 

He refused me, and instead asked if he could split the tab with me. I told him it was fine, but he insisted by removing cash from his pocket and placing it in my hands with one hand folded over mine.

“Take it,” he said. “I want to help.”

So I let him help. We both picked up the bill, and he thanked me for letting him pay. Later that night I was thinking about it a bit more, and came to the conclusion that practicing righteous action through compassion and kindness is candy for the soul. It’s putting positive energy back into the world that desperately needs it. But the evolution of this is inspiring other people to do the same. 

Yesterday, it was some random guy at the park offering to split the bill. Maybe tomorrow one of these kids will internalize the free ice cream, and help their mom out by doing the dishes. Maybe one of you will read this, and go show some love to someone who needs it. 

It’s a domino effect. Empathy breeds empathy. Whatever you put out in the world has a lasting effect that we might never see, but our actions here on earth ripple through eternity. 

Instead of thinking about how we can be good, or talking about how we can better, why don’t we just do it? Oftentimes it’s much easier than we think it's going to be. The key is taking action.",Stoicism,1637598428.0,t3_qzp9z9,0.98,1138
"Stoicism has turned my partner cold and distant. I want to support and embrace stoicism, but I can't.","**Edit:  So this blew up when I went to work.  I really appreciate all of the responses everyone has given. I've taken the time to read them all, and will re-read as well at my leisure.  A lot of things resonated with me, and I honestly did not think I'd have such an amazing response to this.**

Hello stoics,

This is a bit of a rant from the opposite side.  I've read some basic stoicism, and honestly I do 100% find value in a lot of the teachings (The Obstacle is the Way got me through losing my job at the beginning of COVID, William Irving's The Stoic Path is a great short series of meditations), but I have trouble with the true depths of it.  

While I dabbled in stoicism and tried to apply its wisdoms to my daily life as a casual reminder (I was fair weather stoic, I suppose), my partner has completely embraced it as a framework for his life.  I supported this, of course, and didn't say anything when he slowly started wearing his headphones all day while listening to audiobooks on stoicism, or meditating for an hour or more each morning and evening.

After some time of this I brought up my concerns that I feel like he's disconnected from me a little bit.  He confirmed that yes, he's removing attachments in his mind so as to not be bothered by the feelings of other people (i.e. me).  But, if I'm coming to him because I'm upset about something, I want him to react.  I don't want a blank stare and a ""You can choose to own your feelings or not, but they're not my responsibility"".  

This is where the turn happens in my mind.  There is nothing kind or virtuous or strong in becoming cold towards the people in your life in exchange for building a wall of strength and unmoveability.  

William Irving fervently insists that stoics being negative human beings is a stereotype and simply not true.  But is this cold negativity a phase all young stoics go through before coming out the other side and finding the balance of stoicism, wisdom, virtue, but also love and kindness and personality?  

Stoic meditation is a practice in appreciating what you have in the present.  Things like the Last Time Meditation or Prospective Introspection are purely there to essentially convince yourself that you love your life, despite the fact that it probably sucks.  Why would one have to throw themselves to deeply into practicing these meditations if they were happy?  Why do you need to convince yourself so aggressively that your life is good?  I don't need to meditate for hours a day to feel happy with, and in, my life.    **I'd in particular love if someone can change my view on this.  I'm very much struggling with this point here.**

"When first studying stoicism, I watched videos and wrote about the 12 rules of stoicism from the Enchiridion by Epictetus. I felt that maybe it was selfish to keep it myself, so here it is. This is what I wrote, enjoy!","1. Examine your impressions.

\-Ask ""Is this something that is in my control?"". If the answer is yes, act

on it rationally. If the answer is no, then ignore it.

\-Examine your reactions to the things around you.

\-Don't make impulsive emotional reactions to circumstances but instead

make rational decisions based on them.

\-Don't think about minor past decisions that can no longer be changed

or improved upon. Just 'keep calm and carry on' when faced with bad or

unfortunate circumstances.

&#x200B;

2. Remind yourself of the impermanence of things.

\-Understand that thing are changing constantly and universally.

\-Appreciate what and who you have now because life and everything around

you is impermanent.

\-Be happy that you can enjoy the things that you have in the present but

also that realise that those feelings of enjoyment can end abruptly.

\-Don't cling to the things that you enjoy and learn to realise and accept

that you are not entitled to them and you shouldn't cling to them.

&#x200B;

3. 'The Reserve Clause'.

\-Whenever planning an action, rehearse what your plan entails.

\-Realise that everyone, good or bad, faces certain situations which can be uncomfortable

or sad etc.

\-Face all situations with the best of your abilities whilst leaving what

must be left to the outcome to fate.

\-Sometimes things won't go your way, whether you deserved it or not.

&#x200B;

4. How can you use virtue here and now?

\-For every challenge, remember to use the resources that you have to cope

with it.

\-Use every challenge as a way to exercise your virtue in order to become a

better human being through constant application.

\-Look for ways to improve yourself from past situations and experiences.

\-Realise that you probably have a lot more self-control and patience than you

would generally think.

&#x200B;

5. Pause and take a deep breath.

\-Remember that in order to be harmed, you must not only be hit or insulted, but you

must also believe that you are being harmed. If someone seeks to provoke you, realise

that your mind is complicit in that provocation if you react by becoming provoked.

\-Rationally examine your impressions. Do not react immediately and instinctively to either

negative or positive emotions and situations, in order to act or react rationally.

\-Pause and take a deep breath, go for a walk or do something that will calm you down and

make sure that you can act rationally, before making an important decision or reaction.

\-Consider issues with logic and calmness.

&#x200B;

6. 'Other-ize'.

\-Realise that other people's hardships are just as distressing as your own and consider the effects

that those circumstances would have or have had on you. Also think about how something bad happening

to you would effect other people if they were in the same circumstances instead of you.

\-Realise that events affecting other people affect you very differently when the event happens to you

instead.

\-Realise that other people going through hard situations are often probably acting in a similar way to

which you would, so don't judge them too harshly for how they are reacting.

\-Realise that bad situations are normal occurrences and happen to everyone.

\-Understand that the universe isn't out to get anyone in particular, including you.

&#x200B;

7. Speak little and well.

\-Only say what is necessary. Don't talk about boring, uninteresting and unimportant things

when you are called to speak and above all else, don't gossip about other people or overly

praise or blame them for things.

\-Try to at least somewhat occasionally introduce challenging topics into conversations when

appropriate.

&#x200B;

8. Choose your company well.

\-Avoid people who are not good company such as people who are 'dirty' and the people surrounding

them also.

\-Pay close attention to who you spend you time your time with.

\-Consider of other people ""Are they making me a better person?"", ""Do they encourage me to push forwards?""

or ""Do they drag me down to their level?"" before letting them into your life.

&#x200B;

9. Respond to insults with humour.

\-Do not take insults too personally.

\-Insults are not in your control but how you react to them is.

\-Be comedically self-deprecating when appropriate after being insulted and learn to laugh at yourself.

&#x200B;

10. Don't speak too much about yourself.

\-Realise that just because you may enjoy talking about yourself, others may not enjoy listening to you doing so.

\-Understand that talking about yourself most likely releases dopamine, this being the reason why you feel the

need to do so.

\-Exercise some self-control and refrain from talking about yourself too much.

&#x200B;

11.Speak without judgement of others.

\-Do not say someone washes themselves badly, just that they wash themselves quickly for example, or that a person

drinks a lot of alcohol, instead of that they drink alcohol badly.

\-Realise that you cannot know whether people's actions are good or bad until you know the reasoning behind them.

\-Observe things literally and rationally and do not attach judgements to them.

\-Try to view the world as objectively as possible.

\-Look at people's characters and personalities as a whole instead of singling out their bad characteristics.

&#x200B;

12. Reflect on your day.

\-Look at the good things you have done and congratulate yourself and think of how you can improve on yourself

for the bad things that you have done throughout the day.

\-The philosophy isn't just about thinking, it is also about action.

\-Review your ethical performance for the day.

\-Don't beat yourself up about things that you did or how you acted, just forgive yourself and remember to find a way

to learn from both your good and bad actions to further improve yourself and try to repeat the good things that you did

throughout the day in the next day as well.

\-Be grateful for the good that has happened throughout the day.

Stoicism is a diet and not a medicine.,"I've said it on this sub before, but I keep seeing posts asking for stoic™ solutions, so I thought maybe it might help someone to repeat it.

Stoicism isn't a hodgepodge of solutions. You can't just jam a chunk of stoicism™ into your anxiety and voila! Life is a rainbow! No.

It's a diet. It's a form of discipline you stick to every day (as best you can) not for any pay-off, but because it's a good diet. It's fascinating and fun in and of itself. It's a bit like ""an apple a day keeps the doctor away"". You get healthier and stronger on a diet of stoicism, and you'll find a lot of areas of your life will improve.

"You may leave this life at any moment: have this possibility in your mind in all that you do or say or think. (Marcus Aurelius, Meditations 2.11)","Life is like a visit to the beach. For some, when they arrive, the sun is shining and water is warm. For others, it may be storming with waves crashing against the shore. We can't control the weather, but only our reaction to it. If conditions are difficult, then the fortitude and courage we display in the face of adversity has meaning in of itself for we will know that we have acted with dignity. We proved ourselves worthy.

The time we spend here is brief and everything that we build are sandcastles: they will be gone soon after we've left, or even be wiped out while we build them. Wealth and power will all be gone in a few generations. We should do our best work despite this, for it is not the result of our work but the process that gives it meaning. 

In the meantime, if we can help those around us, for that moment we can ease the suffering of others. Love the ones around you and care for them. Just like you, they feel fear, anxiety, joy, pleasure, anger, and love. When you help one person, you help their entire world.

A Quote on Optimistic Nihilism,"""You only get one shot at life, which is scary, but it also sets you free. If the universe ends in heat death, every humiliation you suffer in your life will be forgotten. Every mistake you made will not matter in the end. Every bad thing you did will be voided. If our life is all we get to experience, then it's the only thing that matters. If the universe has no principles, the only principles relevant are the ones we decide on. If the universe has no purpose, then we get to dictate what its purpose is. Humans will most certainly cease to exist at some point, but before we do, we get to explore ourselves and the world around us. We get to experience feelings. We get to experience food, books, sunrises, and being with each other. The fact that we're even able to think about these things is already kind of incredible. It's easy to think of ourselves as separated from everything, but this is not true. We are as much the universe as a neutron star, or a black hole, or a nebula. Even better, actually, we are its thinking and feeling part: the centre organs of the universe. We are truly free in a universe-sized playground, so we might as well aim to be happy and to build some kind of utopia in the stars."" - Kurzgesagt (youtube channel)

Last night I finally snapped,"I have been under a lot of pressure and stress lately, and I may have finally run out of fucks to give. 

Finding myself awake at 4am for no reason other than anxiety, I decided to throw the towel about worrying about everything.

- The problems between my parents are their own. Unless they hurt each other, their problems are theirs. They are not children and they don't need me to solve their problems.

- My (mentally challenged) brother wants to ruin his life with bad choices and bad friends? So be it. He is not my responsibility currently. And I made it clear to my parents that he will never be. I can help him of course, he is my brother, but I cannot help who doesn't want to be helped.

- My neighbours kids keep making noise in the apartment complex? No need to feel anxious right now. Once I move in (I'm rennovating), I can deal with that problem then. Right now I am wasting energy worrying about something that I cannot solve (at the moment)
- Studies and work problems - I just have two hands. I cannot do everything at the same time. I am learning to manage my time efficiently and I will tackle problems **one at a time**.

- Whatever other people think of me, its not my concern. People talk shit about everyone. I am not immune or special. Hell, people crucified Jesus Christ, they would absolutely wreck me if they were given the chance

- I am not and cannot be in control of everything. I accept that and from now on will only focus on what I can control. No more going out of my way to help or please people. I am simply human. If I wanted to please people, I would go on and sell ice cream like Steve Jobs once said.

- I accept I am flawed. And that is ok. Humans are flawed, no matter what social media tries to show.

Can anyone help me? I've been heavily reading on Stoicism for 6 months now so I think this is the best sub to seek advice. I'd like some thoughts or pointers to texts. Did Epictetus or M.A ever write anything similar to dealing with stuff like this?

When she said it to me, I felt hurt but didn't say anything. Right now she's visiting a friend's house so I'm alone right now as I type this. Right now I don't really feel sad or angry, just apathetic to the whole situation. I realize that what she said is out of my control and I should try to act virtuously. My question is how do I move forward from this? How do I do that virtuously? I'm not even sure that writing this post was a rational or emotional decision. Please help, thanks

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Thanks for all the comments, I had no idea this many people were so generous with their time, especially on a public site. I've read through all of them and I'll take that advice to heart.

For some context (and looking back at it), I don't believe my mother was 100% malicious towards me. My father is a good person, but he's a high functioning alcoholic and sometimes he can go too far with drinking, and that really makes my mom angry. My dad was actually going over to his friend's house (to drink) and my mom was going with him to watch over him, so they had an argument about it. A couple hours before that, I admit that I was giving her a little attitude over a disagreement, so she was already riled up with me. I think it was more of an outburst than anything. I also think my mother has some mental problems, my sister had depression so I think it may run in the family. My relationship with my mother is hard to describe. I don't feel like I have a true family (which is fine, I'm sure I'll find one later on), just 3 acquaintances living in the same house.  My sister is 25 and out of the house, but my relationship with her is also the same way.

To be honest I am quickly getting over the whole thing, but I feel somewhat guilty about it. I feel like I am expected to be more sad about it, but as of now I don't feel anything.

"Practice, practice, practice.","Hey you. Yeah you, the newcomer browsing this sub trying to figure out how to get started with Stoicism. You, the person who's going to post an ""OMG halp"" post. You, the person who's maybe read a Stoic book or two but is wondering how it applies to real life. This post is for you.

Stoicism is a fantastic philosophy that, when practiced correctly, can help you deal with any and all obstacles fate decides to put in your way. It doesn't matter what the hardship is, and that's the beauty of Stoicism; it can be used to deal with something as 'small' as a non-reciprocated high school crush or something as hard-hitting as the death of a loved one, financial ruin, or a global pandemic. In a Stoic's eyes, these are all the same thing. 

Stoicism is not some band-aid you slap on when you're feeling bad, though. In my mind it needs to be practiced as a preventative measure as well as a lifesaver in times of trouble. The more you practice it in the day to day when life is more or less going your way, the better it will serve you when defecation hits the oscillation. This is why, when someone asks ""how does a Stoic look at <bad thing>"" our answers can sound kinda cold and aloof: ""It doesn't matter."" ""Not worth thinking about."" ""Let it go and move on."". We can tell that you haven't put even a little effort into figuring it out for yourself.

So, how does one begin practicing Stoicism? Cold showers? Fasting? Sleeping on the ground? I mean, maybe, but I definitely understand how that can be a big turn-off for someone just beginning instruction. So I've outlined a few manageable things that anyone can start doing today, with no prior experience.

1) **Read.** My first suggestion will always be to get your education firsthand. Don't rely on some nice internet strangers to tell you what Stoicism is all about, get a good book(check the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/wiki/faq)) and dig in so you can begin to draw your own conclusions and custom fit it to your life. I like to recommend Epictetus's Enchiridion as a great starter. It's a relatively short read(was arranged to be a Handbook of Stoicism) but hella powerful. There is a free textfile [here](http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html) and a free audiobook [here](https://librivox.org/the-enchiridion-by-epictetus-tr-elizabeth-carter/). 

2) **Journal.** This can sound cheesy, but there's a reason we suggest it. One of the most important things you can learn to do is to reflect upon and analyze your own thought patterns and flow, and journaling, or a quiet time of reflection at the end of the day, helps loads with that. It doesn't have to be super structured, just a few notes stream-of-conscious style about how your day went, what upset you, why you think it upset you, what made you happy, why it made you happy, and so on. Then at the end of the week, read over what you wrote down and try to identify the externals that you give the most attention to. This, more often than not, will allow you to really focus on what areas you need to work on the most. *As a side benefit, if you are struggling with mental health issues, a journal is a fantastic tool for you and your therapist to use for your treatment.*

3) **Be present in the moment.** Living in the past leads to depression, living in the future leads to anxiety, living in the now leads to happiness. Easier said than done, I know, but one way is to try your best throughout the day to think and act intentionally. When you find yourself doing or thinking something, and you don't remember intentionally beginning that thought or action, retrace your steps/train of thought and try to find out how you got there. Don't go through the motions. 

Baby steps.

Stoicism is not some switch you flip and suddenly you're this invincible Stoic that nothing can harm. It takes time and practice. There are no ""masters"", no ""apprentices"", we are all Prokopton here. It's a journey, and we want to help you along it, but we can't take the steps for you because we're still taking them beside you.

Stoicism Rules for Life,"My husband shared this with me and I thought it was too good not to share.  I would love the author to get credit so please, if you know the source, mention it.

“When the standards have been set,” Epictetus said, “the work of philosophy is just this, to examine and uphold the standards, but the work of a truly good person is in using those standards when they know them.”

Define your rules. Live by them:

1. Focus on what you can control.

2. You control how you respond to things.

3. Ask yourself, “Is this essential?”

4. Meditate on your mortality every day.

5. Value time more than money and possessions.

6. You are the product of your habits.

7. Remember you have the power to have no opinion.

8. Own the morning.

9. Put yourself up for review. Interrogate yourself.

10. Don’t suffer imagined troubles.

11. Try to see the good in people.

12. Never be overheard complaining—even to yourself.

13. Two ears, one mouth for a reason.

14. There is always something you can do.

15. Don’t compare yourself to others.

16. Live as if you’ve died and come back (every minute is bonus time).

17. “The best revenge is not to be like that.” —Marcus Aurelius

18. Be strict with yourself and tolerant with others.

19. Put every impression, emotion, to the test before acting on it.

20. Learn something from everyone.

21. Focus on process, not outcomes.

22. Define what success means to you.

23. Find a way to love everything that happens.

24. Seek out challenges.

25. Don’t follow the mob.

26. Grab the “smooth handle.”

27. Every person is an opportunity for kindness.

28. Say no (a lot).

29. Don’t be afraid to ask for help.

30. Find one thing that makes you wiser every day.

31. What’s bad for the hive is bad for the bee.

32. Don’t judge other people.

33. Study the lives of the greats.

34. Forgive, forgive, forgive.

35. Make a little progress each day.

36. Journal.

37. Prepare for life’s inevitable setbacks.

38. Look for the poetry in ordinary things.

39. To do wrong to one, is to do wrong to yourself.

40. Always choose “alive time.”

41. Associate only with people that make you better.

42. If someone offends you, realize you are complicit in taking offense.

43. Fate behaves as she pleases…do not forget this.

44. Possessions are yours only in trust.

45. Don’t make your problems worse by bemoaning them.

46. Accept success without arrogance, handle failure with indifference.

47. Courage. Temperance. Justice. Wisdom. (Always).

48. The obstacle is the way.

49. Ego is the enemy.

50. Stillness is the key.

I’ll leave you with the one rule that captures all the rules. It comes from Epictetus: “Don’t explain your philosophy. Embody it.”

Marcus Aurelius reminded himself and now us, “Waste no more time talking about what a good man is like. Be one.”

* Emotions make you weak and we should repress them.
* Tough men are not ruled by emotions and to show them it is a sign of weakness.
* I should isolate myself.

None of them become any close of what Stoicism is about, so let me remind you why these are failures:

* If I make X things I will not feel BAD STUFF. But bad stuff will happen to you eventually and you will feel bad because of it, it is beyond your control to decide how the world acts upon you, Stoicism is not about controlling emotions, it is about learning to control ourselves despite our emotions and to distinguish which aspects of life we can control and which ones we can not and to learn to accept the later. If you guide yourself by avoidance then you may be sparing yourself some pain, but pain can be a teacher too, and if you skip class, you won't learn.
* Emotions make you weak and we should repress them. No, let me repeat this: NO! Emotions are part of our humanity, we don't get to choose which parts we want and which ones we do not, to have emotions is beyond our control as humans, and to repress them will only lead towards nothing good. A Stoic acknowledges such emotions as part of himself or herself, they are a natural component of humanity, which is something beyond our control, we can't help to be human, we were born like this. What a Stoic seeks is to not be dominated by emotions, because sometimes they cloud our judgement and lead to consequences that were not intended. There is also foolishness in thinking we can repress separate emotions and allow certain emotions to come, no, they are not separated items, it is more of a spectrum, you can't just block a part of it and pretend the parts you like to come freely and allow yourself to feel only that. A Stoic understands its emotions and learns from them, without allowing them to steer the ship that it is its self.
* Tough men are not ruled by emotions and to show them it is a sign of weakness. These kind of people live in a paradox where they don't want to be ruled by emotions because they don't want to be seen as week by other men because they fear what such display of weakness would bring upon them. These people live in fear, which is an emotion, therefore already defeated themselves without any effort. Again, Stoicism comprises not to deny our emotions but to separate them from our actions and our choices, and to understand what they bring to the table, think of them as an advisor which would suggest, without obligation, a course of action which you may choose or not depending on your own rational criteria.
* I should isolate myself. Why in the world would you do this? If you can't become your own island in a sea of people what makes you think you will make it when on your own? You would be building a sand sculpture of yourself only to watch it crumble as soon as the tide shifts. No, to be surrounded by people is part of our human existence, and we should seek to be our own refuge even when surrounded by terrible circunstances. If you need the world to be gone to be at peace with yourself then you can't achieve peace at all, because the world does not depends on you.

What else am I forgetting?

Oh yeah, simple guidelines:

1. Accept the world as it is and yourself as you are and not as you would like it or you to be.
2. Remember you are dying so try to not waste any opportunity.
3. It is what it is, once is out of your control there is no point in making yourself miserable.
4. The ship metaphor, again, if your existence would be a ship would you allow any emotion to steer it for you? Or would you take the wheel as captain and listen to your emotions for suggestion and then decide whether they are worth following or not?
5. The river metaphor, emotions flow like a river, if you build a dam to block the parts you don't want to collect water from the other side you won't get as much water as before, if you get anything at all.
6. Don't tell people to ""man up"" or to not feel, that's not healthy and that's not being Stoic.

What else am I forgetting?

"Just deleted my facebook and instagram account (1600 friends, 1089 followers)","I was watching a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6e1riShmak) on a facebook executive talking about the unintended negative consequences from apps like instagram and facebook. Apps where you broadcast your life in the most appealing way, and how that effects our society. While personally I feel like it doesn't effect me as much as perhaps a girl my age browsing instagram seeing girls with perfect bodies, and perfect boyfriends goin to their beach house and dining on the lake etc. I realized that slowly the things I began to desire were the things that were being cherry picked by people I know. I began to lose my identity and who I was, I was wasting time, and although instagram definitely had its merits, I could delete it and have the comfort of returning to it at any point. However, now that I have officially taken the steps to permanently delete my name, and account from both facebook and instagram, I feel like i have this enormous weight lifted off my shoulders, I feel like I am not burdened to maintain an image, but I can strive for what I want most in this world. I had some anxieties about it. Like what if something really incredible happened to me, like i got into med school, or get engaged or had a child. All these milestones in my life that others would not know about. But then I thought, what does it matter if people dont know I'm becoming a doctor or a lawyer, so long as I am actively helping others and fufilling my purpose in life, so what if people cant see that I am on a date with my gf, I have a beautiful person I get to spend my time with and have nothing else on my mind, so what if I get married and the only people who get to see the pictures are the people I invited to the wedding, thats how it should be, When I have a daughter so what if my extended friends i knew 7 years ago in highschool never get to see her, I will feel so much more gratified from the people who choose to come spend time with her.

If I die, or anybody I know dies, I will mourn them, but the amount of people that mourn me or my family members doesn't effect me. I don't need posts when I die. I am dead, and I spent my life being happy, and productive, and committed to my work and family, and not glued to other peoples perception of me, carefully curating my life for them.",Stoicism,1595724238.0,t3_hxxlm3,0.94,1057

A Stoic Answer to Toxic Masculinity:,"
I was having a discussion with a friend about my Stoic practice when my friend mentioned how Stoicism might feed into Toxic Masculinity, specifically the way my friend believed Stoicism and T.M. both advise people to overcome or suppress their emotions. 

Thankfully, it was clear this was an opportunity for me to remind myself that no one does or thinks wrong intentionally, and that every tension tension can be an opportunity to teach, learn, and grow. 

We continued talking, and I drew the distinction between being stoic and being Stoic. 

Then, I described the Stoic practice of identifying and examining the first movements of the soul, in order to better understand the roots of our passions, and to relate rationally and healthily to our emotions. 

It was then it hit me that Stoicism has been providing an answer for thousands of years to the type of lower-case stoicism prevalent in our culture. 

Practicing Stoics are intimately acquainted with their emotions. They can read their emotions the way seasoned mariners understand the cresting waves and the ebb and flow of the tides. 

So rather than feed into unhealthy emotional suppression found all too often in our young men (I see this among my high school students), a Stoic approach finds a way out by means of a way through. 

“The obstacle is the way”, as Marcus would put it. 

Thank you for reading,

Ross

Update: Thank you for the thoughtful responses and the awards! I was unaware how upsetting the term Toxic Masculinity would be for this group of Stoics. Given the way Stoics of the past like Cato the Younger and Marcus Aurelius were actively engaged in the political realm, I was under the impression politics were part of a Stoic’s engagement. We’re not Epicureans. 

Still, I’ll refrain from posting such terms in the future, but would encourage folks commenting on the existence or nonexistence of TM or those going on tangents about SJW to reread this post.

Observations by a dying stoic - part 3,"Sort of interesting how my perception of the limited time I have left is playing out. Even though I practiced visualing my death, it was always an abstract thing. I knew it would happen but lived as if it wouldn't until I was in my eighties. I have the family history for that, my parents are in their 80s and still mostly independent.

So now there is more focus on this as death approaches much sooner. My overall stoic practice has sharpened a bit but the real thing that changed most immediately was my view of physical things. A quote I read one time said that all you own will be found on the day of your death and belong to someone else. With that in mind making purchasing decisions has really tightened up. Before I would buy the best quality I could afford, now I usually pass on personal items all together.

I did go buy a new car for my wife. It's a practical vehicle but still very nice. Has a 10 year/125k mileage warranty and includes first 5 years of maintenance. I'm not going to exceed the warranty, but I wanted to make sure my wife was taken care of after I am gone. Without the diagnosis I would have made an entirely different and less practical choice.

So when another redditor asked if my diagnosis would change the way I lived, I rejected the idea thinking my stoic studies would continue as before. But now I have to say it really has. I weigh buying things against what I need to try to extend my life versus things I simply want. Not in a desperate rage against the dying of the light kind of thing but accepted by and still fighting. I would say my focus has tightened and I am humbled by the kindness and generosity of family and friends and even strangers, and no longer let that pass without acknowledging it.

Your parents get old. They die. So do your grandparents.

Your friends get married. You lose touch.

Your get old yourself.

**And what did you really spend your life doing?**

Look at the people on reddit. There is good, yes, but there's also endless argument, political or otherwise.

**Think about the absurdity of all this \*\*\*\* and how much we attribute meaning and importance to it. Or even random arguments we have on a daily/weekly basis, or the various strong emotions like petty anger or vengeance we seek to inflict on others, or the meaningless little goals we seek to fulfill.**

**We do all this...But we don't live in the moment. We don't see our mother, our father, get old, get frail, and before we know it, they die.** And then you wonder if you should maybe have lived in the moment and spent more time with them.

I know its maybe a common thought but it really hit me how you should savor the moment and how brief life is. I'm a millenial and feel old already. My parents are starting to look frail and death is smiling at them. My friends are looking old. Getting married or having kids.

I feel like I spent my 20s in meaningless arguments, meaningless angst, meaningless suffering. And its gone, I'm now 31.

**Don't you ever think about the modern capitalist world makes us feel like life is infinite due to the endless distractions and useless goals we are made to seek? The majority of us seem to live meaningless lives and we die at the end, bitter and wondering how the F it went by so fast.**

We're so caught up in our little egotistical quests that we don't realise we're supposed to live. Modern society has taken us so far from our animal nature (animals only live in the present) that we basically are incapable of savoring the moment and things like **memento mori** feel hollow until we see the face of our ageing parents or worse yet, their coffins.

How meaningless most of us are, how easily we waste our lives instead of living the most each day. Most of us wake up too late, on our deathbeds or crying as our parents and loved ones die.

If you are in this situation/mindset now, like I am, please change. Please make the most of tomorrow. Or you will cry of despair when you regret it later. **Focus on what truly matters.

"My grandfather is dying, and I admire my grandparents' reflection of it","I recently got the news that my grandfather's time is running out. He had always been a healthy man, and before this rapid decline in the past two years, he had never slept a night in a hospital bed. Last christmas was the first that I spent with my partner's family instead of my own, and instead of wallowing in useless guilt about imaginary ideas that I should have spent ""our last christmas"" with them, I called my grandmother today, and from now on will do so regularly.

 My grandparents have been married for over 65 years, and loved each other for the entire length of it. My grandmother told me that on the hospital bed as he was last taken in, he had smiled and told her that at least he'll be leaving a quite good-looking widow. While his memory and understanding of time and space are failing as well, his sense of humour is still very much there. They both know he is dying, and I was prepared to offer whatever little support or comfort I could.

Instead, she talked about what a good run they have had together. What a good age he had reached in perfect health, and how few people even do so. A beloved spouse she has spent her entire life with is dying, and she only calmly spoke about how good life has been, how grateful she is that it has lasted this long.

 My grandparents, who never had the time to read books or bother with such things as ""philosophy"", are true stoics, and I am glad and grateful that I have had the chance to know them at this age, when I've reached enough maturity to appreciate it.",Stoicism,1640696030.0,t3_rqf8f0,0.99,1033
Practicing Stoicism has practically cured my anxiety,"I used to be an overthinker. Now I'm just a thinker. 

For a long time I had no idea what the fuck was the matter with me. My brain was constantly racing with thoughts and most of them didn't benefit me at all. I'd think about my insecurities, relationships, people's opinions of me, and all the other stresses that come with work and being a young adult in world that seemed to change every time I blinked. 

And to be honest, I was also bit of a narcissist. Not in a way that I treated people poorly, but I was happy with the way I looked and above all I thought I was smart. Life was going well for me. Externally at least. I graduated college with a decent job (that actually ended up being a really shit job), and being well read meant that I could keep up with some of the older professionals that I was trying to impress. This provided other opportunities for me, and I began climbing the social pyramid. To the world I was progressing fast. Any accomplishment I made quickly lead to another. 

But with each accomplishment I felt more empty. Less of myself. For every positive thing in my life, I was overwhelmed by the potential negatives. Most of it it had to do with me losing whatever I had just gained. Other times it was as simple as fixating on something I hated about me, and not being able to get my brain to shut the fuck up about it. Waking up in the morning was a chore because it meant having to spend the entire day locked in my own head. It was as if I was the prisoner and the jail keeper. At the center of my despair was the inability to control any aspect of my mind. The irony is that me fighting for authority, ultimately granted me less of it. I was an experiencing a sensory overload every second of the day and wanted out of the game. And let me be the first to tell you that wanting ""out of the game"" will take you to some dark places. 

At some point, a lawyer who I had been working for suggested that I read Meditations by Marcus Aurelius because he thought it would be up my alley. I bought the wrong edition (Dover Swift), found it too dense, but then bought the Hayes edition and fell in love. 

Of course, it wasn't love at first site. Stoicism and I had an on-again, off-again relationship for a while where I would get really into it and then drop it for months. Then about three years ago, I hit a point mentally where I realized something had to give. I decided to commit to philosophy and all of the practices involved. Let me be the first to tell you that being a stoic transformed my life. 

Currently I'm about 80% stoic in terms of my personal philosophy, but that 80% is the best part of the meal. Putting into practice ideas like focusing what's in your control, adjusting to circumstances without stressing over them, attempting to be a person with admirable character, and overall embodying the philosophy we express that we believe in has cured me of so many of the anxieties that used to haunt me.

Nothings fun anymore. Ice cold reality it feels like. This change in reality for me is mentally exhausting right now. Any stoic advice or letters about personal development and the sacrifice that comes with it?

EDIT: I no longer have stuff to do to numb the pain with. Being aware of all this is a very harsh and also the reason I'm suffering from it. I can't use the internet, weed or literally anything else to escape anymore, because I know that's exactly what I did.

I have this empty space I can’t fill. I do everything I can to help myself in this situation. I see my therapist once a week. Turned my bedroom into home fitness because of lockdown.

"Tip: You may not be able to choose what thoughts you have, but you can very often choose what thoughts you -finish.-","Very often the negative thoughts we have fit into a script, they're things we tell ourselves that we know will be especially painful, or push our buttons, or whatever.  ""I am the worst person in the world,"" thought several hundred million people, word for word verbatim.   
  
So, with that bit of knowledge in mind, here's what you can do to help address negative ruminations: You can stop them in their tracks.  Ctrl+Alt+Delete their ass on the first word, and it's both pretty simple and pretty easy to do, if you know how, so here's how:  
  
**STEP 1:** Identify your script.  
  
 * You know what you tell yourself, you know the exact words, the exact sentences, you know them by heart, we all do.  It's always the same thing, rarely if ever does it vary.  Figure out the actual words, that's your starting point.  
  
**STEP 2:** Recognize the thought.  
  
 * Learn to recognize the whole thought from the first word, though you probably already do.  When my brain says ""I'm,"" I already know that ""The worst person in the world."" is what comes next, always, invariably.  ""Nobody,"" and then comes ""Could possibly love me.""  ""Everybody,"" is followed by ""Hates me.""  Learn to recognize these thoughts as soon as they pop up.  
  
**STEP 3:** Interrupt the thought.  
  
 * Easier said than done, right?  Actually no.  Recognizing what's coming allows you to step in and redirect your attention.  The human brain can't think two thoughts at once, we can think two thoughts very very closely together, but not at once.  When you recognize the thought you can choose to think something else, but it *is* a choice.  I use the ^*""NOPE!""* technique, and it works exceptionally well, as soon as you see the first word, the first sign of a negative thought, interrupt it with a ^*""NOPE!""* and move on to something else.  It sounds too easy to work, but it absolutely can work.  
  
An example:  
  
 1. Identify script: ""I'm the worst person in the world.""  
 2. Recognize the thought: ""I'm,"" is followed by ""the worst person in the world.""  
 3. Interrupt the thought: *""I'm ^NOPE!! ~~the worst person in the world.""~~*  

Important disclaimer: If you're anything like me you might find yourself running at sixty nopes per second at first as your depression fights back, but stick to it, give it a real chance, it's gonna' be a fight for a while, but it's one I believe you *can* win.
  
Recognizing the thought gives you a moment, a beat, an opportunity to move your attention elsewhere (or do anything else with that moment that you care to, for that matter.)  
  
I don't know if it's necessary, but I'd strongly encourage you to pick something dismissive, I chose *NOPE!* because it's got that fed-up-and-fuck-you tone that I want to respond to my negative thoughts with, ""Nah."" would also work, or ""lol,"" whatever, something that drains the thought of its power.  Though here in /r/Stoicism/ a strong and solid ""No."" might be the best choice.  
  
There you go, everything you need to know, you can nope right out of those thoughts if you want to, just because you start them doesn't mean you have to finish them.  
  
---  
  
We tend to respect our negative thoughts, they come to us in our own voice, and we presume, logically, that they're trying to help us in some way.  ""Maybe if I call myself a stupid piece of shit for not taking out the trash I'll remember to take out the trash next time.""  It's about as effective as breaking your own ankle in hopes that the punishment will improve your awful mile time: Sounds good, doesn't work.  If you've got depression or negative thinking patterns, those thoughts aren't out to help you, they're out to hurt you, that's their goal, their purpose, their *intent,* so why listen to that?  If you know that Dave (in accounting) hates your guts with a passion, then why should you believe him when he says you look like crap?  Why should you even listen to him?  Why not hear his voice and choose instead to think about how damn fine you look today?  
  
You don't have to *listen* to your own thoughts.  
You don't have to *respect* your own thoughts.  
You don't have to *finish* your own thoughts.  
  
Just because it exists doesn't mean it has value to you, doesn't mean it helps you in any way, and if these thoughts don't help you in any way (or anyone else for that matter) when why bother listening to them, why give *them* value when they don't give *you* value?  
  

Also, and importantly, I don't want this to be a ""Wow, thanks, I'm cured."" sort of post.  You can't nope away bipolar disorder or clinical depression, this isn't a cure, it's to help you *cope.*  Please, please, *please* don't stop going to therapy or taking your medications because of a reddit post, okay?  This is *a* tool for your *toolbox,* it is meant to be an addition, a supplement, not a replacement.  It works well, but much like *just* doing sit ups at the gym, it's not everything you'll need to be healthy.

Strangely enough, I felt pretty fine. I did want to get it done with, but, I felt alright.

"Stoicism is a ""Dull"" Philosophy","On multiple occasions people have told me how Stoicism is a ""dull"" or weak philosophy. How the Stoics didn't push the envelope when it came to intellectual ideas. Therefore, their work isn't anything special.

When I hear this, it reveals to me they don't understand it's purpose or place.

The Stoics were not interested in pushing the envelope of the bleeding edge of ideas, they were interested in realizing and embodying the highest good;  quelching the fear of death, being honest and virtuous. They weren't interested in mastering debate with others, they were busy mastering the disharmony in themselves. They didn't need to feel superior by holding new and fantastic ideas over other, they were content with little, and needed only their virtue for their pride, honor, and self-worth.

They didn't hold themselves back from new philosophy, nor did they suggest Stoicism was the highest or best philosophy. It's really less of a philosophy, in the sense most people approach it, and more of a reliable and sturdy tool / vehicle to keep the soul and mind free and clear from unnecessary chaos.

Don’t constantly crave happiness,"If you’re not happy right now, that’s okay. If you’re sad, you can be sad.

Don’t feel pressure to be anything. This is the lesson I struggle with. I find myself being critical of my choices, appearance, emotions, position. I want change in so many areas and I work really hard to make that happen. 

You may know that this is called Hedonic Adaption. It’s a brilliant system for growth over the long term, but in the moment it feels like pressure. And the more pressure you have to change things, the more you’ll feel stressed. 

You achieve something new and before you know it you’re back to craving more. It’s like being hungry all the time. What you crave changes hour by hour, but the craving persists. Can you keep the drive to do stuff, and feel less stressed?

I think so. There are many tools, but two which have helped me are Meditation and Gratitude. 

Meditation hones your skill of noticing what’s happening. It’s crazy to think we need help with this, but evidence suggests that our mind wanders all the time. And without knowing what’s happening right now, more and more, its a lot harder to take action. 

Gratitude acts directly against hedonic craving. If you’re happier with what you have, your mind won’t bother as much about what you don’t. 

There’s already so much info out there about these two things, but a regular daily practice is the only thing that works for me. 

That’s what I’m trying to focus on during these difficult times. And the worries I had about less productivity and purpose is faulty thinking. It’s bullshit created by a mind addicted to always having more. I am instead calmer and less stressed, which gives me more energy to do the things I want to do.",Stoicism,1591273000.0,t3_gwgbxt,0.99,1023

I just had a moment where it clicked.,"3,5 years ago I was introduced to stoicism in my philosophy class, just the basic ""who is who"" and where it originated from. I digested the basic thoughts of the philosophy but didn't dig deeper. 

Since last summer, I began researching it again and reading books. On christmas this year, my girlfriends parents gifted me ""The Daily Stoic"" by Ryan Holiday and I began establishing my daily routine of reading a page a day, meditating and journaling. 

Yesterday, on day 8, there was this quote: 

>We must give up many things to which we are addicted, considering them to be good. Otherwise, courage will vanish, which should continually test itself. Greatness of soul will be lost, which can't stand out unless it disdains as petty what the mob regards as most desirable. -Seneca, *Moral Letters*, 74.12b-13

I use the journaling app ""stoic."" too and during my morning routine a quote by Siddharta Gautama, which was about how wins and losses, praise and guilt, pleasure and grief come and go. To be happy, we have to be rooted between all of that like a tree. 

I then began staring at the ceiling and thinking about why I am so sad when I think about past relationships. I never got to the end before, I mean, I have a happy relationship with my current girlfriend and long for nothing, really. So why was it then, that I'm so sad of the past? 

Then it began to hit me, that I always invested everything of myself in these relationships. Like an addiction, I was addicted to the feelings, whether they were good or bad. I began to understand that the reason I never got over my past relationships was because I gave so much of myself, that when they failed I clung to the sad feelings instead of accepting what is not in my control and gain clarity of the addiction I had to these people. 

After that realization I started to meditate and I never meditated so good that I felt completely free and ecstatic, as if I could fly. It just all made click.",Stoicism,1610201068.0,t3_ktrgiy,0.99,1014
Don't expect people to notice the positive changes you're making,"*""It's quite possible to be a good man without anyone realizing it. Remember that."" - Marcus Aurelius 7.67*

The path to self-improvement is a rigorous journey. It demands so much of us. Practicing stoicism is no different from learning anything else. It calls for dedication, and requires us to put ourselves under a microscope and dissect our own insecurities and shortcomings with objectivity and precision. It is an internal journey, and yet our instincts can lead us to seek external approval for our efforts. 

Unless the difference is night and day, do not expect anyone to notice the ways in which you've improved yourself. Whether your learning to deal with your anxiety, climbing out of paralyzing depression, or even coping with feelings of existential dread and are just starting to see the light. Do not expect your neighbor to notice. We do not need their validation to validate our progress. 

Why did you start this campaign to be better in the first place? Was it to curry favor with those around you or was it to live a better life with a healthier perspective on the world around us?

With that said, I have this nagging feeling that my life is a wasted one from the very first breath I have taken and over the recent years, I have been seeing more and more instances of my life being worthless and without value, despite being firm on the Stoic values and taking the necessary steps to fight the suicidal thoughts: therapy, meds, reading, sports, talking to other people, and nothing works.

Worst part is, the slightest rejection by another person, especially a woman I might be romantically interested in, becomes an emotional pain that is so agonizingly debilitating that the suicidal thoughts pop-up on their own every time, as the ""ultimate solution"" to not hurt anymore.

I don't know how to deal with this anymore. I already have so very few opportunities with women in my life (given that they are all taken already and those that aren't don't want *me* for a long term relationship) and the ones I get turn sour almost immediately.

I woke up today! Momento Mori.,"I've studied stoicism for several years. I struggle on a daily basis to work my learnings into every day life. My emotions, desires, biases, and perceptions control me on a daily basis.

That being said, my two year old son gave me passionate reminder of 'memento mori.'

I was up early, doing some writing and drinking coffee. All in all a good morning.

I hear my son get out of bed. I check my phone... he is up a little early. I'm a little annoyed that my free time is cut short, but I wasn't enjoying what I was working on anyway.

Oliver, my son, walks around the corner. He shows no signs of sleep in his eyes, but his hair is sticking out in every direction. He still walks with the clumsiness of a toddler, but Oliver doesn't let that slow him down. He spreads his arms wide and beams a smile at me.

""I woke up today!"" he shouted, joy clinging to every word.

It was pure celebration. He was announcing it to the world. 

It was passionate enough to give me pause and stir my thoughts. I didn't know what to say. My tiny terror, my little man, had just embodied momento mori in such a pure, innocent way. What could I possibly say that would match his enthusiasm and profound insight? What could I say that would show him that my happiness matched his own?

""That is awesome!"" I said back, spreading my arms. We hugged, and I held him for as long as he would allow. 

You woke up today, and that is awesome.

Edit - I have made a spelling error! I originally had momento instead of memento!

Another edit - my garbage spelling aside - when he came out and said that, my first thought was ""was not waking up even an possibility?"" As I thought through it, I came to the conclusion that of course it was a possibility! Either of us could've died in our sleep. It happens every day. It seemed a little too morbid to include in the original post, but here we are.

I shivered at the thought, but it was all too real at that point.  

So, my son's celebration of life served as a reminder that we will all die, often at a time we do not expect.

Stoics! It’s the start of the week so these are some advices I hope will make this week great for you!,"1.) when you wake up, remind yourself that whatever may happen today is because it is part of our fate and let it not control our emotions and live in what is now.
2.) when you start feeling emotions like anger, sadness, jealousy and other negative feelings. Let them go. Focus on what you can control and don’t let your emotions control you.
3.) learn to love “what is”. 
4.) practice the banquet of life: when it comes your way, enjoy it. When that time is done with you, then let it pass. You had your time. 
5.) practice your strength which is the ability of holding oneself. 
6.) circumstances have no care for your feelings.
7.) you don’t always have to have an opinion. Sometimes it’s better to say “I don’t know” than get into an argument. 
8.) in the evening, reflect about your day. Reflect on your emotions and feelings.
9.) journal, journal and JOURNAL!! It’s a great way for future reflections and see how you’ve grown as a person.
10.) ENJOY YOUR WEEK!!! Be happy. Enjoy and good luck with this week everyone!

"For me Stoicism isn't about controlling your feelings, it's about controlling your actions.","Not sure if my personal take on Stoicism is 100% aligned with the dogma, but frankly I don't really care as I don't see Stoicism as a dogmatic religion. For me Stoicism is a tool to help me live a better life.

I see so many posts here about people trying to control their feelings with Stoicism. People feel bad or angry and are looking for help with these emotions. I also see lots of posts of people saying they used Stoicism to feel calm or sanguine in a stressful situation. For me these types of posts miss the point.

For me, Stoicism is about optimizing your actions. It's about keeping focused on ""Right Action"" in the face of adversity (and everyday life). It's about taking the best actions and best steps to improve your life regardless of what's going on. I don't think you should or even can ""not feel bad"" when shit happens. Bad stuff definitely happens and it will make you feel bad feelings. You will see your friends and family die. You will get sick and die yourself. You will get cut off in traffic. You will make some very bad decisions that you regret. This is life. For me the point here is not to get so caught up in the pain of those bad things that you don't move forward and take the best right actions you can to improve your life ahead. More simply it's not ""Think Positive"" it's ""Take Positive Action"".

Speaking from personal experience, I was diagnosed with Stage 4 colon cancer at age 42. It definitely made me scared, sad, angry, etc. Stoicism has helped me do my best to focus my actions on anything and everything that I can do to try to improve my odds of survival and live my best life in the meantime. I worked to find the best doctors I could, did everything they advised, took my medicine and got the chemo, radiation, surgery, etc as fast as possible. I did my best to eat stuff that could help and avoid stuff that might not help. I get as much exercise as possible. It's been 3 years and I've been in complete remission for over 2. Docs are optimistic I'm likely fully ""cured"" and could even live a normal lifespan -- but no guarantees for sure and the next few years are still rather uncertain. 

Stoicism definitely didn't directly help me feel good or not bad - BUT - it did give me something to focus on and the idea of ""Right Action"" felt like a lifeline for me. Going through that was difficult but somehow the best thing that's ever happened to me (especially if I do really get fully cured). It's given me much more perspective so just thought I'd share.

The universe owes you *nothing*,"Isn’t it interesting that we all wake up every day with the feeling that this day is owed to us?

And how much human emotional suffering can be attributed to this idea of being owed things just because you currently exist? Constantly operating with the belief that you deserve certain things (aside from basic human rights) inevitably sets your mind up for disappointment, sadness and suffering.

"If you never ask yourself why you feel something, you will always be susceptible to those feelings.","Hey all,

So a ton of posts on here are about ""How can I not feel bad about XYZ"". And for the most part, these questions (and their answers) are looking at things from a point of view of ""How can I not externalise this emotion"" which can be useful on the short-term for navigating specific situations or going about your day less impeded by an emotion but this is Stoicly painting over the cracks.

Yes, we consider it good to control your own reactions but how stoic is this actually? If someone externally behaves 'properly' but is internally dominated by their emotions then what's been achieved that stoicism would call good? Nothing really... Not only are we going to be less capable than our potential for anything we commit ourselves to, but it's not sustainable and will come tumbling down eventually.

Instead, a pivotal practice and reflection is to ask yourself **why** you feel a certain way. Understand what about you as a person, your personality, your views, and your beliefs etc. cause certain events in reality to elicit emotional responses within you.

If you are elated by something - What about you values that external thing so highly? 

If you are angered by something - What about you holds that external thing to be so harmful? 

When you can identify and understand what part of you links an event to a response, then you can actually do something about it. We don't get harmed by insults about appearance because appearance or insulting is naturally ""bad"" rather we get insulted because some part of us harbours insecurities or pride about our appearance. If we work to remove the insecurity and the pride, we remove the ability to be harmed by insults.

Yes, you can choose to ignore the angery that happens if someone insults you... But that anger will happen every time if you don't break the connection, and that person will still have power over your mind no matter how you externalise it.

It's not stoic to walk away from a situation going ""Man, I acted so stoicly, I didn't let my anger get me... I could have said so much back to them but I walked away"". If it truly didn't affect you, you wouldn't be thinking about how you had to control an external response.",Stoicism,1654505333.0,t3_v5yc8m,0.99,991

Our relatives (strict religious people) didn’t know we were gay, just thought we were best friends. We hadn’t told our friends we were dating either. At the time we thought it was best to not tell anybody until we were both financially independent, but now nobody knows how much pain I’m in right now. I was gonna propose as soon as we graduated next fall.

I’m trying to be stoic through this. I know I provided him with love and support, and improved his quality of life (he struggled with depression his whole life). I know I did all I could for him. Today I brought flowers to a hiking trail we used to go on all the time. I said my goodbyes and that I would love him forever. 

But I still feel so empty. I burst into tears constantly which is unusual for me, though expected I guess. Everything reminds me of him. I haven’t gotten out of bed for more than a few minutes or showered in days. I have a hard time finding any reason to live. I want this impossibly horrible wave of grief and depression to go away. I’d rather feel numb than feel like this.",Stoicism,1589847436.0,t3_gmdrk5,0.97,998
"Nothing will just ""work out""","I'm not a religious person. But i fell victim to this mindset that a lot of people have. That somehow things will work out just because.

I took a psychology class a while ago, and i remember learning something very interesting. I can't remember its exact name, but it was that a lot of people have this fairy tale mindset, that they're somehow special, that things will work out, that they will get a happy ending. 

Its harsh, but thats completely false. Not every struggle that comes your way is accompanied by some blessing. Life is rough and at the end of the day, there is no rhyme or reason behind what life will throw your way. My point being, whatever you want, you have to put in the effort to achieve, don't wait for it. 

I learned this the hard way. I made a lot of mistakes in my past, thinking things would work out magically in the end, because i somehow special from the other 7 billion humans on this earth. And i learned the hard way when things didn't pan out the way i thought they would. 

in my opinion, screw destiny, fate, or whatever. Your life is in your hands.",Stoicism,1616532490.0,t3_mboffq,0.95,994

A nice passage from Marcus Aurelius on handling criticism,"Read this today and it really resonated with me so wanted to share:

If an action or utterance is appropriate, then it’s appropriate for you. Don’t be put off by other people’s comments and criticism. If it’s right to say or do it, then it’s the right thing for you to do or say.

The others obey their own lead, follow their own impulses. Don’t be distracted. Keep walking. Follow your own nature, and follow Nature - along the road they share.

"When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly.

They are like this because they can’t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own—not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural.

A quote by Richard Dawkins," ""We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Sahara. Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively exceeds the set of actual people. In the teeth of those stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here. We privileged few, who won the lottery of birth against all odds, how dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state from which the vast majority have never stirred?""

I can be stoic. Today I stood my ground against an angry neighbor who threatened to punch me in the face.,"I actually, genuinely wasn't afraid. I knew him enough to know that if it comes to it, it won't be more than that punch which will heal. Also knowing it will be easy to get injury compensation from him helped that. As a side note: I didn't actively provoke him. He just can't stand me not assuming a position under him.  
I introduced the post with the statement I could be stoic when needed. So why do I want to kill myself? The past weeks I regularly thought it would make sense for me to cease existing. I am not prepared for all that life will throw at me. At the mere hint of stress my thoughts go back to drugs. I'm 25 and could never get an apprenticeship like 90% of people my age. Everyone says I'm so clever but this cleverness has done me nothing good so far. I am not cut out for what I will need to overcome to get a better life. Opening myself up to people, leading discussions, convincing someone of my person. I don't make an impression on anyone. I am forgettable.  
Please tell me what should be truly important in life for someone that has already picked up and applied stoic ideas. Tell me that all that society expects from is not important and inject some philosophy into my mind. I will absorb anything as I believe in stoicism and philosophy.

Hapiness is not a thing or a person. Happiness it is a choice that exists within us and Stoicism can help us realize it.,"I’m not sure why people believe Stoics to be emotionless but I find a lot of joy as a result of practicing it. I smile a lot more and am grateful for the things I have around me and no longer take them for granted. I think people have a misconception of happiness, that it’s some state of being in a constant high, (which i’ve experienced from doing drugs and buying material things. but i’ve learned pleasure is fleeting and the higher you climb the harder you drop). I’m close to one year in quarentine. When it started I felt I hit rock bottom, but now I feel like I’m living the dream. Guess what, nothing has changed much around me (people have actuallly grown more restless and stressed), the only thing that’s changed is my mindset. 

I definitely have my ups and downs and doubts like every human being, but practicing Stoicism has helped me to rebalance faster after each turbulance. For example, rejections from people and jobs sting (Im glad they sting bc it reminds me im human and not a robot), but after that sting I try to rationalize what’s occured. Did i do my best? I think i did, and thats enough, most of it was out of my control anyways. On to the next person or oppritunity. 

To be honest I feel a lot more free now and can now spend all this headspace filling it with more knowledge and trying to make the world around me a better place—another great thing I love about Stoicism. To me it seems pretty altruisitic bc one has a duty to others. It makes sense. I look to the natural world for inspriation. The bees do the duty of the bees and do it well. The trees do the duty of the trees and do it well. As a human being, I have several duties, and now I must learn to do them well.",Stoicism,1614188914.0,t3_lris2c,0.98,960

"Wake Up, Short Post On a Our Tragic Situation","News, social media, porn, YouTube, Netflix and overconsumption has stripped us of our ability to sustain attention, to feel deeply, and to connect to one another. It's 2020 and the world is swept away, more and more people, younger and younger, are being pulled into distraction-based-existence (DBE).

When the situation is seen for what it is, it’s heartbreaking. Anxiety, fear, anger, unrest are normalized. Men trapped in porn addiction, women trapped in image complexes, children having full blown addictions to screens. YouTube, Tik Tok and similar software companies, pay millions (probably way more) in research to entrap & sustain human awareness for *as long as possible*. And they succeed. For the sake of what? Profit.

If you love yourself; set your standards higher. And I mean *much* higher. Your society won't set them higher for you, your friends & family likely won't either. You have to do it for yourself, especially if you want to help others.

This is what I mean by ""*much* higher"":

Peace of Mind:

If you’re not completely peaceful in being alone, raise your standard. When I say peaceful, I truly mean peaceful. Most people may not even understand this. I'll elaborate.

You are content, you are not thinking of the past, or concerned about the future. In fact, you decide when you want to think, on your terms. Your thoughts aren’t randomly dragging you through the mud of fear, anxiety, worry. You direct your thoughts, and can simply stop cycles of thought when you wish.

This is unfathomable to most in society, yes, because it’s not their standard. Don’t follow their standard. Stop accepting the constant assault from your mind. If you love yourself, you’ll make this a priority. Train it. You’re gonna live in the mind for the rest of your life, maybe clean it up, especially before pointing out the mess in others.

Joy in Being:

Remember when you were a child, when you were just happy and engaged in the world for the sake of it? If you love yourself, make that your standard. You believe you lost that childlike wonder and joy, you haven’t, it’s there, trust me, you’ve just allowed your mind to turn into a dumping ground with the collective baggage. It isn’t even your fault, necessarily, don’t be so quick to blame yourself. Those around us simply do what they’ve learned from their society, family, and friends and teach us the best they’ve come up with to be happy. Unfortunately, the best they’ve come up with isn’t close to acceptable if you want stable joy.

You find joy in your work. In creating a beautiful future. You share this with others, and they recognize this rare quality in you. This is necessary if you want to be exceptionally helpful to those confused and in pain around you. The best way to help others is to first learn to help yourself.

Groundedness:

Your possessions will break. You will see friends / family die. Your body will fail you. You will find yourself tested over and over and over by life’s difficulties. But you learn to stay rooted in a stable ship of peace. Even when all the above happen, you’ll be able to support those in less stable minds. You can support your family when there is a death. You become a pillar in society by being a noble example.

This isn’t a somber acceptance of the harshness of reality, but the result of honest reflection of how things are. When the nature of reality is seen for what it is, you recognize the immaturity of engaging in war against it.

You learn to let experiences come and go. They’d do that regardless, and you know this. This is not a cold state, it is a wise state. It’s a mature state. It’s the only state that is aligned with the flow of reality. And when you do this, you begin to realize the value was never in the passing world anyway, it was something deeper within the whole time.

It’s time to wake up, you’re ready when you say you are, stop waiting to say you are. The standard of society, social media, friends, family, is not enough. Give yourself a chance to be peaceful, joyful, grounded. You’re mind isn’t a dumping ground, treat it like the most valuable tool you have and you’ll find that it is. This will be the best decision you make in your life.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading and here's a final post script... Message me if you’d like to join a group that will be a support structure for those sincere & serious about this. I want to do my part in providing a tangible means to assist in such difficult times for those ready. Thanks.",Stoicism,1590989283.0,t3_guen27,0.97,948

My cat of 17 years died today,"We got him when I was a child. Now he leaves as I head off to grad school. I was his chosen human, so to speak, and I'm immensely grateful to have been that.

I was the only one home who could have brought him to the emergency vet, but I wouldn't have been able to live with myself had I let someone else go in my place once we got the call that he would need to be put to sleep. I couldn't bear the thought of someone else he wasn't as comfortable being with him at the end, nor him being put down alone, amongst strangers in a place he hated and was confused by.

Tears wouldn't stop emerging. I spent half an hour comforting him and petting him, trying to make him feel a bit more comfortable and secure. I held him in my arms at the end, and I heard him purring before the sedative kicked in. I hope he felt safe and loved, and I'm glad he's not suffering anymore.

The only reason I post this here is because I'm grateful for Stoicism in helping me through this. When I was younger, our dog died, and I was too emotional to even go with her to the vet. I always regretted that, though I don't hold it against myself anymore. Practicing Stoicism has helped me actualize doing what I know must be done. I had recognized when he became sick that it was a likely event. I rationalized myself through it and, though I was immensely sad, I kept my mind clear and worked toward getting him the help he needed. I had already come to terms with it. I had the strength to be there for him, to help him through the end of his life.

He was a constant companion and a close friend, always at my side. [And he was quite the stoic himself.](https://i.imgur.com/GwKwcFb.jpg)

It finally clicked for me today that I can't control other people's emotional suffering. I can only choose my own actions.,"Today I had a brief interaction with a man that seemed to be experiencing feelings of resentment and bitterness towards women. He was my barista at Starbucks and it was basically impossible to say anything to help him feel better while ordering coffee. In the past I would have felt like I should have somehow helped but that I failed.

But after this interaction, it dawned on me that I cannot control other people's suffering. Doing good does not mean I am responsible for reducing other people's experiences of suffering. I must focus on choosing my own good actions and letting go of the rest.

I thought that being virtuous meant being for others the person no one was for me in my time of need. I used to feel a special responsibility towards these kinds of bitter men because I am a woman. I used to see my responsibility to act virtuously as a responsibility to alleviate suffering in others.

But that way of thinking is wrong. I can't control other people's suffering. I can only demonstrate the kind of person I am by choosing my actions. I have to accept that sometimes people will suffer no matter how good a person I am. I cannot control their feelings. I can only control my own actions and live with integrity.",Stoicism,1620359389.0,t3_n6pmq9,0.99,950

You're Owed Nothing,"We embark in this journey of self-development and we feel the sweet feeling of a fresh beginning, fresh opportunities waiting to come. We grind day in and day out. We have a fucking blast putting ourselves under pressure.

But there is a problem.

We become entitled.

We think that, because of our work, we deserve things. We think that because of our effort, we should receive something, be it money or a certain type of treatment. Put simply, we establish a covert contract with life: ""If I do x, life will give me the y I want"", and we operate with that lens.

And we get fucked over. And rightly so.

In no way are you guaranteed or owed results because of your effort. There are simply the mechanics of life: you do certain things that increase the likelihood of you reaching your desired outcome and others that push you away from it. You can do everything that diminishes the chances of you getting what you want and still get it, whilst in some other domain the opposite might occur.

Understand this: the process of going from goal to goal and seeing yourself develop skills throughout your life is the joy. The getting or not is just the frosting of the cake: it makes everything better still, but you're good either way. If you go through life with unspoken expectations put over it, you'll suffer. And you thinking that if you do x, then you deserve y is an expectation. A dangerous one. You'll live angry, frustrated at life.

Don't get me wrong, you can have desires and you can do things in order to have certain results. But be careful not to feel like you deserve those results, just because you worked. Feeling like you deserve stuff is one way in which you throw your judgements into reality. And the things you add to reality are not part of it. Always remember:

>“If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.” *―* ***Marcus Aurelius,*** *Meditations*

"Very stoic passage from ""How To Win Friends and Influence People"" by Dale Carnegie","""Everybody in the world is seeking happiness—and there is one sure way to find it. That is by controlling your thoughts. Happiness doesn’t depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner conditions.
It isn’t what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about it. For example, two people may be in the same place, doing the same thing; both may have about an equal amount of money and prestige—and yet one may be miserable and the other happy. Why? Because of a different mental attitude. I have seen just as many happy faces among the poor peasants toiling with their primitive tools in the devastating heat of the tropics as I have seen in air-conditioned offices in New York, Chicago or Los Angeles.

Don’t Carry the Mountains You’ve Climbed,"One of my professors for one of my first engineering courses felt it was necessary to educate my class on the two types of fun. The first fun is straight up fun. The ice-cream for dinner kind of fun; the kind of fun that is fun from start to end but doesn’t stick around once it’s over. So it’s best enjoyed while one has it as it might never materialize as a defining memory in one’s identity. And then there’s the second.

The second kind of fun must be endured. It’s all journey and no destination for longer than we may like it. It’s breaking one’s leg and continuing to hike up the mountain because the view is worth it. But man, is that view really something! Based on the grin on my professor’s face, I didn’t need clarification which type of fun the class would be.

In life, everyone constantly hikes up figurative mountains whether they want to or not. Everyone isn’t just hiking up one mountain at a time either, but they’re actually scaling multiple at once and each mountain differs greatly. Some mountains have dense jungles with mosquitos the size of your fist that suck one’s energy. Some are barren rock without cover from the scorching sun that progressively gets more painful the longer one’s on it. Some mountains are blanketed in snow that not only slows us down, making the summit feel distant, but because fresh snow falls on our foot prints, we can’t even back trace. And then some mountains have an oasis on their peaks with delicious fruit, but as we are ejecting the contents of our stomach we realize the cloud that obscured the true height of the mountain has disappeared, and we must now continue our expedition with food poisoning.

While there are two types of fun, there are an infinite number of unique mountains. Unfortunately, if we don’t turn around at any point while scaling the mountain, type two fun will never feel fun. If we only focus on our hardships instead of the beauty in the process, we surrender any reward we could have gained.

A reality for many is that they are unable to get off the mountain even after they’ve successfully reached its end. Not because they are in awe of the view, but because they let the obstacles they face torture their souls. Face down in the dirt, these people carry the weight of the mountains themselves on their brittle bones leading to suffocation and depression.

Thankfully, these people can be saved – I know because I was one of them at one point in my life.

In college, my mountains were mostly career and dating-life related. They were filled with lonely days and sleepless nights until finally the giant boulder that blocked my path to the top of the mountain slid off the mountain face on one stormy night that I thought would bury me in mud. I’m not sure I can give specific strategies for a successful summit for every mountain, but mountains are guaranteed to change while we traverse them. Patience is the most valuable tool one can put in one’s hiking backpack besides sunscreen to ensure one gets a profile picture worthy view.

More recently, I burned myself out at a job I had for just under a year. It was an all-consuming expedition up a mountain that actually turned out to be a volcano after it exploded, and left me searching for not just a new job but a new identity. Unable to see past the ash cloud that blocked the view and unable to get to the higher ground due to the molten lava expunging from the crater at the top, I was defeated.

My friends and family all assured me I would succeed as I would have in the past, but I had serious doubts. I felt like an imposter who reached the summits of my previous mountains not through skill, but luck. I went to open my backpack to see what tools I had been using and only saw bubble wrap and glitter that served no purpose other than take up space and make a mess. Game over.

Months went by and while the ash cloud lingered, the lava hardened into obsidian, forming impenetrable walls that I could still not scale. I would never get to see a product I engineered be brought to market while working with my team.

Descending the volcano, I reached the trail head and noticed an adjacent path – a fork in the road so to speak. Soon the scorched earth at the base transitioned to lush foliage as I gained elevation. The creatures I encountered were incredibly friendly and once I learned they quite enjoyed eating glitter, they let me ride them to the top. Hopping off my valiant-but-figurative beast of burden, I came to the top of a waterfall. Unrolling my bubble wrap, I sat atop the improvised floatation device and made my way to the edge. The fury of the water crashing against the rocks at the bottom of the mountain pushed the ashy cloud out of view and I could finally see: what it’s like to lead development for a product being brought to market.

I can’t say we always make the best decisions on the trail or that we can summit all mountains. And I can’t say that we will always get to see the view from the top.

But I can say that if we remain patient with ourselves to not give up, we have the best chance of getting to the top. And if we forgive ourselves when we can go no further due to depression, anger, grief, and guilt we leave the weight of the mountain at the trailhead. And finally, if we stay willing to keep climbing new mountains, we will live a beautiful life.

5) Accept the fact that humanity has lost its way, and you’re going to deal with incompetent people on a daily basis

Being that we are all fallible we all play the villains in others' stories at some point. When I do find myself in such a role or noticing my own villains, I get annoyed. Whether I like it or not I will meet and will personally be challenging to others.

“No expert needs validation from an amateur.” — Epictetus,"This Epictetus says in Book 2 of Discourses, chapter 13 titled ‘On nerves’.

And I think this is so profound because often the reason behind our anxiety is our concern with other people’s opinion of us. And this realization, that if you know your craft you need not be concerned with what people think about you, will help us be more confident with regards to external circumstances.

Of course, this won’t eliminate those feelings at once, practice is essential. And it’s not even required that you have to practice those by actually facing those situations. Although you should if you have the opportunity to do so, most of the time you won’t have those things available to you. By ‘those things’, I mean speaking in public, talking to strangers, meeting someone ‘important’, and so on.

This can even be applied in the digital world. Many people have good things to share, but they don’t due to fear of criticism and so on—on YouTube, on a Blog, etc. Only if they overcome that fear and do those things, the world can actually benefit from their work.

Fear, as Seneca (I think) said, is caused by ignorance. ’Ignorance of what?’, you may ask. Ignorance...

* that people really don’t care about what we do as much as we think they do; 
* that if we know our craft better than them, we need not be afraid of their opinions because why should an expert be afraid of what amateurs say; 
* that they will criticize you even if you were a Sage; 
* and that what people think of you is not in your control so you need not be concerned about their opinions. 

Epictetus explained this with the example of Zeno, the founder of our school, which will clarify the point further:

“All of which explains why Zeno was not nervous about his meeting with Antigonus. What Zeno valued Antigonus had no power over, and as a philosopher he cared nothing for the things that the king did command. It was Antigonus who was anxious before their meeting. Naturally—he wanted to make a good impression, which was beyond his control. Zeno, for his part, had no wish to please the king; no expert needs validation from an amateur.”",Stoicism,1613277736.0,t3_ljhhzy,0.99,936

"I'm surprised at how much useful ground is covered by the phrase ""don't cling""","Resentment and frustration are the feelings of holding to a failed expectation. Don't cling to them. 

Vanity and greed are the desires for things that we overvalue. Fear, anxiety, and anger are the feelings of concern that we might lose something that we overvalue. Don't cling to these things.

Argument is the result of overvaluing the results of our judgement and preferences. Don't cling to them.

Vice is false belief, and we can hold on to our mistaken beliefs very tightly. Don't cling to them.

I have been entertaining myself for the last day or so with the following exercise: whenever I become aware of some small distress, I try to explain this distress in terms of my clinging to something that I shouldn't. So far I've yet to encounter something that couldn't be usefully described this way.

Most of the time, these minor distresses are caused by unwelcome surprises, which is just another way of saying ""by failed expectations"". Damn, we're out of tuna. My view of reality was wrong, and it just got corrected. It hurts exactly to the extent that I hold on to the old, flawed version. If I knew all along we were out of tuna, there would be no distress at all.

Sometimes the minor distresses are anxieties; dreading an annoying task ahead, for example. Of course it's not an annoying task, it's not even a task, _it's the thing I choose to do_, but I am seeing it in this crazy hurtful way because I overvalue my routine and I cling to it.

Sometimes my distresses are physical discomforts, poor sleep, aches and pains. If things had been ten times worse all week, this level of discomfort would be a welcome relief! It only feels bad because I'm comparing it to a level of comfort I once knew, and am clinging to, as if perpetual enjoyment of a 20 year old body were a god-given birthright or something.

"How noble and good everyone could be if, every evening before falling asleep, they were to recall to their minds the events of the while day and consider exactly what has been good and bad. Then, without realizing it you try to improve yourself at the start of each new day"" Anne Frank","""People who have a religion should be glad, for not everyone has the gift of believing in heavenly things. You don't necessarily even have to be afraid of punishment after death; purgatory, hell, and heaven are things that a lot of people can't accept, but still a religion, it doesn't matter which, keeps a person on the right path. It isn't the fear of God but the upholding of one's own honor and conscience.

Seneca - On The Shortness of Life,"# Life is short if you waste it on trivialities.

People have always been good at wasting time. Most people spend the majority of their time engaged in trivial activities – even if these activities don’t seem trivial to them.

But the thing about trivial activities is that they make life seem short. For instance, life will seem especially short if you only pursue status or power. You’ll always have your eye on some future goal and won’t be able to enjoy your current situation.

People tend to think that, once they’ve achieved all their goals, they’ll have time to enjoy life. But it rarely works out this way. What usually happens is this: people spend their life *preparing* for life.

The Emperor Augustus is a case in point. He spoke endlessly of quietude, of the calm and rest he’d enjoy upon retirement from his public duties. But this longed-for day never came. The Roman Empire depended on him, and he could never pull himself away.

Life will also seem short to those who pursue a life of luxury. These people can't even enjoy their indulgences. They’ll always be thinking of how their current thrill will soon end, or where their next one will come from.

But worst of all are those who seek glory after death. These people get wrapped up in planning for a posterity that’s not even theirs. They'll be thinking of that pithy remark in their obituary. Or they’ll draw up plans for giant tombs. But funerals ought to be simple symbolic affairs. In fact, there is nothing more suitable than a single burning candle, an apt symbol for the shortness of human life. 

# Busyness doesn’t equal fulfillment.

Say a ship left port and spent the next year being thrown about by a mighty storm. It would be inaccurate to claim that, during this time, it had steered a successful and purposeful course, even if it did make it safely back to harbor. Well, the same can be said of life.

Pitching, rolling and yawing aren’t substitutes for living. Of course, it’s important to plot a course and then stick to it, but it’s also worth remembering that not every path should be pursued.

Some people are happy to spend their lives tacking and jibing through the wind, constantly changing direction. They worry they’re not headed in the right direction and they pine for what they’ve left behind.

Other people, through sheer apathy, are happy to be buffeted about by the waves. They only stop drifting when they are too tired or too old to carry on.

And then there are those who devote their prime years to lust, greed and gluttony. They keep telling themselves that, someday, they’ll amend their ways – but they never do.

For some, by the time they feel that the moment is right, they’re too old or too weak to change their habits. For others, even if they could prolong their lives threefold, they still wouldn't change.

Worst of all, however, is to be borne away on the winds of somebody else’s preoccupations.

It’s pointless working for someone whose aims and convictions don’t agree with your own. Doing so is the surest path to a short life. When this happens, your obsessions and worries won’t even be your own, and you’re destined to run aground.

When stuck in such a situation, people moan that their boss or supervisor doesn’t listen to their wishes or opinions. But if these people can’t find the time to listen to *themselves* and pursue their own courses, why should anybody else? 

# You can choose to be educated by the world’s greatest minds.

While you have little power to change who raised you or who you were raised with, the fact remains that you can forge your own path in education and self-improvement.

It’s astonishingly easy to acquire wisdom from great thinkers and, in time, to train yourself to be a better person. You can, for example, engage with the works of Plato or Hegel, Derrida or Arendt, and come to a better understanding of people, power, society and culture.

Pick your philosopher, and discover new ways to tackle life, from the everyday trifles to universal preoccupations. A great thinker can be both a solace and a companion.

What’s even better is that they’re always available. You can engage with such thinkers on a daily basis, and they’ll speak truth every time, pointing out your attributes, both negative and positive, without sugarcoating things.

And when you’re done, you can just set them back on the shelf. They’re not going to sap your energy as real people might.

Furthermore, because this mental engagement will only have positive effects, these thinkers will prolong your life rather than shorten it. And even if you’re nearing the end of life, reading is still a boon, for by reading you can learn not only how to live but how to face death unflinchingly.

However, you have to be careful when selecting which great minds to read and what you will glean from them. There’s no point reading just to compile trivial facts; you have to educate yourself purposefully. Life is long enough to devote yourself to self-knowledge and true wisdom. The great minds are your torchbearers in this task. 

# True satisfaction springs from within.

In life, we often experience ephemeral sensations that may temporarily perk us up, but they are not within our control, and the pleasure they engender often vanishes as quickly as it appears.

A wise person is self-reliant and independent. The loss of status or money is no real setback to him, since his sense of self is not founded on external circumstances.

Once you find yourself motivated by greed instead of necessity, you will remain forever impoverished.

The surest path to true satisfaction is to conduct yourself within your means and to appreciate your lot in life. This way, you will never feel that you’re lacking anything. The instant you start to covet unnecessary material items, however, you will feel that you are stuck in a sort of poverty.

To use an analogy: if you crave water not because you're thirsty but because you’re feverish, your craving will never be satisfied. Such a craving is not necessity; it’s sickness.

This holds just as true for possessions and power as it does for water and food, or pretty much any desire you can think of.

It all boils down to this: the important things in life can’t be removed or diminished by others. It’s simply not within the capacity of a mere mortal to rob you of your critical faculties or to eradicate your ability to appreciate the beauty of the mountains or the sea.

No matter where you are or what you are doing, whether in exile or in your homeland, whether ill or well, know this: you may always survey the heavens and contemplate the most profound aspects of existence.

So remember: self-worth comes from within. Only you can determine how satisfied you are with the world around you. 

# To ensure a tranquil mind, tailor your career to your personality and don’t forget to enjoy yourself!

There is no point whatsoever in having what appears to be an enviable life when you’re actually fractured inside. A life filled with doubts and regrets is no life at all. So what should you do?

The first thing to realize is that there is no one path that will ensure tranquility. We must each forge our own. For instance, some people are more suited to a life of study and reflection. Others might need sustained physical exertion to be contented.

But no matter how you conduct your life, be sure to serve mankind with actions, writing or your intellect – at least, to the best of your abilities.

You won’t gain anything by taking on tasks to which you are ill suited. Accept only those enterprises that you are sure you will finish.

Have faith in yourself. Trust your instincts. And don’t be too harsh on yourself once you have selected your course. You will enjoy the journey all the more if you have confidence in yourself and your actions.

The second thing to remember is that overexertion will smother your faculties and sap your spirit. In short, don’t overdo it. You wouldn’t incessantly till the soil and expect a cornucopia every time. So don’t always work your fingers to the bone. Ultimately, it’s just counterproductive.

Instead, set aside some time for yourself. Relax. Even Cato, the famous Roman, used to drink a glass of wine when he returned home from a long day of statesmanly activity. And Socrates, when he wasn’t philosophizing, enjoyed playing with the local children.

So don’t forget the value of pleasure, and don’t think you shouldn’t enjoy yourself.

Moderation is the best policy. Some possessions and leisure pursuits may help you relax, but don’t overindulge. Material objects and external pursuits shouldn’t define your happiness.",Stoicism,1613150452.0,t3_lifqdh,0.99,906

“Your mind will be like its habitual thoughts; for the soul becomes dyed with the colour of its thoughts.” Marcus Aurelius," “Your mind will be like its habitual thoughts; for the soul becomes dyed with the colour of its thoughts.” Marcus Aurelius

                Repetition is the key to success. No where is this truer than our thoughts. We can create a successful environment for ourselves when we work with ourselves and not against ourselves. Whether creating a reminder on our phone to stand an extra five minutes each hour, to set a goal every day to write 500 words towards our first novel, or anything other achievement we strive for.

                It begins with our thoughts. If we feed the good thoughts, we grow the pathways in our minds that will help to get us where we need to go. While if we continue to dig the same hole that we wish to get out of we will only sink deeper into the same thought processes that keep us where we’re at.

                As Marcus Aurelius wrote, “for the soul becomes dyed with the colour of its thoughts.” You have it within yourself to masters your thoughts. It just takes practice, repletion, and above all cultivating the will you need to get where you need to go.

Not ever.”","This is an excerpt from the book [Designing Your Life: How to Build a Well-Lived, Joyful Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30240076-designing-your-life?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=KSQhhB0V1e&rank=1) by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans.

And, even though I am a graphic designer by trade, I am skeptical of the idea of applying ""design thinking"" to every aspect of one's life. While it is an interesting notion, and may have some applications in some select areas, I feel it's a stretch to conclude that it can be applied across the board, in every situation.

Having said that, however, I don't think one can argue with the truth of this statement (taken out of context though it may be), when looked at from a Stoic perspective. What I think is most interesting and relevant here is that a concept that is so central to Stoicism is being expressed in a completely different context. Even though this is a basic tenet of Stoicism, and no new ground is being broken here, I love it when the universality of philosophical ideas reveals itself in unexpected places.

A better way to look at it is: ""We are all imature, impulsive creatures, that eventually break down""
The question is which of us can pretend to be mature longer then others.

If you think of it this way, you stop hating on the other person with thoughts like:

""She's a bitch, she's so immature""
""He'sa crybaby, he breaks down so easily""

You Must Read To Lead,"From ""The Daily Stoic"" email list:

---

Many “smart” people aren’t actually smart. They just know a lot of trivia. Sure, they can tell you all sorts of facts, they have a library of big thick books filled with enormous words, or they can give you the up-to-the-minute news about a political race. But can they tell you what any of this means? Do they do anything important with this information? Of course not.

And these types have always existed. Seneca spoke critically of literary snobs who could speculate for hours about whether The Iliad or The Odyssey was written first, or who the real author was (a debate that rages on today). He disliked hearing people chatter about which Roman general did this or that first, or which received this or that honor. “Far too many good brains,” he said, “have been afflicted by the pointless enthusiasm for useless knowledge.”

Harry Truman famously said that not all all readers are leaders but all leader are readers—they have to be. And they certainly aren’t reading to impress people or for the mental gymnastics. It’s to get better! It’s to find things they can use. Not at the dinner table or on Twitter, but in their real lives.

The same must be true to us. We have to learn how to read to be better leaders, better people, better citizens. We must learn how to read for our own benefit—and so that we might have aid to offer to a friend in pain, or a soul in crisis. Seneca’s point was that only knowledge that does us good is worth knowing. Everything else is trivia.

At this point, I cannot afford to spend that much amount for a 5 days trip as I am saving money to make capital for my startup company.

So, instead I joined gym earlier this evening and just returned from my first ever work out in long years. I decided, I'm gonna make more money in coming months and then I'll go for the trek. By that time, I'll be in better shape with good stamina that can help me enjoy the trek even better.

"""Remind yourself that your task is to be a good human being; remind yourself what nature demands of people. Then do it, without hesitation, and speak the truth as you see it. But with kindness. With humility. Without hypocrisy.” Marcus Aurelius (Meditations, Book 8, Section 5)","“The first step: Don’t be anxious. Nature controls it all. And before long you’ll be no one, nowhere—like Hadrian, like Augustus.

The second step: Concentrate on what you have to do. Fix your eyes on it. Remind yourself that your task is to be a good human being; remind yourself what nature demands of people. Then do it, without hesitation, and speak the truth as you see it. But with kindness. With humility. Without hypocrisy.”

Marcus Aurelius (Meditations, Book 8, Section 5)

Remembering that one day there will be an end can seem like a morbid topic to bring about in discussion with your friends. But it’s a reality that meets us whether we choose to think about it or not. I am not saying live everyday like your last, but I also am. Marcus Aurelius wrote, “The first step: Don’t be anxious. Nature controls it all. And before long you’ll be no one, nowhere—like Hadrian, like Augustus.” Not being anxious of the end, but cognizant of its existence in our life. Once you’ve accepted the truth you can move forward. 

But, in it all living the best life I can being kind, thoughtful, and above all working towards my goals wherever my life takes me I will be happy that I chose the path that I did. 

To meet my goals, “Concentrate on what you have to do,” staying focused on my path, and if I cannot help others leaving them be. Not being distracted my extrinsic forces that do nothing for me, but distract me for my ultimate goals.

Above all as I move about life acting and speaking with, “kindness. With humility. Without hypocrisy.” Doing my best to live life in moderation, and bringing impactful good to myself and those around me.

Life is not a sprint,"Life is not a sprint, we are usually unsatisfied with what our life is, and we compare ourselves to other more successful people, constantly looking to the future potential of what our lives could be. The reality is that we always live in the present, and we should not compare ourselves to others, but rather focus on improving ourselves both **mentally** and **physically**.

It is hard since we are surrounded by a culture that convinces us that the more stuff we have and the more popular we are, the happier we will be. It is true that material stuff brings us happiness, but it is a trap. It gives us short term pleasure and a desire for more material, an insatiable desire that cannot be quenched since we want more and more.

The stuff we frequently chase in life reveal to be rather petty and insignificant in the grand scheme of things. We must define our happiness not by what we own or achieve and not by others see us as, but by **how we think**, **how we view ourselves**, and **how we live our life** through our virtues.

And this can be attained by accepting reality as it is, being indifferent to what we cannot control and pursuing our own self-improvement. To Stoicism, this is how we remain happy and satisfied with ourselves.",Stoicism,1599910922.0,t3_irb3gz,0.99,877

Only one person came to my meal,"Hosted a birthday meal a few days ago with work colleagues, only one person turned up to it out of a possible 20. Some people had their excuses, others didn’t say whether they would come or not, others said yes but then never showed up, others only told me afterwards why they didn’t come. The one person who showed up didn’t judge me or make me feel weird about it.

A few years ago, that would have made me really sad and sent me down a spiral of shame and self-loathing. But I just felt happy that one person turned up. If that person hadn’t turned up, I still would have eaten.

Just felt like sharing this positivity! It feels good to have confidence in myself, and I would be more than happy to host something else and be like ‘I’m having this meal on this day at this time, come or don’t come, I’m enjoying myself either way’.

Edit: thanks for the gold and silver, kind people! I’ve got to admit I’m a *little* bit salty towards the people who said they would definitely come but then never showed or said sorry. These same people constantly ask me for favours at work!

The realization of choice has changed my entire life,"One of the key tenants of Stoicism is that we should focus on what we CAN control. To be honest, I think people truly underestimate just how much we control and how much choice in the matter we have.

I read that Victor Frankl quote“**Between stimulus and response there is a space.** **In that space is our power to choose our response.** **In our response lies our growth and our freedom.”**

Throughout my day I can catch myself feeling that initial response to stimulus.

Something bad happens - my knee-jerk response is often very negative. I got chewed out at work the other day over something that wasn't my fault and my initial feelings were anger, and an IMMEDIATE need to defend my ego. Then I stopped for a second, took a breath, and realized that misunderstandings happen and it's a small moment in time that will pass. Then I moved on. My day was not ruined. Had I dwelled on this and chose to get dragged into hell by my initial emotion, I likely would have had a super shitty day and potentially a bad WEEK.

I've stopped worrying about things with this mindset. If something bad is going to happen in the future, it will simply happen, and I will respond to it with calm acceptance and do my best with what I can control.

I used to feel lots of resentment and envy towards people, and that has stopped too. I feel myself having those thoughts....stop for a second, then realize that envy and resentment get me nowhere and at the end of the day I want others to be happy and fulfilled. So how does envy and resentment even make sense? Then it immediately dissipates.

My life is just....so much better because of this philosophy. It's not a philosophy to me, it's a daily practice. Just thought I would share that. I love hearing success stories so I thought I would share mine.",Stoicism,1658194048.0,t3_w2g0vz,1.0,872

&#x200B;

Her: ""Hey, do you have instagram"" 

To which I reply

Me: ""Nah sorry""

Her: ""well, do you have facebook?""

Me: ""Don't have that either""

keep in mind, the question she then asks isn't along the lines of ""well how do you keep up to date with your friends"" or ""how do you let people know whats going on with you""

She asks me this

Her: ""Do you even exist?"" 

As a joke I say

Me: ""I think, therefore I am""

and we just joke a little bit, and that was all

But it struck a nerve with me, some people are truly not living, they live behind what they project, and once you take that wall down, they cease to have any meaning, their friends, lovers, personality, humour, style, skills.... all so fragile that they need to keep it up for all to see.

This has affected my ability to concentrate and taking the easy way out of much of my challenges the past few years.

The past few months, I've noticed it escalating and hence have been trying to combat it to varying affect. Just like the deep-rooted uncomfortability and unhappiness I feel wasn't made in a day nor can I really break it down and squash it in a day but I'm trying. 

I noticed one thing, that when I tried convincing myself I was sad and feeling pity for myself that it was self-fulfilling prophecy. Nor is trying to force myself into a false sense of happiness a real fix for the issue either. What I've noticed really works is a ""blank"" open mindset, not really being fixated on one thing but open, open to new ideas/experiences and accepting that things are beyond my control but I can accept to control how I react to them instead of them controlling me.


A dependence on the future and an absence of flux only seems to put you on the loop of ""I feel unhappy"" therefore ""I must be unhappy"".

"Stoicism is not about ""dealing with emotions""","I can't help but notice that the idea that Stoicism is about ""dealing with emotions"" (mainly in the form of suppressing them) is taken from Star Trek, specifically the character of Mr Spock. It's an oddity that more people seem to believe in this interpretation over the interpretations of actual Stoic philosophers.

Here are some things that are completely specific to Mr Spock, and have nothing to do with Stoicism

* suppressing emotions
* separating emotions from ""thinking""
* ignoring emotions
* acting in spite of emotions
* disregarding emotions

Stoics predate the unusual modern pretension that says ""I want to believe something negative, yet experience positive emotions in the scenario where that belief applies"". Many posts on this forum are of the following form, and they all contain this error:

* I have formed the belief that I hate my parents. How can I feel calm around my parents?
* I have formed the belief that I must date my friend, and if she rejects me I will never be happy. How can I not fear her rejecting me?
* I have formed the belief that not to pass my exam would devastate my life. How can I stop worrying about passing this exam?
* I have formed the belief that money is the most important thing. How can I stop feeling inadequate when a person is wealthier than me?
* I have formed the belief that my friends are betraying me. How can I stop feeling angry and anxious around my friends?

Of course people do not word these posts with such self-awareness. A good example of this phenomenon is the recent post...

""I ordered an item I've been excited to receive this April, and it's been delayed to late July. What techniques can I use to stop feeling so sad about the delay?"".

What you see here is ""I have formed the belief that I am being deprived of fun. How can I not feel as though I am missing out on fun?"". In this example you can see the inverted relationship between an emotion and a belief. The poster completely discounts the possibility that the emotion came from a belief, or that this belief could be altered so that he did not have this emotional response, and so simply asks ""how can I hold this belief yet not experience the emotions appropriate to a person with this belief?"".

Emotions do not occur *then we form beliefs about them -* we form beliefs and then we experience those beliefs as emotions. When you are experiencing an emotion, *that is you experiencing your belief in that situation*. If you are in a boxing match, and you believe you will win easily, you will experience that belief as the emotion of confidence. If you believe you are going to be beaten badly, you will experience that belief as the emotion of fear.

The easiest way to completely misunderstand Stoicism is to take ""Spock Logic"", which is ""have emotion, then use mental techniques to suppress it"" and try to apply it to the philosophy. Stoic philosophers had not seen Star Trek, and so they thought completely correctly about emotions - they implicitly assume the correct position, which is that you will experience emotions consistent with your beliefs in any given scenario.

Read the following passage from Epictetus, and look how obvious this implicit assumption is:

>Men are disturbed, not by things, but by the principles and notions which they form concerning things. Death, for instance, is not terrible, else it would have appeared so to Socrates. But the terror consists in our notion of death that it is terrible. When therefore we are hindered, or disturbed, or grieved, let us never attribute it to others, but to ourselves; that is, to our own principles. An uninstructed person will lay the fault of his own bad condition upon others. Someone just starting instruction will lay the fault on himself. Some who is perfectly instructed will place blame neither on others nor on himself.

There are no ""techniques"" here, no ""tricks"", nothing to occur *after* an emotion is experienced. Throughout the work of the philosophers there is just one relentless, obvious and intuitive assumption - that your beliefs dictate your emotional experience, and that if you want a different emotional experience then the hard study and practice of philosophy is required.

Once you've begun experiencing a negative emotion, you've already failed - you've arrived in a situation for which you were unprepared, and you've experienced the negative emotions that are the outcome of being unprepared. If you find yourself in a situation that you have not prepared for, you cannot ""quickly do all the preparation"" after the situation has begun occurring. This is like arranging to play a guitar solo in front of an audience of people, arriving at the venue, standing on stage with your guitar, and then saying ""can somebody quickly show me how to play guitar, for I've found myself in a situation that requires it!"".",Stoicism,1624293012.0,t3_o4z5oz,0.97,866

I'm saying this because I was always a be a man, pull yourself up by the bootstraps, mind over matter believer.  I was raised that way.  I had all the ideals of stoicism but not the tools to use it.  If you are struggling, get help.  It is worth it.",Stoicism,1609362346.0,t3_knatn1,0.98,864

The man who sleeps on the floor can never fall out of bed - Alan Watts (who said it was a proverb from somewhere else),"You can definitely interpret this in a number of different ways, but the one that sticks out to me is that when you sleep on the floor you are grounded, and when you're on a bed you are on a sort of comfortable cloud that helps you forget the hardness of the ground.

When you're already grounded in reality, it will never take you by surprise. It's important to avoid the comfort of self-delusion, to know the nature of reality so that you don't get hurt by it",Stoicism,1622449342.0,t3_noyd0f,0.98,861
How to stop being the slave of own desires. Use these 5 laws to finally see how your desires fuck you over,"Hey fellows,

We've all been there. Pursuing someone who didn't seem to share the same feelings. Looking forward to the precise moment of achieving our long desired goals, only to realise that the very process of achieving them was much more satisfactory than the achievment itself. Saving money to buy a new fancy cloth just to find out that it lost its shine as soon as you got accustomed to it. Imaginative power of strong desires creates an illusion that their fulfillment is all we need.

Stoicism views most of self-inflicted sufferings as driven by those illusions of our mind. Stoics acknowledged and examined such irrational, destructive tendencies of the mind that each of us has observed in ourselves and others. Lust or exessive desire is one of them.

Lust is an irrational desire or pursuit of an expected good. The Stoics divided rational and irrational desires based on their ""natural"" or ""unnatural"" character. We, as human beings, have two kinds of needs. Some of them have natural limits. These desires are finite and can be fully satisfied with relative ease. They can recur, so the satisfaction isn't permanent. But the measure of them is transparent and sustainable. We desire to eat until we aren't hungry, desire to drink until we aren't thirsty. The same thing that satisfied us yesterday can do it today too.

Other needs, such as the wish for status, wealth, or fame, are the product of our social environment that stimulates the desire for things that we don't actually need. Remember the last time you bought that sexy pair of sneakers because you thought it would make you look fabulous. Desires of this artificial kind are never quite satisfying. Because they aren't linked to a particular need, they have no natural limits. Their fulfillment isn't as pleasing as we imagined, and we must always pursue newer and bigger objects.

**There are mainly five ways in which unnatural desires give us empty promises:**

1. **We're never satisfied with what we have and always want more.** The Stoics observed that getting what we want never feels as good as we imagined it. This only makes us want more. New desires appear and replace those that are already fulfilled. Our minds seem to have a desire for desire itself and buy into the illusion that fulfilling a desire will bring us to an endpoint. However, the end never arrives, and this cycle starts all over again.
2. **We most desire what we do not or cannot have.** By some perverse force within us, the more distant and unattainable the object is, the greater is our desire to have it. We've all been there. As soon as someone we liked started pulling away, it only made us want them stronger.
3. **Pursuit of a thing is more pleasing than the possession of it.** Another deception identified by the Stoics: when we work toward a goal, we imagine the happiness that its attainment will bring. But the pursuit itself turns out to be more enjoyable than the capture of the thing pursued.
4. **Possession of a thing and familiarity with it tend to produce indifference or disgust.** By nature, we humans are not easily contented with our circumstances. By nature, the moment we possess something or get what we want, our minds begin to drift toward something new and different, to imagine we can have better. Possessing a thing tends to bring about indifference towards it.
5. **We mismeasure the value of what we have or don't have by comparing it to our expectations or others' possessions.** Fulfillment of our desires fails to satisfy in part because we measure our satisfaction with what we have by comparing it to what others have. It is always possible to find some who seem to be ahead of us or to have more than us, and those tend to be the only comparisons we care about. Everyone can be envious of somebody – if not of one who is achieving more, then of one who is achieving something else.

**Being aware of these biases, always ask yourself whether the object of pursuit is really worth it? Is it useful for your long-term goals? Imagine already having it. Does it bring the real value to your life besides the very pleasure of attainment?**  


P.S. If you liked this exercise, I have written more lessons like that. Just in case you **are curious to explore more**, let me know and I will share the link to **other lessons** in DM.

The themes I cover are: getting disciplined, reducing anxiety, learning about your life values, decision-making, the art of happiness, and being present in the moment.

The lessons are based on the primary sources of wisdom from more than 2500 years of history of philosophy: Plato, Aristotle, Lao Tzu, Carl Jung, Stoics, and many others.",Stoicism,1619004892.0,t3_mvdpxq,0.99,865
Memento Mori - remember one day you die. Be. Here. Now.,"When you wake up today to face the uncertainty and turmoil of the world in order to accomplish the tasks and goals you've previously set out for yourself, please remind yourself - Memento Mori, death is inevitable.

In today's age of information and disinformation we are constantly bombarded with a stream of events that are outside of our control, but know that at the centre of those events are brave people who live each day knowing that it may be their last.  It's ok to feel emotional, it's ok to feel afraid, and it's ok to worry about the worst-case scenarios and plan for what you may do in such catastrophic events. 

Then remind yourself that whatever happens in the grand scheme of things is largely outside of your control; and that there is nothing you can actually do to change them and that there is no point in wishing that things may have turned out different, or that you did things differently in the past to change your circumstances today.

As you go through your day, take a pause in each moment and each situation and remind yourself why you're here; your actions and your reasons and your passions led you to this moment, to embark on whatever endeavor it is that you're currently pursuing; be it work, school, serving your country and community, taking care of loved ones, or simply taking time to yourself - whatever it is, you must ensure that you are *being* in this moment, and so are the people around you.  

So why allow this moment to pass without a smile?  Why allow this moment to pass without a friendly hello and conversation with your neighbours and acquaintances?  Why allow yourself to scold your loved ones, be they your children or parents or spouse?  That is not how you intended for this moment to be when you embarked on this journey, so why would you let these precious moments we have left slip away?

Please remember the inevitable; this is all temporary, and this too shall pass, even life.  Hug your loved ones, make their day as special as you can.  Be friendly and smile to your neighbours and acquaintances, and extract the best possible thing that you can from this very moment.  Do the thing that you've been putting off for so long that is nagging in the back of your head.  And if you can, take time to relax and do the things you enjoy - for self-care and reflection are just as important as purpose and self-improvement.

Don't let another moment go to waste.  Do not allow yourself to become perturbed by the negative thoughts and actions of others, instead understand that collectively we are experiencing trauma most of us never thought we would experience in our generation and not everyone can process it as well as you; the practitioner of stoicism and philosophy, or the practitioner of religion and the devout, or the practitioner of believing in humanity and something greater than yourself.  If you can talk to someone to help them be rational and level-headed during these unprecedented times, then please do so - but do not take to heart if you cannot change their minds.  Do not allow yourself to be perturbed.

Observations by a dying stoic - part 5,"I started posting about my situation on Reddit back in January 2021 when I was diagnosed with Stage IV Pancreatic Cancer.  Since then I’ve been focused on how my stoic practice/training is holding up under the challenges. Right now the cancer seems to be held in check and I feel better than I have for a year. I made some adjustments in eating and exercising that should have been done years ago, but at least they are in motion now.

After the initial shock of the diagnosis, my focus really has been on beating the cancer, not fretting about now many days I have left. When I told my best-friend he showed up at my door carrying encouragement, support and lots of helpful supplements. Took me to the surgery to get my port installed and generally has been supporting me as he could. I got a call on Sunday that he had passed away a couple of days before. I had just spoken to him 1 or 2 days before. He was not in the best of health, but looks like COVID took him out. 

So now the stoic shoe is on the other foot so to speak. Here he was doing what he could to save me and now he’s just gone. He was my best friend from the sixth grade (40 plus years!). He was worried about me but I ended up outliving him. Just another of those reminders that we are not guaranteed anything beyond the current moment. Provides a pretty stark reminder to enjoy your time now, or as in the words of the late great Warren Zevon, “Enjoy every sandwich.”

This will provide a little course correction, I think. I’ve tried to live my life as normally as before the diagnosis, and except for the days when the chemo really hit me I’ve done that. But there has been a certain self-centeredness to my mid-set, after all I’m the one dying here. But that really wasn’t true when to came to my friend and me. I’ll be spending the next few days pondering all of this. I think the shift in thinking will be good, more focus on leaving each interaction with others on a good note to avoid that whole “but the last time I saw them I yelled at them for something stupid, and now there’s no way to make it right.”

So some of the things swirling around my head now:

· More focus on others – what does this look like?

· Fix problems as soon as they arise – particularly people problems

· Less focus on things (once affairs are in order) that will belong to someone else before too long – let it go!

· In any case, I’ll essentially be forgotten within a few generations, make sure those closest to me are cared for as well as possible after my passing – it won’t matter to me once I’m gone, but will ease the transition, I think.",Stoicism,1634680028.0,t3_qbltym,0.99,862

A guy from a party tried to kill me and I thought it was a teachable moment.,"I'll try to make a long story short, I was doing a guy I barely know a favor, but when I told him I was giving his car keys to his parents because I didnt trust him with them, he snapped. He grabbed a fire extinguisher from his car and said ""I didnt want to have to do this, you made me""

He had already said he would ""slit my throat""  ""make sure you're going to die tonight""  multiple times prior, so when he grabbed a fire extinguisher I started to take him seriously.

Guy was being quite the jerk all night and there was a girl I just met and another drunken friend who was very scared looking on. 

I grappled him, he tried to bite off my ear and my chest through my jacket, he tried to gouge my eyes leaving scratches and bleeding on my face. I held him in a pin and told him ""I'm your friend and I'm going to do everything I can to keep you safe tonight""

Eventually he was arrested for a DUI after escaping his parents house where I had left him, but I felt I did everything I could to help.

Now my one friend stayed quiet but the girl was angry with me. She wanted me to hurt him, she didnt talk to me again after that and she was completely sober. I tried to explain that I didnt believe in fighting but it was an awkward ride home (she elected to drive me home so I could drive the guy home in his car, we are nice people).

Quick flex I'm 240 pounds, at one time the best highschool wrestler in the country, I do MMA and in the top 1% for fitness. 

I heard a quote today ""those who have weapons and keep them sheathed shall inherit the earth""

That really resonated with me. Maybe I'm wrong. Everyone has their own opinions.

*edit*

While the quick flex was definitely a brag, It is an important detail. If I was an average guy, I don't know who I'd be or how I'd react. But I've always been bigger and athletic. Psychologically speaking I might be a very different person if I grew up otherwise. I never thought about it until recently someone pointed out that it was the reason I'm never scared in situations like that.

How to never be insulted again. A lesson from Marcus Aurelius,"Hi fellow Stoics!

After getting very warm feedback from many of you guys on my previous post on [coping with pain](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/mk1ii3/stoicism_for_pain_relief_how_i_helped_my_father/), I've decided to keep posting stoic practical exercises here more regularly.

This time we will talk about the role of judgment. As many of you might have heard, excellence comes not as a result of a single action but habits and constant work on improving yourself and correcting your own flaws.

Each of us has lots of things to work on in ourselves, but most of our flaws try to hide behind. The Stoic emperor Marcus Aurelius had not been an exception before he internalized the wisdom of stoicism. One cannot become a teacher without being a student. Students of Stoicism benefited from their tutors' wisdom by treating them both as models, whose behavior they were inspired to emulate, and mentors who could give them valuable advice.

But why do we need the tutor in the first place? Aesop put it beautifully in one of his fables. Each of us has two sacks, one with the flaws of others, and it hangs within our view. Another is behind our back, filled with our own faults. That's why we see others' flaws quite clearly, but can't really see our own.

So we need someone else around to spot those faults. And it's not necessary for someone to stand there all the time. Instead, it can be the image of someone who we deeply respect and admire.

So let's proceed with the exercise.

&#x200B;

>Hi! My name is Marcus Aurelius, an emperor from the Golden Age of Rome.  
>  
>During my time as Roman Emperor, I fought many wars for our empire's glory and peace and faced many hardships. But I found that people's inner peace doesn't depend on neither external stability nor fortunate events.  
>  
>For us Stoics, the key to inner peace lies in our judgment. The wrong judgment will lead to disturbance and suffering even in the most fortunate circumstances. While right one will preserve our inner calmness against all of life's hardships.  
>  
>Stoics believe that our mind's balanced state is disturbed by intense emotions, especially by negative ones, such as anger, despair, fear, or envy.  
>  
>But also, an obsessive passion might disturb our inner peace.  
>  
>Our emotions are not caused by things or events themselves but by our judgment about them.  
>  
>Think of a perfectly straight stick. When you put it underwater, it will appear as bent or broken to the onlooker.  
>  
>While external things and events may not be under our control, we certainly control our judgment. Therefore, we have the key to our inner peace always at our disposal.  
>  
>Let me give you an example. Imagine you are insulted by two different people. Both are calling you ""a failure."" Now, if the first person appeared to be a mad man who randomly insulted you in the street, you most likely wouldn't care too much. Buf if a beloved one, like your father or your sister, would call you ""a failure,"" it would probably hurt you.  
>  
>But why is that? In both cases, the insult was the same. The reason lies in our value judgments and expectations. The person on the street doesn't know you, and you might not even care what he thinks of you. Also, the fact that he appears to be mentally ill makes his behavior expectable.  
>  
>On the other hand, we usually want our beloved ones to have a positive picture of us. We expect them not to insult and hurt us. Even though it's ultimately not under our control.  
>  
>**When was the last time you were insulted? How did it make you feel? Try to identify the underlying judgment and expectation towards the other person.**  
>  
>This exercise is supposed to emphasize the role that our judgments play in forming our emotions.  
>  
>So far, so good. But in which way should we change our judgments to preserve our inner calmness when we face adversity and hardship?  
>  
>We should change them in a way so that they reflect the level of control we have over a particular object, person, or event.  
>  
>Think of it like that - we don't control external things, such as the weather, illness, and other people's behavior.  
>  
>So the reason we get hurt by other peoples' insults is that we assume them to act according to our expectations about how they ought to behave towards us. And since we cannot ultimately control behaviors or opinions of others, such unrealistic expectations might provoke frustration and anger when those expectations are not met.  
>  
>I firmly believe that we should focus and care more about the things within our power, about our character and judgments, and less about external things.  
>  
>It just so happens that we as humans are naturally drawn to them.  
>  
>Let's leave it here for now. We will discuss internal and external things and how we should deal with them in the next lesson. I hope you will join me!  
>  
>And now, I would like to introduce you to an exercise that will help you to control your emotions through exercising your judgment.  
>  
>**The exercise is called ""Role model.""** **Imagine that an ideal Stoic person observes what you are doing. Whenever you are about to lose your inner peace, you should ask him or her how you could reframe your perspective, accounting for things within and without your control.**  
>  
>**This ideal person might be your favorite teacher, grandfather, priest, or favorite author. Just think of them as Stoics in this exercise.**  
>  
>Hope this exercise helps.  
>  
>Remember, if you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.  
>  
>See you in the next lesson!

Marcus's view on anger,"“Keep this thought handy when you feel a fit of rage coming on—it isn’t manly to be enraged. Rather, gentleness and civility are more human, and therefore manlier. A real man doesn’t give way to anger and discontent, and such a person has strength, courage, and endurance—unlike the angry and complaining. The nearer a man comes to a calm mind, the closer he is to strength.”

His unique opportunity lies in the way in which he bears his burden.” – Viktor Frankl**

&#x200B;

>**“But there was no need to be ashamed of tears, for tears bore witness that a man had the greatest of courage, the courage to suffer.” – Viktor Frankl**

"Seneca was a billionaire statesman. Marcus Aurelius was the emperor of Rome. What does it mean to take instruction from men in these ultra-privileged positions with regard to our own, far less successful, lives?","This is an odd question and I'm still not sure quite what motivates it nor what I'm trying to clarify.

Briefly, I think I have a concern about whether a philosophy espoused by hyper-famous, ultra-successful individuals can truly get into the humdrum, prosaic stresses and concerns that confront those of us who are neither billionaires nor emperors.

It seems strange that people who can have had no idea what it feels like to struggle financially, to hold a menial, meaningless job, or to doubt their own efficacy and purpose in a world that seems rigged toward the better-off, yet have anything meaningful or lasting to teach to those who do.

Is there an issue here? Or does Stoicism trade in truths so necessary and eternal that they transcend social divisions? Looking forward to some clarity from this most excellent of subs.",Stoicism,1632870587.0,t3_pxidoh,0.93,838
Understanding Fear & Anxiety,"Fear, like most every other emotion, is motivated by our assumptions, values, expectations and insecurities. If you were to stand on the edge of a cliff, there would be an alarm going off in your head reminding you to remain present and attentive in every step you take, to be more careful than you normally would be. The scenario of you slipping and falling is played out within your mind, you imagine the consequences and you feel even more fear at this moment because you know that it is possible.

This is the fear of your mortality becoming real to you, and a cliff is not required for it. This can happen because of a car nearly missing you or any other near-death situation, you enter into an area where there is a danger; you see the danger; you predict the outcome of an incautious action in face of the danger, and you in some part feel the emotional consequences of that action. You’ve never fallen off of a cliff, but if you stood atop a cliff and looked down, visualizing yourself falling, you would feel a small part of what you would feel if you actually were falling.

Despite the fact you are standing on solid ground, you feel the fall. You feel the fear of a situation before the situation happens. This is anxiety, to feel not what you should feel; but to anticipate what could go wrong, and to feel the results immediately. 

If anxiety is feeling something before it has occurred, and thus suffering the emotional consequences of actions which have never been taken, then the problem cannot be the situation, but rather our attitude and expectations regarding the problem.

An anxiety ridden young man might want to ask someone out on a date and reconsider because he has already decided he knows how the other person will answer, but how can he know? How can he be sure? His premeditation of what may happen keeps him from experiencing life and making decisions, If he continues in this way, he will live a life of complete and total indecision, and never be satisfied with any option given to him, for he will always see that something could go wrong.

This is the work of expectation, which anxiety needs in order to function, by eliminating expectation, anxiety ceases to make sense, and begins to crumble.

So how do we eliminate expectation? By examining it, and deciding whether our expectations are reasonable or, frankly, insane. Let us consider an example, you are walking down the street and trip, and as you stand up, you see a group of people laughing at you. Would this surprise you? Would this subvert your expectations about humanity? Why, exactly, have you not yet noticed that men can and will be spiteful and arrogant? Ignorant of their own flaws and yet critical of others. Would you also expect to not be shot at while at war? Yes, there are those that would help you up after you fall, yes there are those who would show you mercy in war, but you have lived in this world long enough to see both goodness and evil manifest itself, do you believe yourself immune to the effects of one and not the other? Take these words of Marcus Aurelius to heart,

>“When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they can't tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are unnatural.”

Your life will be impeded, you shall meet those who hold disdain for you for no reason, you will be beaten; physically or mentally, and at the end of it all, the earth will swallow you and you will be forgotten. The cliff is real, and you are destined to fall, again, and again, and again.

Expecting not to fall is irrational, as irrational as not expecting to die, or expecting never to be insulted. It is inevitable.

And that’s ok, it’s fine, there’s nothing wrong with falling, because as stated earlier.

>“Anxiety is feeling something before it has occured, and thus suffering the emotional consequences of actions which have never been taken, then the problem cannot be the situation, but rather our attitude and expectations regarding the problem.”

Just like the young man who fears approaching someone he feels affection for, we treat every problem life presents us with as something that will harm us, or reduce our stature, or inconvenience us. We refuse to look at life’s difficulties proportionately, and once we do, once we stare at it and inspect it, we begin to see that the fall isn’t as far as we thought, and that we could even manage to start climbing down if only we are careful and attentive. Once we realign our expectations, and view the world more proportionately, we see that maybe the fall isn’t so bad, maybe the consequences won’t be what we thought they would be, maybe even if they are, that isn’t so bad.

And this is why you must work to destroy your expectations, these insidious things which confine you and propagate more anxiety in your mind. Expect only what is observably true, and value only that which is under your control. For if you expect that you will keep all of your wealth, and a recession hits, you will be miserable. If you expect to become a runner, and your legs begin to rot, you will be miserable, but if you expect only one thing; that you will bear life’s difficulties as a good and virtuous man, then you shall forever be unperturbed. For no amount of wealth given or taken shall affect your virtue, your personhood, your ability to choose who you wish to be. Choice is, as Viktor Frankl said, the one thing that remains despite all circumstance,

>“We who lived in the concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms — to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.”

So your expectation must not revolve around circumstance or other’s actions, only your own. You shall free yourself of anxiety if only you do this, expect yourself to remain an upstanding and moral person regardless of what befalls you. If fate decides that you shall be a beggar, then be a good and kind beggar, give what you can when you can. If fate decides that you should lose an arm, bear the loss with the knowledge that your arm was not yours in the first place, it was given to you by nature and now it has returned to nature. You are not belongings, you are not your body, you are not what happens to you, you do not decide what fate shall do to you; you only decide how you respond to it. Fate will do what it wishes to you, you have no choice in this matter, but decide now whether you should fear the inevitable or accept it.

And as long as you place your value in this alone, what is there to fear? What event can bring anxiety to you if the only important thing, how you bear the event, is within your control?

Only the fear of failure remains, one source of anxiety, instead of the thousands you had previously, the fear that maybe you won’t do as you should, that you aren’t strong enough to be virtuous. 

The difference between this anxiety and the others is clear, it isn’t an anxiety which focuses on how events will unfold, but how you will respond to the events. 

This anxiety, while preferable to the other ones, is still not a productive one, for to live in fear that you will be unvirtuous suggests that you do not believe in your ability to be virtuous, and this shows that you do not believe in yourself.

Not only will this anxiety punish you when you fail to be virtuous, which we all do, it shall simply resurface later even if you are perfectly virtuous, questioning whether you’ll be able to be so virtuous next time. 

You must accept yourself, not as you wish to be, just as you are. You are unvirtuous, and you have failed, and you will be unvirtuous, and you will fail, but expecting yourself to not fail is again the source of your misery. You must accept yourself and come to terms with the fact that self improvement, becoming a better person, is not an easy path and you shan’t walk it easily. You must be satisfied with your efforts towards the goal, not the goal itself. The sage is an unattainable ideal, and that’s ok, because it is our efforts which count. It is the fact that we, heads bloody, arms tired, refuse to stop trying to be better, and love ourselves not for our perfection; but for our pursuit of it. I will reference a previous writing of mine, which focuses on the purity of effort. Consider these words, from Albert Camus,

>“I leave Sisyphus at the foot of the mountain. One always finds one's burden again. But Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is well. This universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night-filled mountain, in itself, forms a world. The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.”


Camus' philosophy operates in opposition to classical Stoicism, but what one extrapolates from the above quote is up to them. To Camus', the world being stripped of inherent meaning allowed him to place meaning where he wished. What I find quite Stoic about the above quote is Sisyphus' perceived attitude. The rock will always go up, and it will always go down, this is not within Sisyphus' control. However, the struggle towards the heights, the intention to move, the choice to act, this is what fulfills Sisyphus. Sisyphus refuses to place his value in the results of his actions, and instead embodies the Stoic ideal of acting dutifully, struggling towards a greater ideal, without expectation or worry for the result of those actions. The intention to be good is enough for Sisyphus, he cares not for success or failure, only that he continues in what he set out to do. And as Stoics that should be enough for us shouldn't it? I cannot control the ways of the world or how people react to my actions, I cannot even ensure that my actions have a true impact on the world, think of how many writings of the Stoics we have lost. Think of how they will be lost in time. Yet that wasn't important to the Stoics, they knew their efforts could be prevented by the world, they knew that anyone they helped would fall away into dust one day, but it wasn't about the results of their work; it was the intention behind it. Like Sisyphus' efforts, all the Stoics' efforts will one day be forgotten, we are lucky to have their writings now, but it's simply a matter of time before they are gone. But the Stoics, like Sisyphus, didn't concern themselves with what the results of their actions would be, they awoke with the intention to be good, and this was enough.

Today my boss yelled at me and it was...beautiful.,"I sort of felt like a sociopath, definitely like a stoic in the colloquial sense (emotionless, etc). Today my boss called my colleagues and I into a room, and he's your typical hothead manager. Since we get paid a pretty good salary, it isn't one of those situations where you can just walk out on the job and find another  the same day.   
     
That being said, I couldn't help but think of stoicism when the tirade began. First I thought of it as being voluntary discomfort, then I thought of Marcus Aurelius' *""the people I deal with today will be...""* quote. Then it began to feel surreal, as if I floated above the room and thought *""we'll all be dead in a 100 years and this specific moment in history will be as important as a bag blowing through the wind.""* There were even times I drifted off, imagining my boss as an actor in a movie where his role was to scream, and I was simply observing without being *personally* affected.  
    
 Even when my boss called on me, I sort of just, calmly explained the situation, what we'll do about the work issue, etc. It almost felt like a superpower.  The context of what was said is not important, it was just the feeling. I don't know if this sort of detachment is healthy but I thought I'd mention how stoicism has effected me in this specific circumstance.

Feeling guilty when I spend time on anything except strictly productive things.,"Stoicism seems to have made me into a workaholic, I feel guilty when I do unproductive things like playing games, watching movies and videos, using social media. 

At one hand, it makes sense. Why waste time doing unproductive things, when you could be studying, working, learning etc. On the other hand, working 24/7 for the rest of your life doesn't seem very appealing.

I tried to find the right balance, and it only feels right when I'm working all day long or else at the end of the day, when I go to sleep, I would feel I could have been more productive. Any advice is appreciated.

Read all the comments. From tomorrow, I'll be doing different activities (running, meditating, light exercise, reading, etc) to take a break, instead of addictive activities (games, social media, videos). Also will be setting an alarm, so that I know when to stop and get back to work.

"If you smile when you are alone, then you really mean it.","The more I grow up the more I realize that, to be happy, one needs to be able to live with himself. To be lonely.

I'm 23 years old, male, and in the last years I realized that people don't really care about what your dreams are, what are your ambitions, who you truly are. Most of them just want to see the results of your hard work, they don't care what you've done to accomplish your goals. They want the final product.

I think this is why most people suffer when they are alone, when they feel like they have no friends: it is because no one comprehends their thoughts. I believe that we, as humans, strive to be understood by others. We want to feel the relief of knowing that other people comprehend our feelings, our future projects. That other people are proud of what we are doing.

The reality of it all is, however, that only us, only within ourselves we know what we really are up to. No one can be proud of us more than ourselves, no one can love us more than ourselves. Other people come and go, friends of a lifetime are ready to turn their back on you anytime, if it is in their interests. The only true friend we have, is ourselves.

All of this doesn't mean that we should actively avoid people, I'm actually very extroverted: I love make people laugh and experience all the good sensations that come in staying in a group. But that's all there is to social life, the good feelings. In the end, after all the smiles, the kisses and the laughs, only the person you watch in the mirror every morning knows what's up with your life. Your true life.

Aristotle said: *Whosoever is delighted in solitude, is either a wild beast or a god.*

I then say to be your personal god, and to love yourself and your loneliness. Because that's all you really possess in this world.

This Is *Literally* A Self Help Forum At This Point.,"After joining her months ago, I soon realized this was not really a place to discuss stoicism, but more so a place for people to ventabout their issues, and ask the question ""How would a stoic deal with situation X?"" with various different situations.

I went ahead and counted all the posts that were simply asking for help on things sorting by new right now.

How to make good decisions and don't waste your time on crap. Lesson from a former slave.,"Hi fellows! I'd like to share with you a lesson from a stoic philosopher Epictetus that helped me to become way more productive and make better decisions. I've framed it from his perspective, so he is a teacher here. Wish you a good read!

# Dichotomy of Control Exercise

Hi, I am **Epictetus**. I was born a slave in the Roman Empire and was crippled later on in life. This was terrible fortune and not of my own doing.

But neither the shackles of my enslavement nor the limitations of my body made me feel limited. This might seem very strange to you, but let me explain.

Some things are within our complete control, while others are not. Within our control are judgment, desire, aversion, and whatever is of our own doing.

Not within our complete control are our body, our property, reputation, and whatever is not of our own doing.

That's because there are many external factors involved: illness, misinformation, and the impact of other people on us.

However, judgments and desires are internal to us, as we learned in the previous lessons.

But how should we deal with things like our health or our reputation? We can't really stop caring about them, but we can't guarantee that these things will turn out the way we want either.

We Stoics believe that we can't really fail in those things, as long as we are doing everything possible within our control. If they still go wrong, like due to you having an unexpected disease, it was not of your doing, so it's not a failure.

**Now, think of the last time you were afraid of failing, for example, public speech. How did you feel? How did it play out? Did you feel that you have complete control over the situation?**

We control far less than we might intially think, and we likely have mistaken ideas about what we control.

The problem is that by pursuing things that are not under control, we can't really control our happiness.

Let me give you an example.

It is like planning a sea voyage. What can you do? You can choose the captain, the sailors, the day, the right moment. Then a storm comes upon us. At this point, what are your concerns? Your part is done.

So choosing the captain was under your control, and weather conditions were not. So why would you even be bothered by the failure if it was not under your complete control?

What can you do in situations like that? Shift your goals from the external to the internal: repeat yourself that your objective is not to have a safe voyage but to do the best that is within your power to make it safe.

If you redirect your attention and desires in this fashion, you can't get disappointed that easily.

So let's do a quick exercise.

**Think of an important event you have soon. It might be a date or a public performance. What is under your control within this event? What is not?**

**Great. How can you focus more on things you control and pay less attention to something you can't?**

We should focus our energy and resources on affecting what we can control and turn away as much as possible from what we can't.

This boils down to the notion that we are in charge only and exclusively of our deliberate judgments, our endorsed opinions and values, and our decisions to act or not to act.

Nothing else.

I highly recommend doing this exercise daily, looking at specific events in your life. As you continue practicing, you'll internalize what is really under your complete control and what isn't.

\-------

P.S. If you liked this exercise, I have written more lessons like that. Just in case you **are curious to explore more**, let me know and I will share the link to **other lessons** in DM.

The themes I cover are: getting disciplined, reducing anxiety, learning about your life values, decision-making, the art of happiness, and being present in the moment.

The lessons are based on the primary sources of wisdom from more than 2500 years of history of philosophy: Plato, Aristotle, Lao Tzu, Carl Jung, Stoics, and many others.",Stoicism,1618402559.0,t3_mqpb19,0.99,817
Regrets are the biggest fallacy,"Regret is probably the biggest struggle I have had to face. 

All of us probably have regrets, things we wish we had done differently. Maybe we even obsess over it. But at the end of the day always remember that regrets are the biggest fallacy.

Obviously if you knew what you know now, than you would’ve made a different decision. Obviously if you knew at the time that you would hate your job, you wouldn’t have applied for it. Of if you knew at the time that you would get a ticket for speeding, you wouldn’t have sped.

But that’s the whole point, you never could’ve known. So rest assure that as much as you hate the decision you made, it was a decision that you chose to make which seemed right at the time.

"Marcus Aurelius Meditations (5.26) - Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional",">Make sure that the ruling and sovereign part of your soul remains unaffected by every movement, smooth or violent, in your flesh, and that it **does not combine with them**, but circumscribes itself, and restricts these experiences to the bodily parts. Whenever they communicate themselves to the mind by virtue of that other sympathy, as is bound to occur in a unified organism, you should **not attempt to resist the sensation**, which is a natural one, but you must **not allow the ruling centre to add its own further judgement** that the experience is good or bad. 

1. Something happens.  
2. You are struck by it, feeling a natural physical sensation (be it trembling, crying, nausea, tension, etc.).  
3. You recognize what happened and fully accept the physical sensations that arose, letting them come, stay the amount of time that they need to stay and leave on their own. This may take some time.  
4. Learn from the experience and move on.

I know, easier said than done. As someone who suffers from trauma, this is very hard for me to do. But I am trying to take it step by step, moment by moment. As a bonus: Loving-kindness meditation also helps!",Stoicism,1628182244.0,t3_oymhmm,0.99,816

"Today I got stuck in snow, dug my way out, and realized how far I’ve come since my battle with depression","I live in a place where it doesn’t snow often, but I’m close enough to the mountains to drive there whenever I want to hike and explore. I’m a big nature guy so I like to find solitude in the woods. 

What I wasn’t expecting when going into the mountains was the snow in parking lots/driveways/shoulders or anything that isn’t a paved road. As soon as I pulled into the park, I got stuck in snow, unable to go back or forward (I drive a small car with no snow tires). 

Realizing the predicament I got myself into, I immediately turned to stoicism. What’s in my control? Not a whole lot; the car is stuck on ice with snow blocking the wheels and bumpers, so I would either have to call a tow truck or have someone help push the car. What’s not in my control? Much more; no service, I’m alone, people aren’t stopping to help, no access to emergency services. Seeing my only option, I started digging.

At some point, I got tired, so I sat down and opened up Meditations. The first thing that caught my eye was this quote:

“That which is an obstacle in the road helps us on the road.” - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations 5

In the past, depression would have taken over, leaving me upset and frustrated and unmotivated. Stoicism has since helped me to change my mindset (along with therapy and other treatment). Why waste my energy being upset when I could use it to help my predicament? Why rely on some phony idea of help coming out of nowhere when I’m the only one who can help myself? Having a stronger mindset with better priorities for myself has definitely gotten me a long way. 

I’m still fairly new to this practice; I was turned onto the idea of stoicism and philosophy about a year ago and have slowly been arriving to new ways of thought. While this situation was quite literally an obstacle in the road, I have already found it helpful. Like I said, the changes in my thoughts and discipline have been tremendous thanks to stoicism.

I had a stoic success moment yesterday,"Yesterday while I was leaving the gym I backed up into another car in the parking lot. The parking is on a slope so I didn’t see it and left a dent on it. 

I was the only one in the parking lot at the time and nobody saw it happen and for a moment admittedly I considered just driving off, but I knew that the right thing to do was find the person and give them my information. 

I go into the gym to leave a note for the person since I didn’t want to cause a scene and when I went back to the parking lot the driver was entering her car and didn’t even notice the damage. 

I waived her down and told her what happened and exchanged insurance information. 

I know my rates will go up but it wouldn’t be fair for her to pay for my mistake.

Laid off from job yesterday,"I was laid off yesterday from my job of 7 years, completely out of the blue with no cause or explanation other than ""restructuring"". I tried to act as a model employee, even just received a shout out in a memo last week where I, direct quote: ""have set a great example of what we can all strive to achieve."" Fast forward one week and I find myself in my boss's office with my walking papers without so much as a reasonable explanation. 

If I were not a stoic, this would have greatly bothered me. I simply shrugged and said ""oh well"", and went on my way. In the past before discovering stoicism, I have gotten depression from something like this happening. It would have set me back months, trying to figure out what I did wrong, 'why me?', and devalued myself as a human being and my abilities, when in all reality this likely had nothing to do with my abilities and likely more to do with cost-cutting measures and me having a higher salary than most other employees there. 

This is a great example for me of how everything can change in an instant. I worked through the entire pandemic and thought that if my job was secure through all of it, there would be no way it wouldn't be safe now that things are picking back up and getting somewhat back to ""normal"". But life doesn't care about that. There are always factors outside of our control, and we can strive to do the very best in everything and literally have one factor that causes everything to collapse. Everything that mattered there suddenly doesn't matter anymore. All of the work I still had left to do, the colleagues I worked with and everything that I had planned are suddenly wiped out in an instant. And I love it. For the first time in my life, I am excited for losing my job. Stoicism has let me view this only as an opportunity for growth and a pathway to freedom.

I am going to relish the free time that I have now. I am going to use this time to further myself as a person and my skills as an employee. One practical way is to look up higher up postings for jobs I wish to aspire to, find common requirements and skills that I do not possess, and utilize my free time to teach myself these skill online to become a more well-rounded, knowledgeable and experienced candidate. The world is my oyster, so to speak, and I realize now how much I was holding myself back by working there long past the point where I stopped learning.

I was NOT stoic yesterday and I think it was the right choice,"In my journey through Stoicism, I try to step back often and look at things from an outside perspective. Yesterday I failed to do this and acted emotionally.

Without giving too much details, I work in IT and one of the most pleasurable things about my job is the amount of people I meet in different walks of life. I make it a point to work on the human relationship, as ultimately I believe it is the most important aspect in a work environment.

Long story short, we had a meeting with management and they wanted to take the human element out of equation ( or reduce it) .
I tried to act calm but I couldn’t. I called my manager out, argued that this was a bad idea, and drove home the point that our greatest advantage over competition is that we harness this human relationship with the client. I spoke with anger in my voice and sadly I couldn’t remain cool as I wanted. 

This however seemed to effect the management and even my colleagues, one of them ended up private messaging me and congratulated me on the words I used as in his words “ I said it better than he ever could”.

I admit, I would have loved to be the stoic dude, the one with the cool voice and the calm attitude, but I failed. I was angry and throbbing with adrenaline. Honestly I was a bit disappointed with myself ( in terms of Stoicism). I however acknowledge that when dealing with irrational beings, emotion can be a good medium as well. I think that Stoicism does not tell us to be robots and ignore our emotions, but to embrace our humanity. I think this experience was still a good lesson in the walk that is Stoicism.

‘Men are disturbed not by things but by the view that they take on them’ -Epictetus,"Others opinions about you are more of a reflection on them and their subconscious then you as a person, equally how you view others says more about who you are then who they are. It’s foolish to think you may know someone better then they know themselves, the truth is that no one can truly know themselves or others as the human mind is too complex. The complexity of the human mind (think psychoanalysis) means that no human can be good or evil as these labels are too blanket making hate is futile. To insult others when angry is not to insult them but to insult the person you believe they are. Your beliefs about others are not inherently a reflection of who they are but a reflection of the beliefs and ideals you attach to them.   This realisation is not pretty but kind of grotesque. Could it mean humans are incapable of pity? Take feeling sympathy for another persons circumstance, is that just you relating your own insecurities of being able to see yourself in similar situation? After all you will never be them and will never be able to feel their pain, your feeling of sympathy possibly speaks more to your own insecurities then to their situation. Ask yourself this, if you could never be in there situation, not even hypothetically would you still feel pity? Can anyone help me out with this, I feel like unsure if I’m upstanding this right. :)

Why is suicide bad?,"First of all let me make it clear that this question is just out of my curiosity and philosophy, I'm not depressed or anything. 

Now whenever people talk about suicide they tend to sugarcoat things(and for good reasons) but I always wonder, as far as human knowledge goes life doesn't have a purpose. No matter how much fun you have or how poor you are at the end everything vanishes. So why can't a person(who let's say is suffering and would have to work a lot to get out of misery) just end his life because either way he WILL die someday. 

People say that your family and loved ones will suffer but let's be honest does it really matter when you are dead? 

So I know this is a very sensitive topic but I would appreciate if you can give your opinion on this.

East of Eden is amazingly stoic,"This book is a masterpiece to me. I tear up thinking about it. I consider it one of the more modern narratives on Stoicism with a touch of everything else too: Nihilism, Absurdism, Existentialism etc. Steinbeck is one of my favorite authors. At one point in the book one of the characters fondly flips through Meditations.

Some quotes:

“You're going to pass something down no matter what you do or if you do nothing. Even if you let yourself go fallow, the weeds will grow and the brambles. Something will grow.”

“We have only one story. All novels, all poetry, are built on the neverending contest in ourselves of good and evil. And it occurs to me that evil must constantly respawn, while good, while virtue, is immortal. Vice has always a new fresh young face, while virtue is venerable as nothing else in the world is.”

“I believe that there is one story in the world, and only one, that has frightened and inspired us, so that we live in a Pearl White serial of continuing thought and wonder. Humans are caught - in their lives, in their thoughts, in their hungers and ambitions, in their avarice and cruelty, and in their kindness and generosity too - in a net of good and evil. I think this is the only story we have and that it occurs on all levels of feeling and intelligence. Virtue and vice were warp and woof of our first consciousness, and they will be the fabric of our last, and this despite any changes we may impose on field and river and mountain, on economy and manners. There is no other story. A man, after he has brushed off the dust and chips of life, will have left only the hard, clean questions: Was it good or was it evil? Have I done well - or ill?”

“The Hebrew word, the word timshel - 'Thou mayest' - that gives a choice. It might be the most important word in the world. That says the way is open...Why, that makes a man great...He can choose his course and fight it through and win...I have a new love for that glittering instrument, the human soul.

"About a week ago, the post ""Youtube's algorithm brings me this blessing gift"" featured advice on allowing others to not like you. I loved it so much that I transcribed the video so that I could place a copy on my wall. Here is that transcription if you'd like to do the same.","Not everyone is going to like you. Not everyone is going to accept you, or appreciate you. In fact, there will be many who dislike you, who will judge you, criticise you, and that's just the way it is. You can't please everyone.

Now certainly, we should be considerate of others. We should be respectful, and we should be watchful of our own behaviour, and if someone criticises us, it may be worth reflecting upon it to see if perhaps there is something we may need to address in our behaviour. But even if you're the kindest, gentlest, sweetest, most respectful person on the planet, there's simply going to be those who will find all kinds of reasons not to like you, and you just have to accept that. 

What I've found to be a really powerful piece of advice is to simply allow others the freedom not to like you, to allow them the freedom to disagree with you, to judge you, to think less of you. After all, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, even if that opinion is entirely baseless. But by allowing them to dislike you, what you're actually doing is recognising that they don't need your permission, they're going to do it whether you permit them to or not. But what you're actually doing is letting go of the need to control what others think, because you can't control that. If someone doesn't approve of you, the way you are, you can perhaps try to change some aspect of yourself in order to win their approval, but chances are they'll just find something else to criticise, because that's just what they do, they just like to critisise. So no matter what you do, they're likely going to find something to criticise, so forget about it. And even if you can win their approval, there's just going to be someone else who doesn't approve, and you'll never please everyone. 

So just allow others to have their opinions. You don't have to agree with them, you don't have to accept what they say, all you're doing is recognising that they have the right to think whatever they want to think. All you're doing is respecting that freedom, and it's such a liberating thing when you begin to do this, when you give up needing to have other people's approval, or needing to control what others think of you. You find your own freedom in that. And what you also find is that most people who don't like you are really struggling to like themselves. They may be deeply miserable; bitter. But as soon as you let go of the need for them to like you, you find a certain level of peace in that, and they can say whatever they want, and it only affects them, it doesn't have to affect you at all. You just go on with your life, doing what you do, and don't be bothered by it. 

What's important is whether or not you like you, whether or not you accept yourself, whether or not you appreciate yourself, and none of that should depend on what anyone else thinks. You have to see that for yourself. And when you do, you stop caring what other people think, and life is so much more pleasant that way. You become free to do so much more, to do what you feel passionate and inspired to do, to share your gifts, your creativity, your compassion. And anyone who doesn't appreciate that? That's their loss. You let them worry about that.

Marcus Aurelius on getting out of bed,"Recently I've had trouble finding the motivation to get out of bed, I looked to this quote by Marcus Aurelius

At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: “I have to go to work — as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for — the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?”

But the part about ""I have to go to work"" is what I'm having trouble with, I do not have a job despite applying to any available ones I can find, I am waiting to hear back. I've also looked at volunteer positions but they are all so far away from my town. Most of my daily time is therefore spent exercising, cleaning the house, or practising skills like guitar, the rest of my time is just leisure and I feel like I'm wasting it. It is hard to apply Marcus' quote when my ""work"" is non-existent, I still think it's a very good quote regardless.",Stoicism,1621174688.0,t3_ndpab8,0.99,773

I just finished Madeline Miller’s book Circe, about the enchantress/minor goddess in Greek mythology, told from her own perspective. It really struck me as a Stoic journey, beginning with her futile attempts to gain the appreciation & respect of other gods. She acts emotionally (eg. Permanently turning her sister into a monster over a romantic dispute). During her exile she comes to see the error of her ways, and understands that despite being mistreated, abused and imprisoned, she can still be the master of her own destiny. The book ends with Circe taking one of her own “true form” potions, which she knows will take away her immortality. 

She chooses a mortal life over an immortal existence, which is the context of the above quote.

Stoics advise to go for long walks alone and it helps.,"Today i was feeling quite sad and lonely because i had a tough breakup a few weeks ago and i was planning to just sit at home and play games all day but i decided to follow the stoic advice and go for a long walk with my dog and enjoy nature, be social and to put my thoughts in check and i was surprised how effective it is.

I saw couples everywhere enjoying eachother and i was happy for them. I saw couples crying and arguing because valentines day didnt go how they hoped. I saw ex lovers crossing paths and shouting passive agressive things at eachother. I had small interactions with random people who wanted to pet my dog.

I got home feeling like my issues were nothing. Just a simple walk to make me see how everyone like Marcus says goes through the same cycles and pain and its just part of nature.

Life changing abstract by Viktor Frankl’s ‘Man’ search for meaning’,"‘What was really needed was a fundamental change in our attitude toward life. We had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that _it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us._ We needed to stop asking the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life- daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk or meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.’

'A tale of two monks' and a lesson about virtue ethics,"I happened upon this story today on [kottke](https://kottke.org/20/01/the-story-of-two-monks-and-a-woman):

>The tale of two monks and a woman is a well-known Buddhist parable. The story goes that two monks were traveling together, a senior and a junior. They came to a river with a strong current where a young woman was waiting, unable to cross alone. She asks the monks if they would help her across the river. Without a word and in spite of the sacred vow he’d taken not to touch women, the older monk picks her up, crosses, and sets her down on the other side.

>The younger monk joins them across the river and is aghast that the older monk has broken his vow but doesn’t say anything. An hour passes as they travel on. Then two hours. Then three. Finally, the now quite agitated younger monk can stand it no longer: “Why did you carry that women when we took a vow as monks not to touch women?”

>The older monk replies, “I set her down hours ago by the side of the river. Why are you still carrying her?”

The author's comment - ""the story is a reminder to not dwell on the past in a way that interferes with living in the present moment"" - is certainly correct, but I see a second meaning here as well.

The older monk physically touched the woman, but with proper intent. He understood the prohibition was not about touching per se, but about avoiding desire and attachment. It's not the act itself, it's  the reason and the intent that matter.

Ironically, the younger monk did become attached, and found himself clinging to an unimportant thing,  allowing it to unsettle him. The younger monk assented to _being touched_ by the encounter with the woman, in a way that the older monk avoided.",Stoicism,1580058002.0,t3_eu99oe,1.0,763

I really feel like I've found something that works for me. This is a great community.,"Stoicism makes me so comfy. Nothing has ever made me feel this way, truly. This community is amazing, and while there aren't many stoics in our personal lives that we can talk to, we have each other over the internet. Stoic quotes are so beautifully said. Everything just feels right, truly. I appreciate everyone here, because we're all making a contribution toward each other's journey in stoicism. Such a realistic, chill philosophy. Unrelated, but today I experienced something quite beautiful. I was watching a documentary series about how math/numbers influence this universe and how everything fits so remarkably well together. There was a scene where they were discussing constellations, stars etc. Something about looking at space makes me shift into this perspective that is so peaceful. I accept everything as it is, there's just this understanding and appreciation for life that, admittedly, I do not usually have. I should look at the stars more often.

"I'm Greek, raised and living in Greece.

For a long enough time now ""it is what it is, life moves forward"" has been my main quote dealing with everything from inconveniences to even tragedy, yes we mourn but we cannot stop progressing in life sadly.

Anyway today I happened to stumble upon a video about ""Stoicism"" with the title ""Stoicism: The Art Of Not Caring"" I almost brushed it off as I already practice this most of the time but the setting and all seemed interesting so I said since I got nothing else to watch I'm gonna shoot it a shot might as well.

Surprised to find out it's basically my mentality and my way of thinking, not only this  but it originates from my country's ancestors.

But, I am 100% certain this has not **ONCE** been mentioned in a history book here, I think the why is obvious, they do not want people to be oblivious, they want us to be stressed so we work as we're told.

We all know we're taught what they want to teach us, censor or even overwrite history, but I felt like this had to be mentioned here.

Stoicism goes against most of society because they want people to be stressed, worrying and struggling.

Observations of a Dying Stoic - Part 7,"Long overdue for an update, I know. But then you stoics should really have no expectations. :)

Those that have been following know that I really only post as I think I have something to share that may be of interest or benefit to others. I am coming up on 2 years since I created this account and started posting in January of 2021. I don't really know how long ago my last post was and am not really that motivated to go back and check.

I am still fighting the cancer. I stopped chemotherapy Aug of 21 and was stable until this last June. At that time we discovered some tumor growth in the liver, although the pancreatic tumor and the bone cancer have remained stable. During the break I took from chemo I followed a pretty aggressive natural/off label approach to fighting the cancer and lived my life pretty much as normal.

The reason that we found new growth is that I developed a breathing problem starting in May of this year. One night I spent my time in bed gasping for air. This has been building up over time and I assumed maybe a side effect of my Covid19 from November of 21. I got up about 4am, told my wife I was driving to the ER and would see her in a couple of hours. Ha, talk about having no expectations. I thought I'd get a little Broncho dilatator and get sent home. No such luck. Was a P.F.O, which is basically a hole in your heart. I won't bore you with the details, Dr. Google can guide you if you are so inclined.  So 8 days in the hospital and all is well, mostly. What's significant about the event is that 1) we found new tumor growth in the liver, which didn't really phase me, and 2) a rerun of the situation when I was first diagnosed.

I was just cruising along in the hospital when the Surgeon came in to discuss the impending operation. First words out of his mouth is that ""*this is no walk in the park. There is a distinct possibility that we close the hole in your heart and your right side goes into cardia arrest. At that point there would be very little we could do to fix it, so dying during the operation is a real and not insignificant risk here*.""

Wow. Talk about deja vu all over again. After my initial diagnosis it took a few weeks but I really did come to terms and accept my fate, so to speak. Here we were again and I'm suddenly struck again by a potentially more impending death sentence and many of the same emotions. I realized that I had become somewhat complacent about the situation and had pushed my impending doom almost completely out of my mind. That was actually a great feeling upon some reflection. It assured me that I was focused on the living and not on the dying. I was somewhat surprised about my reaction to being told I might not survive the surgery, but the processing time from shock to acceptance this time was amazingly short, hours really. Something to ponder.

While we're on the topic of expectations, I think I previously mentioned my best friend from childhood passing away last October. The estate has been going through some court battles and is  now in probate. The pubic administrator for the county in which my friend lived was appointed as executor and was proceeding with the business of protecting the estate and getting estimates, determining who gets what based on the will, etc. One of the things bequeathed to me was the contents of his house. The house and property are going to a charity, but he wanted me to have his other possessions. The property is somewhat remote and sits on 12 or so acres.

So to protect the property the administrator boarded up the house, installed some cameras for remote monitoring and went about their business. What they failed to do was turn off the water to the residence. I don't really have to explain what happened next, do I? Didn't think so. Anyway, the leak went undetected for long enough in a boarded up house that virtually everything in the house that is not glass or stainless was completely destroyed by toxic mold. There were a lot of memories in there. Board games we played as children, books that we exchanged, pictures and gifts we had exchanged over the years - all gone.

I have handled it well, but my kids are now mourning all over again. They were expecting to be able to visit his place once again and claim some items of sentimental value, get some sort of closure. I am heading over in a couple of  weeks but I will have to wear a hazmat suit to enter. I will also have to negotiate with the public administrator regarding their total failure on their fiduciary duty. (If anyone knows a good probate lawyer in California, hit me up.)

So to close out, here are some things I am taking away from this latest period.

1. Recognize that death may be around the corner, but continue to engage with the living world as before, albeit with more grace and compassion.
2. Expectations are evil and only lead to pain and anguish if not managed correctly.
3. I did restart chemo over the last six weeks and have now realized that I am done with it. I will not live out my last days as a walking zombie. I want to stay engaged with my family, chase my granddaughters around the back yard, play catch, etc. and not just have them remember me as the old guy that was always in bed or too exhausted to engage. I'll continue the battle, but with options that do not kill me faster than the disease. However it turns out I am happy for the outcome and the chance to reassess how I was living before it was too late.

Philosophy is not a pill,"This post is directed at folks who are relatively new to Stoicism, or to philosophies of life in the abstract, and have a habit of asking for one-off solutions to ephemeral problems. I have noticed a few posts here that seem to betray a fundamental misunderstanding of the utility of Stoicism as a framework for living, which I would like to address. I apologize in advance for my excessive reliance on metaphors and analogies as rhetorical devices. I just really, really like them.

**Philosophy, especially Stoicism, is not a pill.** It is not medicine that you take when you are feeling ill. It is neither your lawyer, nor your tax specialist, nor your travel agent. It is not a taxi that you hail on a whim to carry you a few blocks down the road. It is not a tool that you pull off the shelf when you need to fix something, nor is it an umbrella that sits in your closet until the rainy season.

The recurrent fallacy we see so often is that some poor soul, anguished by their shortcomings or circumstances, believes they can be cured if only they receive the right quote or technique for dealing with it. While I truly wish to assist such individuals, I can't help but feel they are missing the point. Even those that are actively practicing Stoic principles, when confronted with mental anguish or adversity, can be so quick to assume that they must be missing something; something simple, actionable, and **easy.**

Consider the story of the renowned wrestler of antiquity, Milo of Croton. Milo was fabled to have possessed the strength to carry a fully grown ox on his shoulders. It is said that he achieved this by starting when that ox was but a newborn calf, no larger than a child. Day after day, year after year, Milo continued to hoist the calf upon his shoulders until it slowly grew into a hulking behemoth, and his strength with it. He did not simply resolve one day to learn how to lift a fully grown ox. He obtained this ability through daily practice, gradually conditioning him to achieve such a feat.

Please know that I bear you no ill will, and do not wish to belittle or alienate you. I do not wish to discourage you from seeking guidance, I merely wish to help you seek better guidance. There is no shortage of people who will gladly entertain a simple request for an inspirational quote or axiom. Indeed, this can even be quite productive at times!

Then, you must repeatedly implement the [practices](https://donaldrobertson.name/2013/02/20/introduction-to-stoicism-the-three-disciplines/) of the philosophy. These actions will serve to prepare you for a lifetime of adversity, rather than to pacify some temporary suffering.

Through study you will learn that the practice of Stoicism is really quite simple, much like Milo's early task of lifting the ox in its infancy. In fact, the practice is less about what you do, and more about what you *refrain* from doing. Nonetheless, it is a futile exercise if you only partake once in awhile. Don't just sip from the river, swim in it. It is the only way to achieve lasting tranquility.

**Understand this:** Stoicism is not a pill, it is a practice. It is a seed that you plant, water, and nurture, until it grows into a bountiful vine from which you harvest a good life. And best of all, with the proper care, it can grow in the most infertile soil, under the harshest conditions.",Stoicism,1597891309.0,t3_id24wi,0.97,751

Has anyone found benefit in deleting some or all of their social media accounts?,"This isn’t so much a stoic question, but I’m generally interested in people’s opinions on social media. 

I understand it serves a purpose. Has anyone however benefited from deleting Instagram, Facebook etc? Has doing so helped you on whatever journey you are on? 

I find this interested as social media is so ingrained on all of us. I am 24 and remember getting my first social media accounts (MSN and Bebo) aged 11. It is kinda crazy to think I have probably indulged in socially media most days for the last 13 years. That is over half of my life. 

Sorry if this sounds random but I would love to hear your experiences. Have you gained power over your life after removing social media? Or have you maybe lost contact and felt disconnected from the world/people?

Why we should all learn to refrain from obsessing over what people might think of us - a thought I had today.,"I was outside mowing my yard today and as a result of my allergies being bad this time of year, had to wear a quite silly looking mask to be able to breathe properly. Having neurotic tendencies, I started creating self inflicted feelings of being judged or seen as stupid whenever someone would walk past me, or a car would drive by. Having recently stumbled into Stoic Philosophy, I caught myself doing so, and started analyzing just how silly and illogical I was being. The main question I was asking myself to put it simply: is the judgement I am inflicting upon myself actually happening, and if it is, why should I care? That lead to the thought below.

**Do not obsess over what you believe others could be thinking of you, as you would not concern yourself with the attention of a bird. A bird has no thoughts; thus it is illogical to get emotionally attached to the concept of the bird’s judgement or opinion of you. Yet, you do not know with absolute certainty that the person judging you has thoughts either. And if they do have thoughts, why assume they would spend time thinking of you, or that it matters? Do not concern yourself with such uncertainties, for you will then allow your paranoia to become a Tyrant over your life. You would not welcome with open arms an external Tyrant, so why tolerate a Tyrant of your own making?**

Bear with me if the bird analogy doesn't really make sense. As I was mowing, I came to realize that I didn't concern myself with the thoughts of the birds looking at me, so what really is the difference between a bird and a human? Obviously we are different; we can think, we can interact at a deeper level. But when it comes to judgement, why concern myself with either of them, for I control neither.

How long are you going to wait before you demand the best for yourself? - Epictitus,"Saw this quote today from stoicreflections. Had to get the full passage to reflect on this.

“How long are you going to wait before you demand the best for yourself and in no instance bypass the discriminations of reason? You have been given the principles that you ought to endorse, and you have endorsed them. What kind of teacher, then, are you still waiting for in order to refer your self-improvement to him? You are no longer a boy, but a full-grown man. If you are careless and lazy now and keep putting things off and always deferring the day after which you will attend to yourself, you will not notice that you are making no progress, but you will live and die as someone quite ordinary.
From now on, then, resolve to live as a grown-up who is making progress, and make whatever you think best a law that you never set aside. And whenever you encounter anything that is difficult or pleasurable, or highly or lowly regarded, remember that the contest is now: you are at the Olympic Games, you cannot wait any longer, and that your progress is wrecked or preserved by a single day and a single event. That is how Socrates fulfilled himself by attending to nothing except reason in everything he encountered. And you, although you are not yet a Socrates, should live as someone who at least wants to be a Socrates.” 

It’s exactly what I needed to hear to remind myself that the contest is NOW. Honestly, it made me anxious at first like ugh I do have to take action now LOL (I’m a 6 in enneagram and you can’t just tell a 6 to jump). I’m not comfortable taking risks and I’ll “jump” when I know for sure it’s safe when it comes to making big life decisions (with people, it’s easy I’m confrontational and a counter-phobic 6). I usually doubt myself, my skills, and the progress I’ve made thinking I need to do more, learn more, plan more, and to talk to more people before taking any action. Simply because I’m afraid to make a mistake. This quote reminded me that it’s fine and nothing will improve if I don’t just go for it. Practice works but it needs to get tested to see if it does work. Mistakes are the great teachers in life and if I don’t try, the result will always be a failure.",Stoicism,1629911146.0,t3_pbfj5x,1.0,754
"Used to be anti-work, now I find fulfillment in doing my best.","(Edit added to the bottom)

Before I really started to read into Stoicism and other stoic-inspired literature, I was very cynical about work. This applied to School, my job, chores, etc.

But it was when I stumbled upon a quote from Marcus Aurelius that my perspective started to change.

“At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: “I have to go to work—as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for— the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?"" (**Marcus Arelius, Meditations, Book 2.1**)

Something about that quote really struck a nerve with me, and so I sat on it and it kept coming to mind whenever I was about to do any kind of work. I know the quote itself is about getting out of bed in the morning, but the specific line: ""What do I have to complain of, if I'm going to do what I was born for ... ""

To me now, I have accepted my work, of all kinds, as an opportunity to do my best. And that mindset has totally shifted my attitude, my relationships, my work ethic (obviously). It's almost been a catalyst for my personal change.

Another thing that's helped is the mantra: *Memento Mori, 'Remember you will die'* which Ryan Holiday mentions quite a bit. So I've coupled these two things together to give myself this reminder: **You can die at any time, so would you rather die knowing you did your best? Or would you rather die complaining about things you could not change?**

Maybe I'm just coping lol, but this reminder has been greatly impactful in my life. Thought I might share it with you all.

Edit: Did not expect this to blow up when I typed this up last night lol. I'm glad to see some discussion going on though, and want to address a counter-point to my post. Which is that working a corporate or retail job isn't want we are born to do. And while that may be true for some of you, I know a handful of former co-workers who absolutely love working their retail jobs. One of which has multiple degrees, and on the matter he simply says ""I'm a people person, it's what I do best."" So while it may not seem like it, some people just fit right in to their jobs. 

But for everyone else who work awful jobs? Well, I know not everyone has the opportunity to do so, but you can try to better yourself and work towards a better position, one more suited to your skills. For that is something that some of us *can* control! But I understand that is a complex discussion, and not everyone has equal opportunity. But something we can all do? Is our best. Whether you're working at McDonald's or as a programmer. Whether you're a student or a full-time parent.

“Stoics”,"I’m sick of seeing internet “entrepreneurs” and  “life coaches” tout around stoicism as some ancient secret method to get rich and be a super successful business guy. Stoicism has always emphasized humility and modesty. The main reason I got into Stoicism was because it teaches us to work hard and prioritize logic over emotion, while still maintaining the same views of ourselves no matter what our successes and failures are. 

Success doesn’t matter in Stoicism. Failure doesn’t matter either. What matters is remaining virtuous and logical through the struggles of life which will eventually lead to a deeper sense of fulfillment. But I still see these videos on YouTube titled something like “7 stoic tips that will CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!!!”, and when I click on it, I’m treated to a 12 minute video where some financial guru regurgitates basic Stoic concepts, and an ad plays every 2 minutes (not including the 4 times the guy making the video mentions his new book, or product, or sponsor).

I know I shouldn’t be upset about this, and I probably wouldn’t be if these people weren’t clearly trying to gain virality and sell products by teaching people about “Stoicism”. It gives new Stoics the wrong idea of what the philosophy is about and it exploits and, in my opinion, disgraces I the entire school of thought.

I’ve been getting back into Stoicism recently after spending time in quarantine and not really thinking much about it, so I went to Andrew Kirby’s channel, one of the first people who really got me into Stoicism. It seems to me like he’s started to go down the same path. That’s what inspired me to make this post.

Anyway I just wanted to know what other Stoics think about this. Do you guys agree, or am I completely wrong about this? I personally don’t think it’s right, or smart, to pursue economic success as a goal, so I may be projecting my own personal values onto stoicism, and if this is case let me know. Either way though, these entrepreneur types seem to make up a large demographic of modern Stoics, so I think it should be discussed.",Stoicism,1593902542.0,t3_hlc7os,0.98,749

Rilke's work often has a Stoic flavor, and this particular line from one of his letters to the young poet, Kappus, really expresses the idea of *Amor Fati* well. It was a fortunate coincidence that I discovered it when I did.

I, like a lot of others all over the world, have been going through some difficult times as of late, and was struggling with accepting my fate and not imposing judgements on it. I spent so much time, wishing for things to be as I wished them to and fantasizing about the way I wanted things to be happening. I finally came to grips with the futility of asking, ""why me?"", and realized a more pertinent question would be, ""why *not* me?"". We rarely, if ever, ask ""why me?"" when something that we judge to be good happens to us. Why? Because, of course we deserve it, we are special and unique and eminently worthy of whatever good fortune the universe sends our way. But, the truth is, there is nothing special about any of us that exempts us from fate. Fortune does not run hot and cold, it does not favor one over another; it simply *is*. There is no ""good"" fortune or ""bad"" fortune, only fortune - the good and the bad that we perceive are only our judgement of our fate. We could just as easily judge differently, or not at all.

Even animals know how to sleep. And it’s the characteristic activity that’s the more natural one—more innate and more satisfying.

\- Marcus Aurelius, Meditations 8.12 (translation by Gregory Hays)

Amazing that a Roman emperor talks about struggling to get out of bed. Who would have thought. But that aside, there are two things here that I have trouble understanding:

1. He considers working together as a defining human characteristic. Does he think only humans do this? Many animals - e.g. wolves, apes and orcas - hunt in packs, which I would consider ""working together"".

2. It was my understanding that the Stoics consider reason, the ability to act rational, as the one quality that separates man from beast. Does Marcus have a broader definition? Or does he see cooperation as an execution of reason?",Stoicism,1619091412.0,t3_mw2sf0,0.98,744

If the latter, ask yourself if letting this go is a price you can pay to maintain your peace of mind. Quite often you will find the price is not so great.

I cant believe that this is happening. This was always something you heard happen to others. Never to you or yours. 

I am still in disbelief. I dont know what to do. I want to cry. I'm a 29 year old guy. Some days I feel I am 10, and today especially so. I have been a stoic practitioner, but it's one thing to be stoic when your boss is being difficult, and another thing when life hangs in the balance.

I have and am doing all the things necessary, (going to the doc, preparing finances, even went in to work). 

But in those lonely moments, while waiting in line, while walking to the store, it hits me. The things that may happen, the worst. And Stoicism goes out of the window.

"When in doubt, act like The Rock.","*""Be like The Rock that the waves keep crashing around. It stands unmoved and the raging of the sea falls around it."" Marcus Aurelius, Meditations 4.49*

Many of us may know Marcus Aurelius as a philosopher, an emperor, or something in between. What he is rarely acknowledged for is his skill as a prophet, and no where is this more on display than this passage in Meditations. 

Despite being born thousands of years before Dwayne Johnson (The Rock), Marcus knew what a cultural force and icon he would be, and so he advises us in Meditations to strive to be more like him.

But what does this mean? Are we to model is vigorous workout routine, and remain consistent in our pursuit for physical fitness regardless of the day? Or is the lesson here more broad, in that we should seek to replicate his tireless work ethic when it comes to his career. Perhaps. 

I believe that the lesson here is even more specific, and has to do with the roles the Rock has chosen to play...

# The Rundown & Walking Tall (2004):

If one of your friends were to use the bathroom, and you switched the movie from one of these to the other about 85% of people wouldn't be able to tell the difference, so we'll group these two together. 

In both films The Rock plays a loose cannon tough guy who doesn't play by the rules. Now admittedly this goes against the Stoic principle of remaining calm and not being a slave to one's anger. However, I think the lesson that Marcus expected us to take from these films is the Rocks ability to remain unwavering and collected under pressure. 

In the Rundown The Rock sneaks into a Brazilian mining town, like a spy, to rescue Stiffler and in Walking Tall he fights another man with a goddamn axe. If sneaking into an enemy camp, or fighting with an axe don't qualify as situations that require some level of serenity - frankly I don't know what does. 

At the end of Scorpion King (2002) - which almost made the list - The Rock's love interest tells him that she foresees a period of peace and prosperity coming that would not last forever. What could be more stoic advice then to appreciate the good times, but to understand that they are just as temporary as everything else. 

# The Tooth Fairy (2010)

In this 2010 classic The Rock plays the Tooth Fairy after stealing a dollar from his girlfriend's daughter that was meant for the Tooth Fairy. While this film may have been slammed by critics for being ""unacceptably dull"" it's likely that they just didn't get the nuance beyond this screenplay.

Life is difficult, however turning into the Tooth Fairy overnight is a tall order even for someone as tall as the Rock. Throughout the course of the film Dwayne attempts to take short cuts, and is accused by his Tooth Fairy boss that he has an inability to be optimistic which is his biggest flaw. 

\*\*Spoilers\*\*

It's only when he accepts his responsibility for his own actions and embraces his roll as a Rock that stands unmoved amongst the raging fairies that he's able to get his life back in order for the sake of his new family. 

Marcus, whose arguably largest failing, was the behavior of his son Commodus, likely was referencing the Tooth Fairy as a means for rectifying his own mistakes.

# Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017)

What would you do if you were transported into the avatar of your favorite video game character? This is the existential question that Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle wrestles with WWE style. 

3 lives is all the cast has at their disposal, yet they are faced with life threatening circumstances at ever turn.  Whether it's poisonous snakes, hungry hungry hippos, or Kevin Hart's napoleon complex, the cast is put in harms way at nearly every moment of the film's run time. 

Being stuck in an alien environment with people, and facing as much danger as they do would be enough to make anyone question their involvement. Yet the Rock, in true Dwayne Johnson fashion, puts the team on his insanely proportioned back and delivers textbook leadership, cunning, and an example for how we too can live up to Stoic Principles. 

Sure, the team helped, and he even enlisted a Jonas brother who turned out to be a creepy version of Tom Hank's son, but none of it would have happened if The Rock didn't take Marcus advice and act like a rock. 

# Conclusion:

From Moana to Hobbs & Shaw there are no shortage of examples we can select to illustrate why The Rock was Marcus' choice for carrying the Stoic torch for future generations. Whether it's the mob, super soldiers, giant gorillas, or an earthquake like in San Andreas the Rock remains a Rock when the waters get rough.

Who else practices cold showers?,"I’ve only recently begun taking a cold shower every morning, in combination with some breathing techniques beforehand. The last few days has been a test of my mental will and resilience - I’m slowly finding that although my body reacts to the cold, it is for me to choose to be cold. It’s been a great experience so far, and I’ll be continuing on. 

I meditate after the experience each morning, and I’m finding this is the most mentally resilient I have ever been. Does anyone do this? How has it helped you?",Stoicism,1597354173.0,t3_i98qih,0.97,734
Moving on from breakup,"My ex-girlfriend of two years left me last Sunday and it was so painful. I thought we were going to spend our lives together. At first, I freaked out and pleaded for her to return, which never ends well. Then I clung to the hope that she would eventually miss me if I cut her off. Clinging to that allowed me to get through the first few days and be productive, which is already putting my life in a better place. 

It comes in waves but I find that when I feel low, focusing on improving my situation pushes me through. And when I’m feeling the high, I visualize her leaving forever, and moving on to someone else, because I can handle those thoughts during these moments. I think this is working to pull me out of the darkness, but not run away and bury the pain. It’s only been a few days and I can already feel myself letting her go, without it ripping me apart. 

It’s almost unsettling to see how easy it is to move on if we allow ourselves to. We’re so resilient and adaptable. Life keeps going forward, our nature doesn’t want to hold on, it wants to move forward too. Open up to new experiences and never hold onto negativity. Accept what comes our way and make the best of it that we can. Memento Mori. I think it’s important to remind ourselves of this, because it seems to be helping me. It’s hard but the only way is through, and I’m beginning to see the light at the end of this nightmare. Just wanted to share this if anyone else is feeling lost. Coincidentally, I came across stoicism just a few days before she dumped me. I still have a long way to go but it’s really helped me accept this and keeping moving forward.",Stoicism,1592590774.0,t3_hc5u0x,0.97,738

Today I returned my cat,"About 8 months ago I was driving and heard some faint meowing. I parked my car and went to look for the source, and I found the smallest, cutest kitten. From that moment on she became a member of my family and she brought us so much joy every day. For 8 months I was allowed to love her, to play with her, to watch her grow and to make memories with her. And today I had to return her.

She suddenly became very sick yesterday and after taking her to the emergency vet it was clear that she wasn't going to make it. An aortic thromboembolism, said the vet. Her back legs were completely paralyzed and she was in a lot of pain, and despite the vet's best efforts she wasn't responding to any of the pain medication. It all happened so fast. My husband and I had to decide between taking her to a vet hospital an hour away and allowing her to suffer through all the medical treatments with a minimal chance of survival, or euthanazing her. It wouldn't be fair to make her suffer any more than she already had.

I screamed. I cried. I cursed the heavens. ""It's not fair. Why is this happening? I'm not ready to let her go. She's just a baby. Just a baby. How can I go on after this?"" I threw myself to the floor, pleading she would miraculously jump up and be better. Anyone who's ever experienced the loss of a pet knows how painful it is. But despite me not being ready, it happened anyway. The cart was dragging me along and here I am, kicking and screaming like the last time I lost a pet. And then I remembered that I am not losing her, I am returning her. She was never mine to keep to begin with. I got to experience her love and affection, her presence, for 8 months. And though I wanted it to be so much longer, and make a 1000 more memories with her, instead of grieving what I was never promised, I can be grateful that our paths crossed for 8 beautiful months.

I hurt, oh I hurt. But I also feel a sense of peace. There is nothing I can do to stop death, it is not within my control. The time I've spent practicing stoicism allows me to meet this hardship with more grace than I thought I would be able to. So I will grieve, but not more than is needed, for I can look back at 8 months of memories and those will stay with me for as long as I am alive.

Thank you Mishi, for allowing me to love you, and loving me in return. And though I will cry, I will also honor your memory and smile as I think of you.",Stoicism,1679274445.0,t3_11w3vtz,0.96,731
A Meditation on Memento Mori,"Everything dies.

No matter how massive, how strong, how adaptive.  No matter how famous, how timeless, how immutable.  Everything dies.

From the big bang to the heat death of the universe, one through line weaves itself across the stars and in our lives: entropy, decay.  Even Marcus' rock standing against the raging sea erodes with time.  Even the most mythic heroes and foes of legend fade into oblivion.  Everything dies.

Yet death and decay, while constant, is not cause for despair.  Yes, one day humanity will forget you.  One day the earth will forget humanity.  One day the sun will forget the earth.  One day, the universe will forget the stars.  And yet, we continue to live and love and thrive.  No matter how fleeting, no matter how futile, the stars still shine and we still rise to meet them.  Everything dies.

So what if everything dies?  Do we stand, an unmoving but sea-battered and windswept stone, until we fade into dust?  No, we grow like the trees, sway in the breeze, and follow our natural flow.  The stone is no more impervious to oblivion than we or the trees--yet it is static.  Unshaken, yet whittled to dust like us.  The tree is equally unbothered by its fate, and yet it provides for all.  We humans ought to aspire to be the adaptable and flexible tree, rooted in virtue.  Everything dies.

One hears ""memento mori"" and finds mortality depressing.  Yet it is natural, not just for us but for everything.  It is not a call beckoning us to our ends, but a rally to live naturally and live well.  For despite death, we are now and will always be a part of existence.  Our body decays, but provides beyond death.  If we provide for life after death, why not do so before it?  Everything dies.

No, I will not fatalistically approach my death.  Yet, nor will I deny it.  For why fear or bemoan or deny death if one lives a life fully?  If you fear death, it is because you believe you have not lived as well as you could have.  So, live well in the time that remains; be that a day or a decade.  Everything dies.

This call to remember death is a call to remember virtue.  Do not fool yourself into immortality and viciousness, but embrace your impermanence by living well.  Everything dies.

Everything dies.",Stoicism,1612529017.0,t3_ld6dh1,0.99,732

Memento mori is a consolation to me,"Does anyone else find relief or comfort in the Idea of momento mori?


I find that remembering that I am going to die and that all my mistakes as well as achievements are going to be lost and forgotten to the world in a few years is hugely calming. It sort of takes the pressure off of my mind that my lifespan is not important and I am free to live in a way which I find virtuous without worrying about having to live it permanently.


The death of others is also comforting to me. Not that I find other's deaths good or that death makes me happy, it's just that it makes me happy to know we must all go through death, and everybody will receive respite from their lives regardless of how good or bad it is.


I think this might also come from the fact that I find immortality to be a terrifying idea. Anyone relate??

"Stoicism is not just about changing your expectations and your actions, it's also about changing where you place your happiness.","One of the most difficult Stoic practices in my experience has been the practice to shift where I place my happiness. I never really thought about ""where I place my happiness"", I just kind of always lived with some things making me happy and others not so much. 

Stoicism teaches us to place our happiness in our own virtue. This is obvious - virtue is the only thing you can control, so why the hell would you place your happiness anywhere outside of your own control. However, my Stoic practice often made me self-frustrated, tense, etc. Because even though I was acting virtuously, I forgot to place my happiness there. This is arguably one of the most important practices for any Stoic, as you will feel a direct correlation between your level of virtue and your level of happiness.

My first year of progress under Stoicism and Therapy,"This post is not for bragging, I still have a very long way to go. I am writing this to tell you that if I was able to do this, am pretty sure you can too.

I was in a rut for a long time, i mean years. I worked different jobs, had few relationships, had a social life, but i wasn't really doing well. I had a drug problem, health issues, i was very messy, and unproductive, and always bored. Today i am a very different man, I am productive, self-reliant, and finding new interests everyday.

The change started when i started seeing a therapist, to many of my friends, i was ok, i didn't need therapy, but  i started going to therapy to deal with my cigarette addiction. I can't tell you how much therapy helped me find a new perspective towards my actions, and how much time i actually waste. Therapy pointed me towards reading, and when i read about stoicism, it changed my life. I have never found a doctrine so close to what i naturally believed about the nature of life (Logos), our purpose and duty as humans, and what constitutes good and bad. But finding out about stoicism is not enough, i had to start changing my habits and lifestyle to be able to live what i believe. I started doing my bed everyday, and that is it. Regardless of how late i woke up, how lazy i felt, i had to force myself to do the bed everyday. After a month of only that, i started to add a little extra chore, then another, then another. I started reading daily, even if it is just one page, i started exercising/stretching everyday, even if it was just a minute worth of exercise. Starting 2021, i kept a journal, and started a to-do list for the next day. That curbed my drug use and helped me overcome my addiction towards cigarettes. Only after a 45 days of quitting cigarettes, i was running 10 Km every other day, and looking for half marathons to join. I have found a new musical instrument to learn, and most importantly, i can deal with my thoughts and anxiousness, i no longer need to run away from myself.

Just be ready to disappoint the terrible voices in your head telling you 'am too tired', 'how about we skip today', 'there is no reason to do this', or 'I am not good enough to be better'.

Never felt more in control of my life than now. All because of a simple stoic principle,"After many years of overthinking and overanalyzing, up to the point that it ruined things that were meaningful to me I understood that I needed a change. 

Before I started reading and learning stoicism I always had the absurd idea in my head that I could somehow change things that were not myself. Things of ”nature”, things out of my control. Stoicism helped me understand that I could only be in control of myself, other things, things of nature, will always find their own way, much like I found my way. 

I was always obsessed with control, but never truly felt content, no mather how much control I had. I have come to the understanding of why that was. It was because even though I sometimes felt the illusion of being in control of nature, I never really were in control of myself. For I let nature define and control me.

15 points that compress so much (for me),"I am sure none of this is earth-shattering, but it rocked me as a bunch of pieces all fell into place as I was showering one day.

What follows is the sudden product of a long journey of journalling, reading and thinking. It will not map as vividly to your own mindset and precepts as it did mine.

As such, I offer it here in hope it can be a useful schema in your own development. So, in 15 points:

1. You will tend to regret (or regret more) the things you did not do.

2. Therefore it always makes sense to do the right kind of things.

3. The right kind of things are the inklings, hopes and notions in your mind that are recurrent, stable and persistent yet rarely engrossing or distracting.

4. This is because these things come from the stable and long-term aspects of your character, not your moment-to-moment lusts or hungers.

5. When you undertake the right kind of action, the consequences - good or bad - will make sense because they will accord with your values. You may invite grief by acting thus, but the grief will be meaningful.

6. As you conduct yourself this way, the proportion of your life that is meaningful to you will increase in line with how much of it is the consequence of your previous values-based choices.

7. Given all this, it is imperative you find - or find signs of - your values as soon as possible.

8. And then begin acting on these as soon as possible afterwards.

9. Always with a mind to know them more precisely as you evolve and your values become clearer.

10. Because, like it or not, your life circumstances are the product of your previous choices.

11. Because, whether or not you're aware of it, the older you get, the more of your life is the product of your past choices.

12. It is thus wisdom and maturity to accept this and accept that you are responsible for all the of the reasonably foreseeable consequences of your actions.

13. Thus it makes sense to seek to live without regrets - both of action and omission.

14. Yet, as no one is all-knowing, senseless hazard will still visit upon your wise life.

15. But, if you have enough wisdom, any turbulence will be a minor and temporary, lost in the vast calm of that is the estate of a wise life.

These and the relationships between them are still under development on this end. Nevertheless, done is better than perfect, and I hope some of the above is useful in your pursuit of wisdom.",Stoicism,1609039074.0,t3_kkw3b7,0.98,717

I have been using this lesser-known stoic exercise from Seneca for the past 2 months. It has drastically changed my life. I feel happier and have a greater sense of purpose. It's my duty to share it with you.,"I was reading the ‘Moral Letters to Luculias’ by the Stoic philosopher Seneca.

Letter 12 *‘On Old Age’* had some interesting ideas which relate to our motto of ***Live and Die Well***.

The letter starts off with Seneca explaining a situation he had with a builder.

Repairs needed to be made to one of Seneca’s homes.

Unforeseen problems kept popping up (I guess contractors were the same even 2,000 years ago).

Seneca suspected the builder was trying to finesse him for more money.

He probed to see what the issue was, but the builder insisted he was doing everything in his power.

The builder explained the issue came from the material of the house being ‘old’.

Seneca realized the builder was right and was confronted with this thought:

*“What has the future in store for me, if stones of my own age are already crumbling?”*

This led him to contemplate his mortality as was typical of Stoics.

# Nature Wins

The ageing process is illusive.

The days go by so slowly, and we don’t notice ourselves getting older.

But as we age, more proof begins to appear.

When it comes, the realizations are shocking.

I remember when I was younger and would move tremendous weights in the gym with no issue.

Today, entering my 30s, I already notice a difference in the amount of punishment my body can take.

What would take me 2 days to recover from now takes 3 to 4 days.

At age 17, I had no injuries and my body felt like it was made out of rubber.

It was malleable and could easily bounce back from snap-city.

Today, I have to avoid certain exercises which trigger those injuries.

At age 15, I could eat junk food every day and not put on any weight.

Now, if I have a bender and cheat on my diet over the weekend, that scale will be setting new personal records.

I remember being 10 years old and poking fun at a family member

She got upset because I called her Morgan Freeman.

I called her that because she has those small dots on her skin Morgan Freeman has.

They are called Dermatosis Papulosa Nigra and are common in black people.

The other day whilst looking in the mirror I saw a few of those dots.

*“They weren’t there before!”*

I had to laugh at the irony of it all.

These things are small and trivial

But are evidence of a decaying body.

Reminders of mortality.

Proof that our meat suits have an expiry date.

Yes, I am young and strong.

But one day, I will be weak and withered.

Instead of running away from this natural process, Seneca invites us to embrace it.

He explains how things often get better right before the decline.

Fruit reaches its peak flavour before getting too ripe and falling off the tree.

Wine tastes better with age before going bad and spoiling.

Ageing allows you to let go of the emotional and psychological baggage which weighed you down during your youth.

Ageing done right is a stripping away process.

Allowing you to move away from the physical to the spiritual.

# Requiem for a King

Seneca explains how Pacuvius, a Roman elite, would conduct his own memorial service.

The service would have wine and feasting.

The halls will be filled with people celebrating his life.

It would climax with Pacuvius being carried from the dinner table to his bed whilst people chanted,

*“He has lived, he has lived!”*

Pacuvius would wake up the next day and continue business as usual.

Seneca instructs us to follow his example but for noble reasons, not narcissism.

*“Every day ought to be regulated as if it closed the series, as if it rounded out and completed our existence…let us go to our sleep with joy and gladness;* ***let us say: I have lived;*** ***the course which Fortune set for me Is finished***\*. And if God is pleased to add another day, we should welcome it with glad hearts.”\*

— Seneca

When you wake up, assume that day is all you have.

Don’t waste time stressing about the future or worrying about the past.

Do what you need to do in the present.

This allows you to focus on what matters and not waste time on petty affairs.

It allows you to be grateful.

It gives you clarity.

Steve Jobs carried out a similar exercise.

*“For the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: ‘If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?’ And whenever the answer has been no for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.”*

— Steve Jobs

This exercise will provide you with immense clarity.

Farewell,

Isaac

The power of the shrug. 🤷‍♀️,"Our brain reacts to our body, and how we act can influence how we think. Think of your body posture, for example: Standing up straight, keeping your chin up and walking tall can actually make you feel more confident, proud, and powerful. Using a stress ball can relieve tension and reduce blood pressure. Taking deep breaths can calm us down and help clear our minds. I thought I'd share something I do to help me stay Stoic when the defecation hits the oscillation.

I shrug. A lot. This is something my friends have pointed out to me over the years, but I've never stopped doing it. ^(I also use the shrug emoji a lot too.) Something about the physical action, which as a human I have naturally associated with indifference, helps me actually achieve a higher degree of indifference. Obviously, and I want to emphasize this, Stoicism is not about 100% indifference all of the time. But in times where it is very beneficial to remain calm, cool, and collected, beginning my thought process with the physical act of shrugging does wonders to keep me centered.

Stoicism defused a potentially violent confrontation,"I wanted to share an anecdote that happened to me recently. A few days ago I was taking a train downtown and saw a man waiting on the platform. By his body language I could already tell he was full of anger and frustration. He was holding a slice of pizza and a can of Pepsi, and maliciously ripping toppings off the pizza and throwing them on the floor. 

As we got on to the train, it was immediately apparent that he was going to cause trouble. Within seconds, he was yelling at strangers, staring them down, getting in their face and insulting them, trying to scare and intimate old ladies and throwing pizza all over the place, and just generally causing a disturbance to other passengers. He then shook his can of Pepsi and sprayed it all over the train. Many people moved but I just stood there and quietly listened to my music. I took out my phone to change a song, to which he immediately saw me and responded with, ""are you filming me with your fucking phone?"" even though it had been pointed nowhere near him, nor had I any interest in having videos of this man on my phone. He then targeted me to focus his anger and frustration, which I was honestly grateful for as it drew his attention away from innocent passengers. He got within inches of my face, threatening to hit me verbally as well as taking swings at the air around me. He shouted in my face again about filming him even though I didn't even have my phone out anymore. He continued trying to provoke me, saying things like ""hit me you fucking pussy, I dare you"", and a variety of other things to try to get me to fuel his self-destructive tendencies. He then spilled some of his Pepsi on me, and spat on my arm (it should come as no surprise to any of you that he was not wearing a mask). This carried on for several minutes without stopping. 

Throughout this entire ordeal, I just calmly stared directly into his eyes and didn't look away for a second. I could sense the lifetime of pain and mistreatment this man endured, and his inability to cope with it. His anger and frustration, his thoughts that causing fear and intimidation to others was the only way in which he could get any power or respect in this world. I could see genuine stress from the frabricated thought that I was filming him, and his emotional reaction to that fiction. I simply continued to stare at him, unflinching, not reacting emotionally, not saying a word, not choosing to fight but also not choosing to back down. The act of doing nothing took all of his power away. I could see the discomfort and insecurity stemming from another man looking into his eyes for an extended period of time. The acts themselves, of silence and eye contact, are nothing. But I could see the fear in his eyes at the realization that no matter what he did or said to me, he was not in control of my actions or emotions.  Without realizing, the train had already reached the next stop. Part of me wanted to ask the man if he needed help, but I knew his ego would not allow him to accept it and it would likely make the situation worse. So I pointed to the door, and simply said, ""Go."" He immediately gathered his things and walked straight out the door without saying another word to me or the other passengers. 

While I do not wish to pity people like this, I genuinely hope that he was able to learn something from this situation, that there is another way to approach life other than fear, intimidation, and emotional outbursts. As I learned so much from this situation about the intentions of a man, the reactions behind emotions, how flimsy is a house built on a foundation of foolishness and arrogance, and how much one's mind can fabricate, react, and emote from literal nothing.  

As I reflect, I recall a quote that helped me keep my cool and stay true to my convictions.

Being Stoic does not mean being a doormat,"Stoicism is often depicted in various forms of media and literature as being ""emotionless"". I feel that it is important to clarify, being stoic does not mean being a doormat. It does not mean to suppress your emotions, your persona, and your livelihood. That is a one way ticket to bitterness and frustration. It does not mean to see how much suffering you can endure, you will only be the king of your own mental prison. Stoicism means that regardless of whatever your circumstances, obstructions, and emotions are, you remain unfazed and respond accordingly in a manner such that is not influenced by your external or internal circumstances. You can most certainly be stoic and acknowledge ""negative"" emotions and undesirable circumstances. It just means that your actions are not influenced by them, it does not warrant lack of action. Do not confuse stoicism for suppression of emotion, that will guarantee depression. Stoicism is a celebration of your character, and to honour your virtue, and continue to develop your character. Do not confuse stoicism with being harmless or docile, while it is great to avoid all unnecessary conflict, that is not reality. Do not be afraid of confrontation and challenge, again, no matter the circumstance, even if the world is burning, your response and character is to remain unfazed and you respond accordingly. Being stoic means to be a warrior, in whichever way you believe is true to you and to confront all challenges and obstructions in your life such that, your response and goal is unaffected by your external or internal factors. Stoicism is the highest form of self-expression, not self-repression.",Stoicism,1614621793.0,t3_lvftnu,0.98,712
Accepting Pain,"Yesterday I had the chance to practice this. One of my clients is an international 5 star hotel. The IT manager asked if I could attend urgently and I did. Problem took a bit longer than expected into Friday night but we fixed it.

The IT manager was so grateful that he wanted to offer me lunch, then paused and asked me if I was in a relationship. He wanted to offer me a free room. When I said no ( I have been single for 7 years), he looked disappointed and asked me why as I was a nice guy.

Onto the stoicism part. I'll admit: I felt pain (I really want a relationship and to have children.). But as usual, I ran away from it. So there I was, driving home, and feeling pained. Then it struck me: Why am I resisting pain? Maybe I should invite pain. Maybe I should allow it. So I decided that yes, I felt pain and that it is welcome to be felt by my emotional self. After all it was true and part of myself, no need to deny it.

The moment I accepted it, I calmed down. Its like I ""forgot about it"". I accepted it, moved on, and was and still am at peace with it.

Its not a ground breaking post, but I am grateful that I am making small steps into improving my life with Stoicism.",Stoicism,1619253965.0,t3_mxfzt4,0.99,710

"When times are hard remember this: ""The virtue of self-discipline itself might become a greater source of pleasure than the external objects of our desire"".","From 'How to think like a roman emperor'

So when Life isn't going too well but you're still getting up in the morning, trying to stay positive. This in itself is quite gratifying (not the actual action of being positive but the act of you not giving in to the situation. The action of being positive in a crap situation feels like anything but!). Currently going through a break-up and keep reminding myself of her but I instantly refocus my mind because these thoughts aren't helpful, this feels gratifying which further strengthens my mind when I think of our relationship.

I've been reading this book again and I think we too easily see being positive as something we should just do, but we can work it to our favor by seeing that when we refrain from doing something which perhaps is not in our best interests, the refraining may not feel nice as we're missing out but the action of missing out by choice is a powerful move which in itself should feel gratifying.

So shitty situations are shitty but we can always gain something from it and don't have to feel helpless. I'm assuming the same can be said for amazing situations (new job, car, lottery win) restraint in this situation would also feel gratifying.

This is something I'm still working on, especially when Life is going well. This is possibly harder than when Life isn't going well.

"I lost someone very special to me. In return, I found myself.","After going through intense heartbreak and losing someone dear to my heart, I'd nowhere to turn. I considered therapy, but my very niche health insurance doesn't cover it.

So, I turned to stoicism. I'd considered the idea and practice before, but never too seriously.

Now it's time to get serious.

My entire life I would let my thoughts and emotions control me, and anyone who tried to help would say ""it's all in your head,"" or ""change your attitude.""

I thought they were all saying the same unhelpful thing on repeat, so I ignored it.

Turns out, they were right.

No, it didn't change anything immediately, but accepting it in my mind was the most helpful and important step on becoming the best version of myself.

How do I accept the fact that I will never be loved romantically?,"I have been very unattractive to women since I was 14 and puberty made it worse. I'm 20 and there isn't any hope for me in the future for sure, in terms of looks. Like any young man, I have strong sexual needs as well and also, I want to settle down one day with someone to start a family but I just don't see that happening. I look in the mirror and feel disgusted sometimes, and I say to myself ""why would anyone even romantically love me?"". I just want to live this life happily without seeking love. I just can't seem to do that. What bothers is that when I go out or on anywhere else, I have this sense of jealousy when I see a young couple in love with each other. It doesn't make me angry, just very sad. I makes me think ""man I wish I was attractive"". 

&#x200B;

Now the Stoic approach to this is very simple, I can't control the perception of attractiveness in someone else's mind. I can only change what's in my control. The only thing I want to do in this life is that I somehow stop the pursuit of finding love in a person. I just want to accept solitude forever but I can't seem to do that. Maybe I'm biologically programmed this way but still I want to get rid of this. I want to go out and do stuff I like without having an urge of wanting to be with someone romantically. I just want to get rid of this.

Edit: Thank you so much for all your comments. I have decided to work more on myself. I have realised I’m not even that bad looking and I’ve been too hard on myself, it was just my low self-esteem.

Envy is a stupid feeling that only exists to make us feel bad,"Let's say you win a million dollars. You're really happy and you buy a new house, a new car and you're having a great time.

However, you find out everyone else in the world won 10 million dollars and is also very happy. They start buying bigger houses and more cars than you.

Suddently you're feeling bad because you think you're the worst person on the planet. That your life is mediocre when compared to everyone else.

However, YOU WON A MILLION DOLLARS! You were having a great time before you found out you weren't the best. Just because the others are now richer than you that doesn't mean you aren't! You have a great house! You don't have any financial problems! You have a great car!

We need to stop judging our happiness in comparison to the others but by if we're happy or not.

"I often wake up with a sense of fear and anxiety.

Life will end one day. How does anything matter anyway? If I do good, ppl might or might not remember. If I do bad, ppl might or might not remember. But for the most part, everything that I do goes unnoticed.

So why should I care about being virtuous. Why should I care about anything.

I still don't know what makes me happy. I'm trying to derive happiness by being virtuous. I don't know if that's wrong way to look at it. I tried to find happiness in pleasure before. Well it feels good in the beginning for a little while. After that, it's just a routine or addiction or simply an urge to do. There's no real long-term sustainable happiness in pleasure.
