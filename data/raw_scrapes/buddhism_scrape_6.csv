"Schizophrenia, Understanding Delusion, and Buddhist Philosophy","I've thought about bringing this subject up many times, but have failed to find a cogent way to present it. I'm in no better position to do so now, however, I feel that I may as well introduce my thoughts on the subject more generally, perhaps as a sort of testimony that some may find interesting.

I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia at the age of thirteen after a period of two years of being symptomatic. In hindsight, I had suffered from symptoms since I was a young child. I remember lucid dreaming and sleepwalking quite explicitly as a child; this is usually attributed to the heightened senses that come with paranoia (the persistent state of being on guard) interfering with the brain/body's ability to shutdown quickly or fully. I didn't have the knowledge to be able to interpret my experiences in any way other than a growing child. It was part of my perception of the nature of things and people that was being developed through experience. As I grew, I became aware that my experiences were unusual and inconsistent when analyzed with a growing knowledge base and when I tried in vain to utilize my experiences as one would other perceptual experiences.

Due in large part to being medically cared for at a young age, I was in a persistent state of reckoning. I had to reckon my direct experiences (it is often challenging to separate hallucinations and illusions from objective phenomena) with the knowledge that I was unreliable and hindered in my ability to distinguish these things in real time. Over time, this became something of a skill which was beneficial to me in critical studies such as literature, rhetoric, and history classes. It was rather a damning thing for me in my social development as I was constantly suspicious of others. I applied analytic methods to their actions, words, and even at times their very existence. It was quite distressful, and increasingly the only way in which I could cope with the stress was to keep up the habit. I had perhaps become too disillusioned with taking things as they presented themselves. It was a disposition that I found necessary to protecting myself.

I was first exposed to Buddhism from an interest in Japanese studies. My high school offered Japanese language as my city has been a fairly prominent diaspora and academic community with ties to Japan. I didn't learn too deeply as at this time, information wasn't as available or cheap as it is today (generally and in my circumstances). Most of what I consumed on the subject was either survey knowledge or guides on meditation. I was secular in my interests at the time, and became involved in regular meditation when I was sixteen guided by techniques that I later learned as a combination of scientific, Buddhist-oriented, and Hindu-oriented methods. Since then, I have practiced meditation frequently but not according to any schedule. When I began going to college, I studied literature, but finding that my interests were particularly in religious literature (both sacred texts and fiction in which religion and religious philosophy played a role), I quickly moved to a larger university where I was able to study religion as a major program.

From the beginning of this formal education, my interests were thematic or conceptual. I learned about religious traditions chiefly so as to have information to synthesize with thematic studies. With guidance from the department, I became quite prominent in linguistic, ethnographic, and ritual studies with an inclination towards utilizing Marx/Bell and Geertz as my models for interpreting religious concepts and behaviors. The deeper my studies grew, the more I became interested in applying Buddhist lenses to my personal experiences. I found it easier than many to accept the epistemological notions of the world internal and external as dependent concepts enforced by ignorance and perceptual challenges. 

I have felt very fortunate to be able to apply the constructed practice of suspicion to phenomena inside me and in my environment. I'm glad to say that it has less often lead to dark places wherein I have felt helpless or doomed and more often to situations wherein I have felt empowered to be critical of accepting things as they present themselves. I have become comfortable with examining my motives and the motives of others in a way that has lead to my being able to curtail problems and promote healthy relationships. I sometimes see others, especially those who are stressed or defeated, as suffering in a similar way to the way in which I suffered when I was under the delusion of being helpless. However, it is difficult for me to help others come around to the same conclusions in that it was not something that simply clicked, but a lengthy process that I am still undertaking. I am better able to control my angers and sadnesses and convert my reactions into a compassionate helping hand.

I don't know that I am breaking new ground here or if this is a common, boring, or wonderful testimony, but I hope it does some good to those who may be suffering from mental illness or know someone who is better understand some of the ways in which it almost creates a predisposition towards realization and compassionate output. Feel free to ask anything you wish that I may be able to comment upon and I'll do my best.",Buddhism,1383103842.0,t3_1piku6,0.97,1293

I was sexually assaulted by a head monk earlier this year. Just want to get it off my chest.,"Back in January I went through a tough breakup. I was suffering from it quite a lot and didn‚Äôt know who to turn to for solace. I had the idea to visit my nearest temple, who ran group meditation sessions each evening. 

I joined in for one of the sessions where it was just me, one other person and the head monk. When I arrived, the monk asked me how I was going and I didn‚Äôt know how to respond other than to cry. He was extremely compassionate and told me he‚Äôd like me to stay after the meditation to talk - as he said he could help me. 

After the meditation, we went for a long walk in nature and I got the opportunity to ask him tons of questions. I was amazed at how much he seemed to care. He then gave me a whole bunch of delicious vegetarian food he had left over. He told me to come back to the temple the following day at noon, as he wanted me to join him on a bush-walk where he would also show me some chants/mantras. So I came back.

I was expecting there to be a group of people, but it was just him. And I thought he had a specific place in mind, but he got into my car and asked me if I knew of a place where there was no-one around. I said no, and he suggested we kept driving until we found a remote place. I was very confused and started seeing red-flags,  but was too non-confrontational to say anything - especially after he had been so kind to me. We end up driving down very remote dirt roads in the bush, and then get out and walk deep into the bush where there is no other human for miles away. 

I won‚Äôt go into detail about the sexual aspect of what he did, but he started off by putting a blanket on the ground (that he asked me to bring) and told me he‚Äôd give me a massage. I was very uncomfortable at this point and allowed him to rub my shoulders. He then made his way down to inappropriate areas and I told him to stop. He tried again and told me that it‚Äôs okay if I fall asleep from the massage. 

I pretended like I got bitten by a spider and jumped up and said I need to go. The ride back to the temple (to drop him off) was very awkward, and he told me that the ‚Äúnew healing technique‚Äù he tried on me was something he hadn‚Äôt done before and was just practicing, and that I shouldn‚Äôt tell anyone about it. I pretended to be very naive and left after dropping him off.

What upset me the most was how disappointed I felt in humanity afterwards. It made me question how I can trust anybody if I can‚Äôt even trust a head monk. Was very disappointing at a time I was already so vulnerable.

Just wanted to get this off my chest. I‚Äôm also aware that this is not representative of most monks or of Buddhism. And I‚Äôm sure Buddha himself would definitely not have approved, lol.

Edit: I‚Äôm also a male. Which is why it was even more unexpected and able to go so far before realising something was wrong.

Edit #2: thanks for all the encouragement. I think I will contact the temple and report it to someone there. I‚Äôve since moved countries (it happened in Australia, and I moved to the US) - so making a report to the authorities will be difficult. But I can try and get in touch with someone else at the temple and let them know what transpired.",Buddhism,1639942407.0,t3_rk3vds,0.97,1021

A Reminder From The Buddha,"' The Buddha recommends that we recite the ‚ÄúFive Remembrances‚Äù every day: 

(1) I am of the nature to grow old. There is no way to escape growing old. 

(2) I am of the nature to have ill-health. There is no way to escape having ill-health. 

(3) I am of the nature to die. There is no way to escape death. 

(4) All that is dear to me and everyone I love are of the nature to change. There is no way to escape being separated from them. 

(5) My actions are my only true belongings. I cannot escape the consequences of my actions. My actions are the ground on which I stand. '

The premise of Buddhism in simple English:,"A friend of mine once asked about what Buddhism was all about. I wrote this up for him. Hope you get a few laughs.

There was this guy named Buddha. He realized that people can be really selfish and sometimes really stupid. They get upset because their lives are really sucky and all they did was blame other people for their problems. He felt bad and tried to figure it out. Aside from the inevitables like, birth, growth, illness, and death, he figured out there was a way to not be so affected by the situations that life presented. He presented four absolute (noble) truths and 8 ways to realize them.

**4 noble truths:**

1. life can suck.

2. it sucks because we get attached to the stuff that we imagine makes
     our selves ""unique"" and ""special.""

3. There is a way to not be affected by the suckness.

4. If we open our eyes and follow eight simple methods,
      we can be freed from letting the suckness affect us.

**8 fold path:**

1. No one is absolute nor omnipotent. We're all pretty ignorant.


2. If you don't learn to stop and say, ""hey, i don't know"" you're not going to change yourself
      in a way that's going to free you from the suckness.


3. Don't open your mouth without considering wtf it's going to
     sound like to the person on the receiving end.


4. You're not the center of the universe. Your actions not only affect everything around
     you, they can affect everything around the people around you.
     Don't do stupid shit that's going to hurt other people or yourself.


5. Don't take action that's going to make life suck for other people at your benefit.


6. If something pisses you off, figure out if you need to fix yourself first. Otherwise,


7. Know the consequences of your actions, you dumb fuck.
     Moreover, everyone has their own reality and their own right to their own level of dumbfuckery.
     When you make a mistake (you will), don't be proud, admit it, and be open to remedy yourself
     and the situation. And when in a group take care to not act unless it benefits the group in someway.


8. If you don't pay attention to the task at hand you're going to have a bad time.
    (Stop texting and pay attention to the wheel, you dumb fuck)

I am shattered,"I live in India and pandemic has become a monster here. Everyday, I am seeing people dying on roads and at hospital doors because of lack of oxygen supplies. 24/7 pyres are burning. 

I am unable to take it anymore. Unable to take anymore the helpless cries of people. 

I need positive vibes or I might just collapse. 

I don't know how this sub can help but just felt like posting here. 

People are in shock and I dread will I be next.

Help.

Edit- Thank you all..I feel loved and it feels good to see such kind,helpful and insightful messages from all of you. 

I have been meditating but somehow these days I am unable to focus but I continue anyways.

This morning,I came to know that one of my neighbors, with whom we have family like connections, died due to covid. I use to meet him everyday before covid.  While writing this, I feel unable to contain my grief. But,I promise to stay composed. 

I wish to go to place where for few moments I could escape this. But that would not help.

Maybe after covid, I would spend few days with nature to heal myself.

Anger is another emotion that I am feeling a lot because my govt inspite of being told that second wave will be dangerous didn't plan. Newspapers are reporting that people would have survived if only they were sick with covid but they are dying in large numbers due to extreme scarcity of oxygen supplies for which the reason is mismanagement. 

I feel good writing to you because it helps me express my feelings. I feel heard . 

Love to all.

( I have pasted the same in comment section )

Edit- thank you for giving hugz/ silver awards. Your concern and love gives me peace. 

Today Delhi High court rebuked the govt of completely failing to manage. The judge said that the govt could bury their head but they cannot. Such things are happening but situation for common men is still worse. 

I am hearing the stories of kids losing both of their parents and my heart breaks to feel what they might be going through. I want to help all of them. I know what it feels to lose a parent for I lost my dad in 2018 but for these kids the pain and hopelessness is immense.

I wish I had financial resources to help all. 

Friends, now I know why I shared this with you. Because based on the beautiful wisdom that you shared with me, I don't want to escape this sadness but I am hoping to transform into something positive.

To be honest, at this moment, I don't know what's in store. 

It's hell here. The people who are left behind are unable to forget what their loved ones have gone through in their last moments. More than covid, it's scarcity of oxygen that's killing people. I am not exaggerating..just read about it and you will know. 

My mom is my priority. Taking all the care to keep my mom and sis safe. But, to see other families collapsing is giving me nightmares. 

I am not watching news but everyday I am getting to know from my neighborhood and friends.

Almost everyone is saying they have never been this frightened. 

Doctors are crying on camera because they can't stand losing patients to lack of oxygen.

Anyways, I am full of gratitude to all of you. Reading your messages make me hopeful. 

People have suggested to chant which I will do inspite of my faith becoming shaky.

Love to you all.

Give my regards to your family. 
Love to all of them.",Buddhism,1620078425.0,t3_n48baa,0.98,840

"The best part about Buddhism is that even if it's all bullshit, it's still a beautiful concept.","I've been learning about karma. The other day my roommate did something hateful. My feelings were hurt and I was scheming ways to get back at him. Then I remembered what I had learned. I realized that the universe would take care of it, and that if I retaliated I would just be damaging my own karma. And I let it go. And for the first time in a long time, I felt peace.
The best part is that I'm a hardcore skeptic. I doubt everything. I have faith in nothing. I'm a nihilist to the core. The thing about Buddhism, though, is that even if none of this means anything, the system still worked. I still felt peace. Regardless of whether or not my roommate suffers for his actions, I removed it from my thoughts.

Anger is Within Me: Thich Nhat Hanh,"""A monk decides to meditate alone.
Away from his monastery, he takes a boat and goes to the middle of the lake, closes his eyes and begins to meditate.

After a few hours of unperturbed silence,
he suddenly feels the blow of another boat hitting his. With his eyes still closed, he feels his anger rising and, when he opens his eyes, he is ready to shout at the boatman who dared to disturb his meditation. But when he opened his eyes,
saw that it was an empty boat, not tied up, floating in the middle of the lake...

At that moment, the monk achieves self-realization and understands that anger is within him; it simply needs to hit an external object to provoke it.

After that, whenever he meets someone who irritates or provokes his anger, he remembers; the other person is just an empty boat.

Anger is inside me.""",Buddhism,1629130680.0,t3_p5jd2v,0.99,825

I quit fishing today.,"I just wanted to share an experience I had today with you guys. I've been practicing Buddhism on and off for a few years now and while I've adopted a lot of practices into my everyday life, I never seemed to be able to give up my hobby of fishing. 

Today I was out fishing with my dad like usual and I managed to hook a turtle. When I saw the turtle come out of the water, I immediately felt remorse because ""that's not supposed to happen"" when you're fishing. Then it hit me. I didn't feel that same degree of remorse when we pulled a catfish out of the water earlier because ""that's what happens when you fish"". The bait and setup was the exact same for the two animals that came from the water, and both were hooked and removed from their homes by my actions. But it wasn't ""okay"" for one of them to be treated as such. I realized that I was choosing what degree of suffering is ""acceptable"" to inflict on the aquatic ecosystem, and came to the conclusion that I don't want to cause ANY harm there and that by justifying poor treatment of one species, I was being a hypocrite. So I quit fishing today.

The Afternoon I Became a Buddhist Without Realizing It,"A few years ago I was in a lot of mental anguish. I escaped a very rough domestic situation and I was living on my own in a tough section of town (think junkies laying around, high crime, etc). A small Buddhist temple waited two blocks away from me and I would see it when I walked or drove past. I wasn't curious, because I was very anti-religion and angry at all forms of spirituality due to my upbringing. 

 I was raised in an Abrahamic faith and I was taught that Buddhists and Hindus are stupid animal-, idol- and rock-worshippers pagans who will suffer in the afterlife for their blasphemy. I didn't really believe this, but I had no positive thoughts about Buddhists to counter it. 

One day when I was feeling just awful, I decided I'd see these stupid idol-worshippers for myself. Why not? I didn't believe in my own faith anymore, and the temple looked peaceful. I'd just see what dumb shit those Buddhists were muttering about and be on my way. Then I could dismiss all religion as garbage and suffer in peace.

I entered the temple before a meditation class and wandered around. Everything was very clean, neat, and organized. The two monks seemed calm. I felt indifferent, but supposed that I should show respect for their welcome, so I approached the monks and asked if they had any chores they needed help with or if there was anything I could fetch for them. 

One monk said, ""Could you please sort the letters for the sign out front? Please put them in alphabetical order."" and I agreed. I sat down with the box of disorganized letters and began to sift through them. It was a big box, and the task was very dull, so my mind wandered. 

I thought about how much I hated religion and how much I hated God. I thought about how worthless I was, and how I just seemed to cause suffering wherever I went. I thought about how my parents hurt me, my spouse abused me, and the teachers at school ignored me. I suffered as I sorted the letters, but finally I finished and brought the box back to the monk. 

""Oh, you sorted them already!"" he said in delight and clapped his hands. 

""Yes, I'm sorry it took me so long. I probably messed it up anyways,"" I replied in a fit of self-hatred. ""You should check my work. It's no doubt all wrong.""

The monk gave me a very puzzled look, then took the box and checked the letters. 

""These are all in the correct order,"" he said with a smile. ""Did you know the Buddha himself couldn't have done a better job?""

I was stunned. I blinked and didn't know how to reply. I stammered out a thanks for his compliment and stayed for the meditation, but I couldn't think of anything but what the monk said. 

Even the Buddha couldn't have done a better job. 

In the faith I was raised within, it was blasphemy to compare oneself to divine figures in any way, shape, or form. It was hammered into my head that as a human I am stupid, weak, inferior, sinful, and unworthy of love. In my entire life, I had *never* been told I was equal to someone as worthy as the Buddha, *ever*. 

I couldn't stop thinking about it. What the monk said wouldn't leave me. He was right: even the Buddha couldn't put letters into order better than me. In even the smallest, most insignificant of ways, I was *as worthy as the Buddha*. 

I didn't know it, but that was the moment my shell cracked and I became a Buddhist. I learned more about Buddhism in the years that follow, and now I meditate every day and have taken refuge in the Three Jewels, but my transformation came that summer evening from the gentle joke of a monk. 

I tell this story to ease the minds of people who are suffering and who think they are unworthy. There are *many* aspects in which you, dear reader, *are exactly as worthy as the Buddha*. You are not stupid, sinful, and corrupt. You are precious, you are noble, and you can have freedom. 

Whenever you do a simple task, please remember your worth! You have much to learn from the Lord Buddha, but you are just as worthy as him! Don't give into self-hatred! Think about my afternoon sorting letters, and give yourself a shake: you *are* worthy, and your true nature is one of nobility.

I've started noticing images where Jesus and Buddhism or Buddha are combined. How do you feel about this and do you approve of this fusion?

There were periods of depression and sadness and self medicating, but I always seemed to come back.

A Message of Compassion During Our Election,"There is a lot of tension in the political scene of the US right now. And it‚Äôs easy to get caught up in what is going on, what people are saying online, and ultimately what could happen. It‚Äôs meaningless to suffer over something that is outside our direct control whether that be political events or the provocative words and ideas of another.

Do not label those who disagree with you as anything less than human and revoke them of their right of your compassion and understanding. Every person is a complex mixture of good, bad, and neutral. Just as we are ALL capable of compassion, understanding, and self discipline, dually we are ALL at risk of hatred, ignorance, and complacency. It is important to see the undesirable and ugly aspects of other people as also in ourselves, this in itself is an act of boundless love for self and All.


EDIT: Hey y‚Äôall, I just wanted to address a couple of things that have been mentioned in the comments down below.

Firstly, this is not a political post, nor should anyone use this as a place to push an agenda or even make their politics known. This isn‚Äôt about who‚Äôs right and who‚Äôs wrong and who‚Äôs to blame. This also isn‚Äôt about tolerance or inaction. To be tolerant and inactive in the face of what we perceive as wrong is wrong thought, wrong action, and wrong diligence. That being said, this post is for you the individual, and how you can deal with all that is happening in a wholesome way!

If you forget how to be compassionate towards someone, you run risk of losing your humanity. If you think that we can‚Äôt afford to be compassionate when trying to implement change and justice, or that it‚Äôs a privileged stance, I urge you to think on the holy examples of Dr. King, Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama, Gandhi, Thich Quang Duc, and so many others. 

Act not because you are fed up and angry, but because you are loving and understanding. To me, this is what it means to follow the teachings of the Buddha.",Buddhism,1604361517.0,t3_jmzh0m,0.98,618

Buddhism transformed me,"I lived my entire life up a few years ago as a hardcore atheist scientist who mocked religion as just being about fairy-tales to build churches until I one day actually bothered my ass to study what Buddhism was all about.

As I was studying it I came across a quote. The name of the person unfortunately escapes me. The quote was ""Believe in the Buddha or don't believe in the Buddha. Do the practice and see the results for yourself."" which struck a chord with me because it was a scientific statement.

So I studied further and tried to align my life as much as possible to the Noble Eightfold Path. One of my favorite things about Buddhism is the Three Marks of Existence, the Three Poisons and the Four Immeasurables. These descriptions are truly wise and I was a fool for not practicing being mindful of these as much as possible during my daily experiences in order to grow wiser.

I did what a good scientist and mathematician would do. I took these most basic constructs as axioms and theorems and then repeated the acts. I held them up like a lens to my experience in the world and I saw how these wisdoms applied transcendentally to all phenomena and wholesome human efforts.

Years down the line now I am ten times better off and I feel so much more peaceful and useful to other people now that I have shed my skin and made the correct choices and cast away the ignorance of relying too much on modern knowledge of science and popular psychology which eclipsed any real possibility for wisdom to arise.

It strikes me as really odd (and admittedly a little bit frustrating) that all my other colleagues in science don't find Buddhism interesting because it truly is marvelous to put it into practice and it made me grow up very quickly. In fact, I almost actually went totally crazy for real when I just started meditating and being mindful and I believe that it was my mind shaking off the sheer weight of misunderstanding. That is how powerful this practice is.

I adore being able to actually be skillful and help people. It is truly a higher calling and it is the one thing I do that brings me the greatest satisfaction out of anything else. Buddhism gave me the right tools to do this and I am very grateful and always amazed at how these beautiful teachings have shown me the correct way along a higher path.",Buddhism,1615297999.0,t3_m16tr6,0.99,606

I was grateful only to have been part of something like that, be it for a couple of hours (more, infinitely damn more will come). A feeling of freedom and support by the closest thing to a saint that one can find: the Buddhist nuns and monks. 


People, if you haven't done it already, full speed ahead and visit a temple or a monastery near you. Do yourself the biggest favour ever. Don't postpone. Just go.

The Tibetan community in exile now has an elected government, and I want them to carry out all the governmental and administrative responsibilities.

Basics of Buddhism,"Occasionally I get asked to summarize Buddhism or provide a list of introductory books or concepts for it. Here is what I have recently written up. 

Basics of Buddhism

The Buddha was a man named Siddharta Gautama who was born in Nepal in 623 BC and grew up in neighboring India. His life experiences led him at the age of 35 to sit under a tree for 49 days. He had realizations there which he then spent the rest of his life teaching to others, primarily for the purpose of helping people to relieve their psychological suffering. He died at the age of 80 and was even teaching others to find happiness on their own with his last words: ""Be islands unto yourselves, refuges unto yourselves, seeking no external refuge...Everything is temporary. Strive with earnestness!""

Introductory Buddhist Book Suggestions:

* The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching, by Thich Nhat Hanh
* When Things Fall Apart, by Pema Chodron
* What the Buddha Taught, by Walpola Rahula
* In the Buddha's Words, by Bhikkhu Bodhi
* Everyday Zen, by Charlotte Joko Beck
* Dhammapada, by The Buddha

You can't go wrong just reading original words of the Buddha as documented in the suttas. My favorite website for that is:

[https://www.accesstoinsight.org/](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/)

All that said... here are the basics of Buddhism:

Short Summary:

* ""Do good. Refrain from evil. Purify your mind. This is the teaching of all the enlightened ones."" - The Buddha, Dhammapada

Another short summary:

* Morality + Mindfulness = Wisdom & Happiness - In other words, if you practice being moral and mindful you will become wise and happy(er).

Four Noble Truths:

1. Suffering (unhappiness, dissatisfaction) exists.
2. The cause of suffering is craving.
3. There is a cure which can end your personal suffering.
4. That cure is described in the eightfold path of practice.

Eightfold Path of Practice:

Morality

* Wise Action
* Wise Speech
* Wise Livelihood

Mindfulness

* Wise Effort
* Wise Mindfulness
* Wise Concentration

Wisdom

* Wise Understanding
* Wise Intention

Daily meditation is often practiced by Buddhists. The Buddha described 3 main types of meditation in his talks:

* Tranquility Meditation - Anapanasati Sutta: https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.118.than.html
* Insight Meditation - Satipatthana Sutta: https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.010.than.html
* Loving Kindness Meditation - Karaniya Metta Sutta: https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/snp/snp.1.08.amar.html",Buddhism,1592502668.0,t3_hbji6d,0.99,591

Sixteen Years Of An Experiment Completed.,"Sixteen years ago yesterday I decided to do an experiment.

I bought a 8 x 5 college ruled memo pad and put it on a shelf in my living room with a Bic ballpoint pen.

Every time I meditated I put down the date, day, and duration of the sitting.

I kept up a continuous string of days because I did not want ""today"" to be the day that I broke that chain and missed meditating.

I'm still using those 8 x 5 college ruled memo pads and Bic ballpoint pens.

Yesterday was 16 years of not having missed a daily meditation session.

What I've learnt from meditating for 30 - 60 minutes each day for a month.,"EDIT: These are my personal thoughts and perspectives which I share to maybe help people. I'm not an authority on the Dhamma nor do I claim to be. Double check anything you read here with your own teachers/monks/nuns etc.

----------------------------

I've been able to maintain a regular meditation schedule for a month now and I thought I'd share some things I've learnt from it. Maybe someone will find this useful. If its important, I'm a Theravada Buddhist based in Australia. So here we go:

1. Happiness is within you not outside you.
2. Virtue is the foundation of meditation.
3. Carrying around the past, good and bad, is like holding on a to bloated carcass. It is better to drop it.
4. Worrying and thinking about the future is pointless as I have no control over it outside the present moment.
5. I am not my past, nor am I my future.
6. The majority of thoughts are quite useless and real joy comes from letting them go. I am not my thoughts.
7. Follow the joy when meditating
8. Be kind to yourself and to any problems that arise when meditating. Fighting them makes it worse.
9. Leave your ego at the door, there is nothing to attain, only things to abandon.
10. Setting alarms/goals for your meditation only leads to suffering. I am not worth more as a Buddhist if I meditate for 5 minutes or 50 minutes.
11. Only meditate for as long as you find it enjoyable. Forcing yourself to endure pain makes it a chore. Over many meditation sessions the amount of time you can meditate for will naturally increase as you find more and more joy in it.

In 3 hours I will be taking our old dog to be euthanized. Asking for prayers or chants I could offer to her both before or after her death.,"I realize that premature taking of life is not considered a good action in Buddhism, even if that being is suffering. But I'm not the only one making this decision, and, to be honest, it's hard to disagree. Regardless, I will accept the karmic consequences of this decision.

"Change is not HARD, your ATTACHMENT to your STORY is."," 

***I didn't intend to write a post this long, but i just kept writing what was going through my mind and what i felt will help someone out there let that be just 1 person, then my purpose with this post is fullfilled.***

Growing up we were accustomed, to let the outside world control the inside. To let what happens in our environment dictate how we think, feel and act. From a survival point of view, this is necessary, since when we are still at a young age, we don't have enough wisdom or power to make decisions and be responsible for our life, therefore we give the power to people we trust: Our family members, Teachers, any authority figures basically, to make decisions for us.

The problem is that this way of being, extend itself way being the time intended by nature to be. And we live the rest of our life, being always moved like a chess pawn according to the external world. Which as you guessed it, makes our life being blissful and directed as we want it to be, a very rare occasion that only happened accidentally.

Reality is in many ways like a TV Station, with an infinite number of channels playing simultaneously, each channel playing a certain show/content ( Life experience/ Life situation ). And this explains why people can live in the same home have the same parents and the same education, yet they are totally different and live in a totally different reality.

So we understand now that reality is not fixed or rigid as we may think of it. That reality is very fluid and malleable and that there is not one objective reality that we only experience, but its very subjective. Let's take an example to put this situation into perspective, imagine that there is rain outside and you love rain, but your friend hates rain. For you it is a great day, since it is raining because you love it, therefore your ""Thoughts, Feeling and Action'' about this situation are very positive. But your friend hates rain, so automatically, his ""Thoughts, Feelings and Actions'' towards this situation are negative and of miscontent. But the reality is seemingly the same for both, yet each one experience it in a totally different manner. This analogy of course is but the tip of the iceberg, the malleability of reality go way deeper than that and would require a whole post on it alone.

What i want to focus on today, is change. Why change seems so hard? If we take in consideration Quantum Physics and how there is infinite possibilities and outcomes then changes gotta be easy right? Well, it is. Then what makes it hard? : Our Attachment to the STORY we hold. It can be anything, from something that happened 20 years ago, to something that happened last week. The nature of the mind is to make assumptions, compare and classify each events. Which is an amazing job it does and help us tremendously to move through life and make the right decisions.

But the problem is that we become enslaved by our faculties. And what was a blessing become a curse. We become attached to what happened in the past, and the story we formed of whatever that situation is. And we now see life through these distorted lenses, which give us the illusion that what happened in the past will always happen in the future, and what didn't happen in the past can never happen in the future. So we start to form a story, about who we are and what the situation is and slowly but surely we become attached to this story and it becomes a part of who you are. For a lot of people change is not what is hard, it is the letting go of the story which truly frightens them. We become so attached to our illusions, that getting out of it, can seem as an identity suicide.

How many people do you know, that derive their whole meaning of life through an event that happened maybe 20 years ago? How many do you know that shaped their whole life, through the lenses of those events. The girl who was raped, who then became maybe a feminist who hated men and made all her life revolve around this event, how would you tell her to let go of this story? You literally asking her, to be naked. The guy who blame his alcoholic father who used to abuse him, for his failures and shortcomings, how would you tell him to let go of this story? Who would he blame now? How can he make sense of his suffering and project that outside to feel better about himself?

This is why change is so hard. Because we become so identified with the past, and our psychological drama. That letting go of it, threaten our whole existence. Imagine if you let go of all your beliefs, all your assumptions, all your prejudices. Do you even know who are you after that? This is exactly why we subconsciously try to reaffirm our stories, and biases. Very rarely can someone, really look directly into his soul, and see things for what they are.

YOU and ONLY YOU are responsible for your life. This is one of the hardest pill to swallow. I don't care about what happened to you 20 years ago or 5 minutes ago, there is nobody in this whole universe who can control this 3 aspects of you : How you Think, How you Feel, How you Act. and this 3 aspect are what create your reality. Getting back to the analogy of the TV Station, if all of life situations are merely different channels in a TV Station, then your ""Thoughts, Feeling and Actions'' are the remote control, with which you get to choose what channel is broadcasted to you ( what life experience you get ). How silly would you look like, if you go on scrolling through channels, then find a channel you don't like and start complaining about their shows and do everything you can to make the channel change its show, and you start playing the victim about how the channel have bad shows and make your life revolve around how bad the channel is, when you could just switch to another channel.

You see how silly it is, when looking at it from this point of view. But you are so immersed in your drama, that you never get to see the bigger picture and take a step back to see that you are like someone drowning in a bath. It is stupid and unnecessary. So whenever you meet with a channel that you don't like ( a life situation ). Do not try to change the shows of the channel, but change the channel altogether with your remote control : ""Thoughts, Feelings and Actions''. Your life then cannot only change but it MUST change.

There can be no other way, your reality and your ""Thoughts, feeling, actions'' are directly linked. There is no inconsistency with them. Like a TV Station, you can only broadcast one channel at a time. You can't hold negative thoughts and be blissful at the same time, it just can't and won't happen. The contrary is also true, you can't hold positive harmonious thoughts and still have a negative life.

So next time, whenever you are in a situation that you don't like, you know exactly what to do : Look Within. Simple! There can be no other way. Life is created from the inside out. This is why Indians Yogis and Buddhist Monks call life as an illusion or ""Maya''. Not that it doesn't exists, but it exists merely as a reflection of your inner state. It's like looking into a mirror, trying to change the reflection is stupid, you need to change the one who is reflected there: YOU! Notice when you feel happy and blissful how the whole world starts taking reflecting back that inner state to you? The color seems more vivid, the wind seems more gentle, life seems to flow at ease, people seems to be friendly. Notice also when you are anxious and in a state of fear how life also takes this shape? Life start to feel threatening, you start to feel insecure, bad things start to happen. It's not an accident it is designed this way.

So stop giving your attention to the noise outside, i don't care what happen in the external world coronavirus, world war 3, the apocalypse, alien invasion, if your ""Thoughts, Feelings and Actions'' are harmonious you will go through life as smooth as butter and you will begin to really feel what it's like to be the creator of your reality, and be an Alchemist, turning lead into gold, misfortune into fortune, chaos into order.

Suggestion to tighten rules around suicide-related posts,"I've been on this sub on and off under different usernames for a long time and one thing I keep seeing that bothers me is the way suicide-related posts are handled.

There are many posts where the poster asks about Buddhist views on suicide and none of the answers are even remotely sensitive to the original poster's position.

Take [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/lwyzq8/how_is_suicide_seen_in_buddhism/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) for example. It only takes one click to find out that OP is suicidal. Yet not a single one of the comments attempts to check if OP is okay.

We can't solve the suicidality of strangers on this sub, its way outside of the scope of reddit. But the possibility that OP is suicidal needs to be taken into account in order to give a compassionate response. A suicidal person should be advised to speak to qualified people, be it senior monastics or psychiatrists. I don't know which is better because I don't have all the answers. None of us do.

There was another post at one point where a teenager whose friend killed herself asked if her friend is gonna be OK. I can't find it right now, but literally only one of 10ish commenters said something other than ""hurrdurr suicide bad"". I'll leave it for you to decide for yourself what would be compassionate to say to *a grieving child*.

So here's what I suggest:

1. Adding suicide to discouraged topics. This should cover all frequently asked ""What is the Buddhist view on suicide?"" and ""What will happen to my loved one who committed suicide?"" type questions. More nuanced scriptural discussion may be acceptable. Or not. I don't know.
2. A standard response could be sent to those who breach the rule. This response could include a list of resources to get help when you're suicidal or you think someone else is. And maybe a summary of the Buddhist view on suicide but not one that is too focused on hell. Someone who has just lost a loved one doesn't need to hear ""Oh, they're going to hell"". They need to hear that their loved one will get another chance. Someone who is suicidal needs to hear that there is hope and help available. And both need to be told that anything beyond a standard response is outside the scope of this sub. We're not psychiatrists or enlightened masters.

I don't have all of the specifics fleshed out since it's not really up to me. If such a rule did come into being, I imagine it would be a collaboration of different people. I just wanted to share these thoughts and make the suggestion.",Buddhism,1616602931.0,t3_mc9vpz,0.97,506

The Buddha describes one thing that deserves to be killed,"As she was standing to one side, a devata recited this verse to the Blessed One:

    Having killed what 	
        do you sleep in ease? 
    Having killed what 	
        do you not grieve? 
    Of the slaying of what one thing 	
        does Gotama approve? 

[The Buddha:]

    Having killed anger 	
        you sleep in ease. 
    Having killed anger 	
        you do not grieve. 
    The noble ones praise 
    the slaying of anger 	
        ‚Äî with its honeyed crest 	
        & poison root ‚Äî 
    for having killed it 	
        you do not grieve.

"Buddha: ""be aware of these four enemies disguised as friends""","""Young man, be aware of these four enemies disguised as friends: the taker, the talker, the flatterer, and the reckless companion.

""The taker can be identified by four things: by only taking, asking for a lot while giving little, performing duty out of fear, and offering service in order to gain something.

""The talker can be identified by four things: by reminding of past generosity, promising future generosity, mouthing empty words of kindness, and protesting personal misfortune when called on to help.

""The flatterer can be identified by four things: by supporting both bad and good behavior indiscriminately, praising you to your face, and putting you down behind your back.

""The reckless companion can be identified by four things: by accompanying you in drinking, roaming around at night, partying, and gambling.""

That is what the Buddha said.

Summing up in verse, the sublime teacher said:


    The friend who is all take,
    The friend of empty words,
    The friend full of flattery,
    And the reckless friend;

    These four are not friends, 
    but enemies;
    The wise understand this
    And keep them at a distance
    As they would a dangerous path.

Felt genuinely happy for the first time in years today,"I was just doing some casual meditation as well as some hand mudras and when I opened my eyes I one again felt content.

All the trees and grass and stuff were so vibrant and beautiful and the river going through my town was so fascinating. I wasn't caught up in my thoughts or emotions I was just content and fascinating by everything. I haven't felt this genuinely happy in probably years, but it's a very good feeling. When I was on my walk I started smiling because on one of the houses the Christmas lights were flickering in a particular way and it made me happy because it was fun to look at lol.

I started crying after my most difficult meditation,"Hello guys, hope you are okay.

Just wanted to share. Today I tried a kind of ""loving kindness"" meditation, but I made it up myself (at least I didn't see anything like that online). There were people in my life who left me with a lot of trauma, broken and helpless. I was bullied and mocked, abused and sexually assaulted. Today, I finally decided to let it go.

I made a list of everyone who has ever hurt me. Then I sat down, began to breathe deeply and mentally talk to each of them. I told them everything I had in mind, and then tried to look deeper and realize why did they do this to me. 

It was very difficult. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized... they all were broken too. They grew up in a cruel world and went through a lot of suffering. They hurt me not because it made them happy... but to ease their own sufferings. All they wanted was love, acceptance and understanding; to be happy and free. Just like me. 

It took time, but eventually I forgave them all, told them that I love them and wish them to be happy, healthy, and safe.

When I let them go, I started crying. I feel so relieved now, it was as if I had a heavy, poisonous stone in my chest, but now it's gone. All this hate... it didn't help them, it didn't help me, it was just... useless.

I really hope that at least some of them will find good therapists and will be able to find *real* happiness. And I'm really glad I found out about buddhism.

Losing My Dad to Tibetan Buddhism,"First of all I want to say that I love Buddhism. I am committed to meditation and practices of compassion. (Edit: I love Mingyur Rinpoche and this post is NOT about him) 
 
My (20ishF) dad (50ish) has recently become a follower of a well-known Tibetan Buddhism Rinpoche. This Rinpoche eats meat, has a taste for the most expensive whisky, which is all fine as this is apparently allowed in Tibetan Buddhism. He also has sex with prostitutes and befriends the local mafia, apparently all out of supreme compassion. 

It‚Äôs not unusual for my father to spend 10kUSD on him per month. Father has bought Rinpoche a car costing 40k, and the Rinpoche has consumed alcohol of equivalent value. But of course, father says it‚Äôs not about the money. He says that the Rinpoche is ‚Äúalready rich‚Äù, being from the Tibetan upper class, and he does not have any attachments or desires. 

Recently, my dad invited him to stay at our family home, where my underage sister also stays. This was done without my mother‚Äôs permission, and her being in another country for work, was unable to stop it. The first time I met this Rinpoche in our home, he stared at me sexually while his wife was right beside him. Then, when Rinpoche met a friend of mine, he said: ‚Äúoh, is didn‚Äôt know that you were such a beauty. What a shame; I‚Äôm too old. Anyways, I have two sons from different mistresses, because I‚Äôm too handsome to have just one son.‚Äù 

Oh, he has multiple mistresses and children from them too. The wife knows about this and she is okay with it. In fact, the Rinpoche said (bragged?) that his mistress is so beautiful that when he took her home, he made her do a spin and twirl in front of his wife. My dad also proudly proclaims that his behaviour is true to the Buddhist principle of ‚Äúnot hurting other beings‚Äù‚Äîsince the all the mistresses know about each other, nobody‚Äôs hurt. 

Well‚Äîyou might say, I‚Äôm ‚Äúhurt‚Äù. I‚Äôm uncomfortable in my own home. Right? My sister and I mostly hide in our rooms, and we plan to do so until they leave in a couple weeks. However, my dad replied that I merely do not have enough wisdom to understand how this is a compassionate act towards my path to enlightenment. I might die and never understand it, but in my next life, I will certainly benefit from it. From a layman‚Äôs viewpoint, you might say that my father does not care that his daughter is uncomfortable in her own house. But maybe I just don‚Äôt have enough wisdom?

The craziest thing is that when I searched online, this is all apparently within the rules of Tantric Tibetan Buddhism? You are supposed to submit to your teacher absolutely, and sometimes there is some bit of sex involved (not sure how exactly). Also, a lot of other famous Rinpoches seem to have said (according to my dad) that this Rinpoche currently in my home is a true enlightenment being, adding to my dad‚Äôs conviction to follow him. I want to emphasize this part because how could they endorse him?? My dad said: one enlightenment being recognizes another. They would not make a mistake. 

Anyways, my entire family is crushed. Emotionally, and financially taking a big hit too. Can someone help me make sense of my situation? Is this truly Tantric Buddhism?  My family is breaking down in front of my eyes, and I feel like I‚Äôm going insane.

Edit: I am not sharing the name of the Rinpoche right now for safety and legal reasons. I will consider sharing after he leaves my city (My dad invited him and paid for his tickets here). I will say that he is of Tibetan ethnic origin and is based in Taiwan.",Buddhism,1695369337.0,t3_16p4a4d,0.95,454

I love this story so much - I'm trying to learn not to mind what others think of me - I welcome any help!,"At one time the Buddha was staying near RƒÅjagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels‚Äô feeding ground.

The brahmin BhƒÅradvƒÅja the Rude heard a rumor that a  brahmin of the BhƒÅradvƒÅja clan had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in the presence of the ascetic Gotama. Angry and displeased  he went to the Buddha and abused and insulted him with rude, harsh  words. When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him:

‚ÄúWhat do you think, brahmin? Do friends and colleagues, relatives and family members, and guests still come to visit you?‚Äù

‚ÄúSometimes they do, Master Gotama.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you then serve them with fresh and cooked foods and savories?‚Äù

‚ÄúSometimes I do.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut if they don‚Äôt accept it, brahmin, who does it belong to?‚Äù

‚ÄúIn that case it still belongs to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn the same way, brahmin, when you abuse, harass, and attack us who do not abuse, harass, and attack, we don‚Äôt accept it. It still belongs to you, brahmin, it still belongs to you!

Someone  who, when abused, harassed, and attacked, abuses, harasses, and attacks  in return is said to eat the food and have a reaction to it. But we neither eat your food nor do we have a reaction to it. It still belongs to you, brahmin, it still belongs to you!‚Äù# # #

I realized it is a slight variation to the gift story where it is food instead which I actually like a lot better because he talks about ""if you don't eat the food, do you react to it?""

I love that consuming aspect of it - because we are consuming or taking in others thoughts and options of it.  But if we don't consume it / eat it / take it in then how would we get a reaction?

Feeling doomed after the realization of our endless cycle.,"After many years spent thinking about Buddha's teachings, suddenly, the realizations start to actually ""sink"" into my own perception: I am going in circles with endless rebirths. 

I feel overwhelmingly intimidated by this recently and so suddenly - even though I know the concept of rebirth and karma long ago since I was a child. Even as time (which is a product of our own construction) goes on, I feel as if it is merely an illusion.  I am ... stuck. 

It feels like the road we are traveling on (with occasional stops to refuel - rebirth) is endless and  that going further is pointless as it never stops. It is like the mirror which is shattered... but we still need it to see ourselves.

I know it sounds crazy but, how can I deal with this, fellow Buddhists? Thank you very much.

request for advice regarding my practice,"Hello, my friends

I've Already decided on tibetan buddhism but it's tough for me to actually walk the path because of certain constraints I have. 

Due to the fact that I'm still a teenager, I don't really have the freedom to go to the tibetan-buddhist temples or centres in singapore. I also can't really spend any money on any malas, statues or online courses. Only thing I can really spend money on is books. I also don't really have the luxury of being able to study under a teacher right now.

Right now, how do I walk the path of tibetan-buddhism within these constraints? How do I learn meditation practices like tonglen, vipassana, shamantha and metta in a way that is true to my specific sect which is tibetan buddhism without spending any money on courses, online or in person? 

I do have full internet access but do bear in mind that even my access to tibetan buddhist books might be indirectly restricted due to my parents, who might not want me spending too much time on something like religion and/or who might be afraid that this distracts me from my studies.

Again, I need a structured practice but it's hard to do so with so little resources. Would appreciate any advice :)

Presenting the Dharma on Social Media,"Please read this post entirely before responding in order to avoid any misunderstanding. I will try to make my intentions as clear as possible.

I am considering the possibility of setting up a social media channel in order to present the Dharma to anyone who stumbles upon it and is interested.

By 'presenting the Dharma' I specifically mean:
* Quoting Pali Canon Suttas and Mahayana Sutras.
* Mentioning useful books and online resources.
* Sharing personal experience (explicitly marked as being personal).

EDIT: I forgot to mention that I intentionally chose the word 'presenting' as in 'showing', 'sharing', 'replicating'. I am *not* speaking of *teaching* the Dharma.

I *do not* intend to do any of the following:
* Misrepresent myself as a qualified teacher.
* Misrepresent my personal views as Dharma.
* Attack other traditions or religions.
* Making money in any shape or form.
* Using unskillful methods to boost engagement (e.g. baiting people with false promises or intentionally evoking intense emotions).
* Criticizing people or trying to pressure, change or convert them.

I love this story so much - I'm trying to learn not to mind what others think of me - I welcome any help!,"At one time the Buddha was staying near RƒÅjagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels‚Äô feeding ground.

The brahmin BhƒÅradvƒÅja the Rude heard a rumor that a  brahmin of the BhƒÅradvƒÅja clan had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in the presence of the ascetic Gotama. Angry and displeased  he went to the Buddha and abused and insulted him with rude, harsh  words. When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him:

‚ÄúWhat do you think, brahmin? Do friends and colleagues, relatives and family members, and guests still come to visit you?‚Äù

‚ÄúSometimes they do, Master Gotama.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you then serve them with fresh and cooked foods and savories?‚Äù

‚ÄúSometimes I do.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut if they don‚Äôt accept it, brahmin, who does it belong to?‚Äù

‚ÄúIn that case it still belongs to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn the same way, brahmin, when you abuse, harass, and attack us who do not abuse, harass, and attack, we don‚Äôt accept it. It still belongs to you, brahmin, it still belongs to you!

Someone  who, when abused, harassed, and attacked, abuses, harasses, and attacks  in return is said to eat the food and have a reaction to it. But we neither eat your food nor do we have a reaction to it. It still belongs to you, brahmin, it still belongs to you!‚Äù# # #

I realized it is a slight variation to the gift story where it is food instead which I actually like a lot better because he talks about ""if you don't eat the food, do you react to it?""

I love that consuming aspect of it - because we are consuming or taking in others thoughts and options of it.  But if we don't consume it / eat it / take it in then how would we get a reaction?

Feeling doomed after the realization of our endless cycle.,"After many years spent thinking about Buddha's teachings, suddenly, the realizations start to actually ""sink"" into my own perception: I am going in circles with endless rebirths. 

I feel overwhelmingly intimidated by this recently and so suddenly - even though I know the concept of rebirth and karma long ago since I was a child. Even as time (which is a product of our own construction) goes on, I feel as if it is merely an illusion.  I am ... stuck. 

It feels like the road we are traveling on (with occasional stops to refuel - rebirth) is endless and  that going further is pointless as it never stops. It is like the mirror which is shattered... but we still need it to see ourselves.

I know it sounds crazy but, how can I deal with this, fellow Buddhists? Thank you very much.

request for advice regarding my practice,"Hello, my friends

I've Already decided on tibetan buddhism but it's tough for me to actually walk the path because of certain constraints I have. 

Due to the fact that I'm still a teenager, I don't really have the freedom to go to the tibetan-buddhist temples or centres in singapore. I also can't really spend any money on any malas, statues or online courses. Only thing I can really spend money on is books. I also don't really have the luxury of being able to study under a teacher right now.

Right now, how do I walk the path of tibetan-buddhism within these constraints? How do I learn meditation practices like tonglen, vipassana, shamantha and metta in a way that is true to my specific sect which is tibetan buddhism without spending any money on courses, online or in person? 

I do have full internet access but do bear in mind that even my access to tibetan buddhist books might be indirectly restricted due to my parents, who might not want me spending too much time on something like religion and/or who might be afraid that this distracts me from my studies.

Again, I need a structured practice but it's hard to do so with so little resources. Would appreciate any advice :)

I am considering the possibility of setting up a social media channel in order to present the Dharma to anyone who stumbles upon it and is interested.

By 'presenting the Dharma' I specifically mean:
* Quoting Pali Canon Suttas and Mahayana Sutras.
* Mentioning useful books and online resources.
* Sharing personal experience (explicitly marked as being personal).

EDIT: I forgot to mention that I intentionally chose the word 'presenting' as in 'showing', 'sharing', 'replicating'. I am *not* speaking of *teaching* the Dharma.

I *do not* intend to do any of the following:
* Misrepresent myself as a qualified teacher.
* Misrepresent my personal views as Dharma.
* Attack other traditions or religions.
* Making money in any shape or form.
* Using unskillful methods to boost engagement (e.g. baiting people with false promises or intentionally evoking intense emotions).
* Criticizing people or trying to pressure, change or convert them.
* Engage in fruitless online discussions.
* Pursuing fame or recognition.
* Starting a new school, let alone a cult.

I am also well aware of what awaits me if I slander the Dharma or cause division in a Sangha.

In short, I intend to present the Dharma in accordance with the Dharma.

Please also note that I am not expecting anything from this. I am not emotionally attached to this project. I just want to use my abilities and means to do what's skillful.

Buddhisms view on Electronics and Mirrors,"So i think in the new age spiritual philosophy electronics are seen as problematic and to be treated with caution. I can see why, one can easily get lost in media and the comfort of machines that do everything, but with an old tradition like buddhism these things didnt exist back in the day. Is there a clear view on these things from a buddhist perspective, are they just another layer of maya ? nothing more then material illusions ?

Another question i have is that of how mirrors are seen. in the european thought the view in mirrors mostly seems to come from the mythos of narcissus who falls in love with his own redlection and drowns in the water in which he sees his reflection, we still call people narcistic who keep looking at their reflection. Is there from a buddhist view a reason to avoid looking at oneself in the mirror ? of course a mirror shows you a body that you inhabit, but i think there is another layer of self realisation in it, as some animals and young humans can recognize a body in a mirror, but not themselves.

One thing I am struggling with is finding a sangha to connect with in person. I have been quite lonely for several months where I live, which is why I find it a bit important to find an IRL sangha.

I live in Newcastle upon Tyne, and I thought it would be easy to find a Buddhist temple/centre there, but they are all either Trinatra, NKT or Diamond Way.

‚ÄúClearly, chief, I‚Äôm not getting through to you when I say:
‚ÄòEnough, chief, let it be. Don‚Äôt ask me that.‚Äô
Nevertheless, I will answer you.

When a warrior strives and struggles in battle, their mind is already low, degraded, and misdirected as they think:
‚ÄòMay these sentient beings be killed, slaughtered, slain, destroyed, or annihilated!‚Äô
His foes kill him and finish him off, and
when his body breaks up, after death, he‚Äôs reborn in the hell called ‚ÄòThe Fallen‚Äô.

But if you have such a view:
‚ÄòSuppose a warrior, while striving and struggling in battle, is killed and finished off by his foes. When his body breaks up, after death, he‚Äôs reborn in the company of the gods of the fallen.‚Äô This is your wrong view.
An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places, I say:
hell or the animal realm.‚Äù

When he said this, Dustin the warrior chief cried and burst out in tears.

‚ÄúThis is what I didn‚Äôt get through to you when I said:
‚ÄòEnough, chief, let it be. Don‚Äôt ask me that.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúSir, I‚Äôm not crying because of what the Buddha said.
But sir, for a long time I‚Äôve been cheated, tricked, and deceived by the warriors of the past who were teachers of teachers, who said:
‚ÄòSuppose a warrior, while striving and struggling in battle, is killed and finished off by his foes. When his body breaks up, after death, he‚Äôs reborn in the company of the gods of the fallen.‚Äô

Excellent, sir! Excellent!
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what‚Äôs there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways.
I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Sa·πÖgha.
From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.‚Äù",Buddhism,1705775975.0,t3_19biize,0.8,6
Symbolism of ‚Äòwolves‚Äô and one‚Äôs energy ‚Äòfeeling as though it was from the earth‚Äô?,"
I went to a 7 day meditation retreat and my teachers repeatedly talked of the wolves they saw in me and which I may fee. Another symbol that was through in was that the way I shared felt very grounded and natural: ‚Äòearthy‚Äô is a word that came up a lot.

I have kind of ran through life with blinkers on having come from a ‚Äòtraumatic‚Äô history, but always forgetting about my past through distraction, giving into ‚Äòcravings‚Äô and busyness. Which has led to addiction and repeating sad ‚Äòtraumas‚Äô I have been in AA and another 12 step for a while.

I would be eternally grateful if anyone could shine a light on what‚Äôs meant by the wolves I‚Äôm feeding and what they see as my nature appearing ‚Äòearthy‚Äô. I have struggled trying to find information from researching alone.

Happy to share more about experience/ background and what led me there, but don‚Äôt want to overwhelm and aware that I have been unskillful in my arrival to Buddhism out of sheer curiousity and spooky coincidences rather than mindfully or in a well thought concentrated manner. 

Hope that no one is disrespected by my ignorance to the practice. I coming with curiousity and a place of playfulness and love.

i sometimes think about doing shrooms/lsd but im afraid it is a bad idea (bad trips, confusion, hallucinogen persisting perception disorder, etc)

i was always into self observation/reflection and diving deep into ourselves. im really into buddhism and meditation lately. i always had a LOT of thoughts about our consciouness, ego, being present and how our thoughts and state of mind affect our reality, i always discussed that with friends and almost all of my friends into hallucinogens said that they had those exact thoughts when tripping. i really wonder how far i could go when tripping if i do this when sober. also some of people i admire like ram dass, who researched it and used it a lot.  i wonder if it could benefit me, im really afraid of it causing problems, like that disorder, instead of helping me reach my goal. that happens to some people. i think i would go really paranoid about ""im still tripping, everythings not real"" if i had those hallucinations even when sober for like days, weeks, months. idk. i dont know if i should take a chance cause its worth or that could really f me up. im good where i am right now, i dont NEED those experiences, but i would really like to if they were good for me. what would you guys do?",Buddhism,1705738615.0,t3_19b70mq,0.76,36

5) How would you want others to address your faith? Including caregivers/healthcare workers if you were to see them?

How does your personal practice help others?,"Please read this post entirely before answering in order to avoid misunderstanding. I will try to be as clear as possible. Also, please don't read 'between the lines' because I don't think or write that way. Thank you!

In my limited experience, most Buddhist practices focus on liberating oneself. I have only recently begun my practice and have already noticed a significant, positive change, helping me to stay calm in previously stressful situations and allowing me to regain focus when I find myself trapped in unwholesome thoughts.

This change in my behavior also seems to slightly positively effect people in my surroundings. Since I am a beginner and have little knowledge and experience, this observation has led me to the following question:

How does *your personal* practice help other people?

Please note the following clarifications:

* I am explicitly asking about *your personal* practice, i.e. the way you as an individual choose to apply Buddhist teachings. Please respect everyone's personal accounts and focus on what's uniting instead of looking for aspects that divide.

* This is a question meant exactly as it is worded. It is *not* a judgemental statement or an attempt to manipulate, convince, criticize, blame, misrepresent, divide or anything else unwholesome.

* I am also not talking about wanting to change others, converting others to Buddhism or unsolicitedly pestering them. This question is aimed solely at your perspective and experience.

* This question is not about me! I'm happy with my practice and I strive to learn more and improve. I am *not* in distress, I am just curious and like to hear from others!

* Once again, this question is not meant to *imply* anything! I believe that one's practice mainly needs to focus on oneself and should not depend on others.

I am merely asking because I noticed this effect in my personal practice and was wondering if you experienced something similar (or maybe something completely different).

Looking for a particular type of book,"I used to have a little library of Buddhist books that I would recommend to others.

I would love to give a book about Buddhism to an elderly woman I know who I'd very spiritual. She is actually a Christian. I don't want to convert her. I just think she could benefit from some of the teachings about living in the here and now. She doesn't have any awareness of the concept of choosing her focus, of attachment as a concept, of our relationship to expectations, or of letting go of things that bring us suffering. 

I don't know if she will be interested. She is not much of a reader. But I think it would be a meaningful gift that she might read out of curiosity if I gave it to her.

Dealing with (justifiable) anger,"Hello,

How do you deal with ""justifiable"" anger?

I am, by nature, not an angry person. Since beginning to practice Dhamma and Buddhist teachings, I am even more self aware, and if I feel greed, anger or  ignorance present, I am usually quick to catch it early and meditate upon it.

A person entrusted with my childs care did something very malicious. I witnessed it. They are denying having done it, with it being my word against theirs.

I am angry, and I am having difficulty suppressing feelings of revenge and/or vindication. They could lose their job if I take it further. I have searched for compassion and understanding within myself, I have questioned my ego (as it pertains to revenge / vindication), but I am not still or calm inside.

Thinking of converting from Nihilism to Buddhism,"Just like the title says. I think I want to become Buddhist, but I have no idea where to begin. At least I want to study what it entails more in-depth than what I learned in my high school world history class. Help would be greatly appreciated

My story: I was originally raised southern baptist Christian in the Bible Belt. There were good people in the 2-3 churches I attended throughout my childhood, but Christianity just always made me feel uncomfortable throughout life and many people were very judgmental // condescending. It always felt like some sort of cult. Especially with the influence it holds here in the United States.

Since I became an ‚Äúadult‚Äù and graduated high school and went off to college, I‚Äôve been kind of lost and wandering with my spirituality. I considered myself agnostic at this point. Going back to Christianity crossed my mind many times and I tried other churches, but it always just left a bad taste in my mouth. So then I heard about and tried self-guided Christianity. Couldn‚Äôt come to terms with that either. So eventually I came to this mindset that what if just absolutely nothing happened after death. Like poof just blackness. Nothingness. I eventually learned afterwards that was called nihilism and that there were two types: the ‚Äújust don‚Äôt try‚Äù kind and the ‚Äúmake the most of what you‚Äôve got‚Äù kind. Safe to say I stuck to the second one. This has worked the best for me, but it still feels like there‚Äôs gotta be something. Like I don‚Äôt believe that people don‚Äôt have spirits, and that directly contrasts with nihilism. I just don‚Äôt know what to believe about what happens with said spirits. This is where my idea of maybe the whole reincarnation thing with Buddhism might work as a faith for me.

Idk I guess I just want to be able to believe that all it really takes is being a nice/good person and not being a POS to others is all it takes for good to come to you. I want a faith to believe, I want to know if Buddhism can work for me, and I would love any suggestions on where to start if so. Thanks much!",Buddhism,1705712810.0,t3_19azd8f,0.78,7

"Question on Pureland, Amitabha, and Handheld Tibetan Prayer Wheels","So, I have questions. I wanted to question the validity of some statements too.

1. This video: https://youtu.be/vjW82VJXkQY?si=ZzwGyvcxGxjK1sUJ&t=543 it states that if you were to think up this Buddha (Amitabha) or simply call upon the name of this Buddha, even 10 times, they‚Äôll be able to attain rebirth in the pureland in their next life. Is that true? Does this have to be done daily or? Just recite his name 10 times once?

2. In the book The Wheel of Great Compassion by Larne Ladner and Lama Zopa Rinpoche, on page viii, it says, ‚ÄúThey gave me one, and I offered it to the king of Nepal. The Nepalese king asked me whether he should keep it. I said ‚ÄúYes, and if you have this prayer wheel next to you at the time of death, then your consciousness will be reborn in a pure land of Buddha.‚Äù‚Äù My question is: is that true? If you have a prayer wheel with you at the time of death, you‚Äôll be born in a pure land of Buddha? Which Buddha?

3. Will recitation of Amitabha‚Äôs name conflict with if you have a Tibetan Prayer Wheel with you at the time of death? Will it be possible to recite Amitabha‚Äôs name 10 times, have a prayer wheel with you at the time of death, and then be born into another Buddha‚Äôs pureland?",Buddhism,1705706330.0,t3_19awx8t,0.86,5
Skillful Reaction to Hateful Speech against others,"When it comes to Right Speech, how can one react skillfully when talking to someone who is making hateful or dehumanizing comments about others (e.g. minorities or marginalized people)?

**First example**
You're visiting a relative and they unsolicitedly start making dehumanizing jokes about the slaughter of a local minority group.

Calmly pointing out that these specific jokes are not funny did not really work because the relative felt attacked and later even repeated the exact same jokes.

You have an acquaintance over for coffee and - again unsolicitedly - they say that people who rescue refugees from drowning are criminals that should be put in jail.

Asking them what they would do if they saw someone drowning, appealing to their compassion, was a dead end.

Review of From Here to Enlightenment: an Introduction to Tsongkhapa's Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment,"Review of From Here to Enlightenment: an Introduction to Tsongkhapa's Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment

Hello, here are my thoughts on this book. Don't get upset.

The reason I put that sort of obvious title is because that is something you should know about this book. It is the Dalai Lama explaining the aforementioned text. He says it is his main guide and he likes it very much. I like his explanations of it very much too. The Dalai Lama here writes very clearly and what you should do and what is necessary to attain enlightenment and details the steps and practices and philosophies. It is more directive than some of his other texts, by which I mean that in this text he tells you what to do, while in others he just examines what is good etc. One last thing you should know is that he has written several books examining Tsongkhapa's works. Tsongkhapa made the small, medium, and great treatises, and I think the Dalai Lama wrote books on each of those, maybe several books on each. My point there is that many of his books deal with the same subject, so you might want to pick the best one, instead of reading all.

**For three generations my family are vegetarians. I have been a vegetarian since I was young. I learn the Buddha Dharma and I also uphold the Bodhisattva precepts. But my brother Hu Xue Hui does not have faith in the Buddha. He is a heavy smoker, a drunken person, with many bad habits. It is impossible to change him. I do not even dare to advise him to take refuge in the Triple Gem, what is more to ask him to uphold the precepts, to practise the Dharma. I was very worried for him.**

**In the year 2002, my brother was already seventy years old. Because of his bad habits, he was infected with the last stage of lung cancer. I thought maybe it was the right time to exhort him to recite Namo Amitabha Buddha. I dared not tell him about a change in his habitual way of life. Anyway, he did listen to me and recited Namo Amitabha Buddha at home sincerely. At times he would also visit the temple to pray to the Buddha.**

**In the year 2004, the 4th day of the 10th Lunar month, my brother phoned me up, asking me to go over. When I arrived, my brother looked fine. We recited Namo Amitabha Buddha together. I felt very strange because my brother was quite excited that day. We continued to sit on the bed to recite Namo Amitabha Buddha. At midnight, my brother said, ‚ÄòAmitabha Buddha is coming to bring me back.‚Äô**

**He sounded so relax. I simply could not believe in his words. This is because I know him thoroughly. He has so many bad habits. He did not even take refuge in the Buddha basically. He did not abide by the five precepts. He did recite Namo Amitabha Buddha but he did not even know about the transference of merits. So, will Amitabha Buddha come to welcome him in such a condition? I am not a good practitioner either. But I am still very much better than him. But I have not heard from Amitabha Buddha and I do not know when he will come to welcome me! So, when I heard that he was leaving with Amitabha Buddha, I could not believe it at all.**

**I was thus thinking but I still insisted to recite Namo Amitabha Buddha with him until early in the morning, that is the fifth day of the tenth Lunar month. My brother said, ‚ÄòYou see, Amitabha Buddha is here. I am leaving.‚Äô**

**Urgently I asked, ‚ÄòWhere is He?‚Äô¬† As I was sitting opposite to him while reciting Namo Amitabha Buddha, he pointed at my back and said, ‚ÄòHe is there‚Äô I quickly turned my head to take a close look but I did not see anything. I used my hand to pull at him and asked, ‚ÄòWhere is Amitabha Buddha? Where is Amitabha Buddha?‚Äô I asked him twice continually but I could not move him. There is no answer either. Suddenly I turned back and looked at him. I was really shocked. My brother was right. Amitabha Buddha had already come and brought him along.**

**The time taken from the instance I turned my head and looked back was only a few seconds. But my brother had already attained a rebirth, still sitting there. At that instant, I was so joyful yet my heart was very sad. My face was wet with tears.**

**My sister-in-law was upstairs and she heard our voice. She descended from the staircase and asked, ‚ÄòWhat are you two talking about? Your loud voice had woken me up.‚Äô I told her, ‚ÄòAmitabha Buddha has already brought my brother home‚Äô**

**She said tearfully, ‚ÄòBut wasn‚Äôt he still talking just now?‚Äô**

**‚ÄòYes, you are right. Amitabha Buddha is truly kind and compassionate. Please do not cry. Let us recite Namo Amitabha Buddha to send him to Pure Land.‚Äô**

**So, in this way, our whole family recited Namo Amitabha Buddha. After eight hours, we cleaned up his body and changed clothes for him. Brother‚Äôs body was very soft and he looked so nice. After three days, many people came to the funeral to have a look at him. They said that they had never seen such a handsome death man. Among the relatives, a few of them are touched by his death and they have started to recite Namo Amitabha Buddha.**

**Reflecting on this incidence, my brother should have known that he was going to attain a rebirth when he phoned me up. But he did not say anything. Maybe he knew that I would not believe in him. At mid-night, the fourth day, he said Amitabha Buddha was coming to bring him home. Maybe this is a signal for me. At that time, if I were to ask him, maybe he would tell me more. The problem is that I do not believe in him. That is why I did not bother to ask anything. Finally, when he said that the Buddha was there and it took only a few seconds for him to leave. I simply had no chance to ask any question. I am very regretful thinking about this. If I could believe in him earlier, and asked him what he had seen, asked for his opinions, it would be the best.**

**Anyway, my brother had left, in the most carefree way. He is the best example in the practice of Amitabha recitation to attain a rebirth. Truly speaking, he only knows the recitation of Namo Amitabha Buddha. Other than this recitation he knows nothing.**

**My brother‚Äôs attainment of rebirth has truly shaken me up. I have learnt a lot from him. In fact, I often look down on him as he can only recite Namo Amitabha Buddha. Unlike me, he did not uphold the precepts, did not take vegetarian diet, did not take refuge. He knows nothing about Sutras, mantras or cultivation. I was thus thinking, thousands of people can attain a rebirth, millions of people can attain a rebirth but I did not think he can attain a rebirth. But his attainment of a rebirth was because of his exclusive recitation of Amitabha Buddha. And he had left in such a wonderful way. All the time I was thinking I was much better than him. Only now I realize that he was very much better than me by so many times.**

**He had set a good example that the attainment of a rebirth does not rely on one‚Äôs personal effort. It relies totally on the strength of Amitabha Buddha‚Äôs Vows. When we recite Namo Amitabha Buddha, Amitabha Buddha will surely rescue every one of us to his World of Ultimate Bliss, in the Western direction, without leaving anyone out. As people have said, the strength of a good example is inexhaustible. The attainment of rebirth by my brother had truly release me from all my doubts and worries. My faith was greatly enhanced. From now onwards, I will learn from my brother and let go of my egoistic self -effort. I will recite Namo Amitabha Buddha exclusively until my last breath. Namo Amitabha Buddha!**

Buddha statue,Around 6 years ago I got a call from an acquaintance of mine. His girlfriend was a diagnosable kleptomaniac.

And that i needs to come get it ASAP! He said he didn't want any trouble lol so I went over there and grabbed it. I wonder how wrong it is to have done that. I mean stealing from someone who stole something is still stealing right? What if it had been the case that I loved cycling and she stole a bike? Does it matter that it was a Buddha that it was stolen and it was being disrespected probably would have got broken or ended up somewhere weird? I know that's justifying.

Theravada and Mahayana,"Hey,

I‚Äôve read Mahayana buddhism first through Nagarjuna and then i‚Äôve read works on Zen (mainly Nishitani) and i‚Äôve read several sutras and a fair few works by Zen masters and poets. I‚Äôve also read the Dhammapada

One thing i‚Äôm confused about is this: Japanese Soto Zen buddhism seems to have a very this-world approach ‚Äî It disputes our conventional notions of this world and tries to collapse the distinction between this world and a supernatural ultimate reality, via dependent origination and interpenetration and interdependence etc. ‚Äî but it doesn‚Äôt seem overly focused on supernatural entities or other worlds/realms etc. 

What‚Äôs confused me is that it led me to think that Mahayana was more focused on a kind of experiential empiricism i always associated with the buddha, but upon further reading it seems like Theravada is more anti-metaphysical, more focused on experience as opposed to theories, less inclined to make metaphysical claims or posit other worlds and other beings, and that mahayana makes more claims

i‚Äôm asking because I like the idea of pursuing the way without needing lots of conditional metaphysical baggage ‚Äî i like the idea of non-attachment to views, a non-attachment that i saw as central to the buddha‚Äôs teachings. So the school that focuses more on experience as opposed to metaphysics will always be the school i‚Äôm drawn to. 

I thought i‚Äôd found this with Nagarjuna‚Äôs work, because it seemed like a kind of poetic anti-philosophy that imploded conventional categorisations and released me into a weird inbetweenness ‚Ä¶ zen koans had this effect on me too

But then mahayana sometimes seem to make a lot of metaphysical claims and posit a very particular being-centred ontology in terms of cosmic beings etc. ‚Äî you can see how confused i‚Äôm getting‚Ä¶. 

Are there similarities between Zen, Nagarjuna and Theravada that from some perspectives makes these three fit together? Or have i got it all mixed up‚Ä¶..",Buddhism,1705661807.0,t3_19agi6d,0.9,7
"Stupid question, but still would like to know","If someone who is a practicing Buddhist, is going through a lot in life, and is having a lot of mental problems, does the practice help relieve symptoms of the illness?

What I mean by does it help is, does it help relieve the symptoms of the illness, does right view, right intention, right speech, etc. Lessen the symptoms or at the very least the stress one is already experiencing. Or, is the effort put forth, despite the pain and suffering, just causing more stress than there already is because the effort is stressful while in a state of depression, anxiety, psychosis, what have you,  and would it then just be easier to give in to anger since that would flow more naturally then the stress created by resisting it with kindness to self and others?",Buddhism,1705674174.0,t3_19ak7v7,1.0,3

Boosting Vipassana,"Earlier in vipassana meditation, I used to struggle to know if I am craving/having aversion towards any pleasant/unpleasant sensation. 

Recently with other spiritual discourses, I learnt the following truth about life

""Our experience of life (either pleasant/unpleasant) is determined solely by us"". Not even the devine has a say in it. That's how the creator made us.

In brief, whatever my be the situation we may always choose to remain pleasant and work with whatever is in our hands. It doesn't matter what the result is because we are anyway pleasant. This let's us to be free of fear, suffering and leads us to do our best without any anxiety.

So I used this while doing vipassana and it seemed like earlier, we are unconsciously searching for ""how to be?"" during vipassana (other times too). Now that we have decided to be pleasant. So only remaining work is to observe the sensations. Also when we are pleasant or happy by self it seemed we don't crave or have aversion for anything including sensations.....",Buddhism,1705669392.0,t3_19ailvw,1.0,3

Breaking the clinging to the 5 Aggregates - Different methods across cultures,"I've been looking at the world and the various people in the world for hints of enlightenment, and reading many holy books and literature, thinking about ways different religions and groups might cease clinging to the 5 aggregates through their practices and beliefs.  


The Buddha identified the 5 clinging aggregates as a short summation of what leads us to suffering when discussing the 4 noble truths.  


""In brief, the 5 aggregates subject to clinging are suffering""

&#x200B;

The 5 Aggregates are:

1. Form (Body)

2. Feeling (Like/Dislike/Neutral)

3. Perception

4. Formations (Volitional Constructs, i.e. Will)

5. Consciousness (Dual Knowledge?)

&#x200B;

In examining Christianity, I noticed there's an egoic protection gifted to people through God. A good Christian is supposed to turn their will over to God. The buddha said that to cease clinging to one aggregate is to cease clinging to all aggregates. So I realized that perhaps Christianity is a method of achieving enlightenment, by letting go of the 4th aggregate.  


In Zen Buddhism, they will give Koans to buddhist disciples, and I believe that when done properly, the contemplation of a koan will lead to the breaking of the aggregate of perception (though it could be formations or consciousness - I'm not sure, despite studying these 5 words for hundreds of hours).  


The buddha gave us 4 mindfulness meditations that I think are designed to facilitate breaking the clinging to the aggregates as well. To meditate on the body (form). To meditate on our feelings. To meditate on our mental state (perception). And to orient our will around achieving enlightenment, meditating on select teachings of the buddha.  


Has anyone ever thought about this and found other examples in other cultures?

1. I fear that someone will read my angry words and it will increase their own hate
2. I fear that saying bad things about people is bad

But.

The other option is to keep it inside.  I am almost entire sure this is wrong.  Holding harmful experiences inside is damaging.

I have explored other ideas like *it's my karma to have these bad feelings* but that seems like more victim mentality from my C-PTSD.

I am pretty sure I deserve happiness just like anyone else.  I am pretty sure that no one *deserves* bad things (karma arguments?) and that suffering and not being permitted to free that anger is wrong.

Then again, that sounds a lot like my childhood (suffering and *not being permitted* to do anything about it.

**Questions:**

To what extent am I generating bad karma by yelling/screaming/searing at my mom (in private) to let out the anger?

To what extent am I generating bad karma by posting it online (it's anonymous, I'm not naming her)?  My goal for this is twofold:  First, to get validation that what I experienced was bad.  Second, so other people don't feel alone if they're experiencing the same.

To what extent am I generating bad karma by posting recordings of my rants online (anonymous, of course, I'm not naming her)?  My goals for this are the same as above.

I can speak from experience that *reading about* other people's experiences has been validating to me.  It has made me a more peaceful person, not toward my mom, but toward society in general.  *Other people experienced it to... it is wrong*.

Rather than keeping it all inside and wondering exactly I did wrong to deserve such bullshit.

I'm interested in answers to the questions above, and not about ""soul contracts"" or other such rationalizing the abuse type answers.

Furthermore, I am not interested in platitudes like ""bad thoughts cause people's bad words, bad words lead to bad actions, etc.""  I highly doubt anyone will read what I write and attack somebody.  I more likely believe that someone will read what I write and *feel validated and heard*, creating peace in their life.

The more I think about it, the more Buddhism seems like I am just supposed to *suffer and take it.*

I am also not interested in forgiving.  Do not confuse, I am not talking about carrying a grudge.  But *forgiving* implies ""oh, you abused me, but that's ok, we can still interact *because it's family""* or other such nonsense.

I have been tolerant my entire life.  It has caused undue burden and strain and distress.  I was never allowed to, nor did I even know it was possible, to have a voice  I did not know I didn't have to just *endure the abuse*.  My goal moving forward, to heal myself, is to not do that anymore.

Furthermore, I have spent most of my life parentified by my mom (""parentified"" is a term meaning when the child is responsible for the emotional regulation of the parent, which is the converse of what it's supposed to be.  Parents are supposed to help children develop mentally well.  But my childhood was spent controlling my mom's moods to make sure she was happy, therefore I can be safe).  I constantly put other people before myself because I am SO AFRAID of people being in bad moods, because my entire childhood was spent being afraid of my mom if she wasn't in a good mood.

I finally realized a lot of this stuff is wrong.  I do not know how to express it without concern of creating bad karma.

I assume I made myself clear.",Buddhism,1705610356.0,t3_19a06ae,0.78,8
"I'm 29, Severely Disabled, And My Mom Has Tumors (Just Learned They're Benign! :D). Buddhism Is Helping.","Today I heard my mother was sick and I cried like a baby. But, after listening to videos and redditting about Buddhism for a month or so, I've built a certain detachment from suffering, and so I stopped the crying the same day. We then learned that her tumors are benign and will likely never give her cancer. Before I stopped the crying I was making deals with my old God: ""Please, I'll enter the church just spare her!"", but it was pointless to hold on to a hopless cause, she'll pass away far in the future, but she will pass away, no matter how much I love my family, they will all leave this world, and I will to. My grandfather passed away about nine years ago, and he brings warm memories whenever he comes back into my thoughts. I loved him so much, and I lost him, but he's in another life now, and he died a changed, good man. I can only hope for my family to build a temple of good Karma in their lives so that they find an end to suffering, and I wish the same for myself.

Gravity really is the best analogy to Kamma/Karma!,"I made a post on this sub a while ago questioning the subscribers on why there is such a thing as The Five Great Sins/Evils, which are said to lead one straight to Naraka (hell). I was quite satisfied with the insightful answers I got and I felt I understood the matter. Then on yesterday, I woke up in the middle of a stormy night with a thought: if we compare the laws of Kamma to the laws of Gravity, the principles that govern both are extremely similar. I KNOW this isn't a new idea. Many before me have compared these two universal laws. But I'll share a few of my thoughts I haven't seen articulated in this manner elsewhere. 

‚óè On the matter of the Five Great Sins, committing matricide, patricide, killing a monk, killing a Buddha or splitting up a Sangha are kind like jumping off a tall building: even if regret what you've done afterwads, YOU MUST STILL TAKE THE FALL. This is why, regardless of whether or not you come to repent later on, YOU WILL BE REBORN IN NARAKA for committing those crimes. Kamma is both intention AND action, so a change of heart can only prevent one from committing/experiencing negative Kamma in the future, but DOESN'T NEGATE the energy of past actions: they will manifest until that energy ends.

‚óè Kamma is an inescapable, impartial, indifferent, non-judgemental force, which is very in line with the concept of gravity. 

‚óè Kamma isn't inherently good or bad--those are distinctions we make up to describe results that lead to happiness or suffering. Much in the same way, gravity is not inherently good or bad. For instance, teering on a fence will likely make you fall and hurt yourself--it's an unskillful action leading to an unpleasant result. But using gravity to make a siphon or set up a satellite can solve many problems--skillful actions that results in happiness. 

‚óè A drop of bad Kamma in a lake of good Kamma is not nullified, but gets ""diluted"" so that it is not as bad--in this case, bad Kamma is still like gravity making you fall, and the good Kamma is like having a parachute or a very soft surface underneath: it will minimise the impact. 

‚óè Learning the Dharma, is like learning parkour: you learn to better control your balance and jump over obstacles, but also how to land gracefully in case you do fall. 

‚óè The Kamma of our minds is like gravity pushing a river: technically, the water isn't bound by the riverbed and can escape, but the trend is that it will follow the river's course--this is why it's difficult to destroy our vices and bad habits--it's like swimming against the current, against gravity :)

Reflection on Samsara and the Wheel of Life,"So I was watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WPjlUkTuDU) on Samsara and the illustration of the Wheel of Life and I had a thought that I wanted to share in case anyone else has any reflections etc. 

During the video, the speaker mentions in passing that the realms could be beyond our world **or** they could be representations of our existence. 

I think that it makes perfect sense that the realms can be representations of our existing lives.

I mean just consider the hub (the three poisons) and the outer layer of the hub (Karma). When we live by the three poisons, our actions will be coloured by them, meaning the reactions to our actions are mirrored and we end up in either of these realms. If we are addicted we will constantly find ourselves (mostly) in the realm of hungry ghosts (interesting side note: Gabor Mate, a famous psychologist, published a book titled ""In The Realm of Hungry Ghosts"" which is about addiction), always wanting more than we can consume and can never fill ourselves. If our life goes by perfectly we end up in the God Realm, having everything we could possibly want but still not reaching enlightenment. 

This would also mean that not only is the Eightfold Path the Middle Path, but existence itself is best in the middle, since the human realm is on the middle level (or close enough) of Samsara and the human realm is where we can reach enlightenment.

Now I'll admit, this reflection is flawed since it doesn't point to the obvious point of the Wheel of Life: Birth and rebirth, since we are reborn into these realms and eventually out of this wheel. This reflection only considers the wheel's application on existence.

I would love to hear what anyone else thinks.

Death vs Nirvana for Secular Buddhists,"Note: I'm not fully convinced or unconvinced of this narrative, but I'd like to hear other perspectives because the logical conclusion of this seems quite fatal. 

Materialism seems to be the worldview we are converging upon with more advances in neuroscience and other areas. A subjective mental life apart from physical processes in the brain seems to be harder and harder to justify. Preliminary studies are showing our ability to extract ideas and music from electrical impulses, which seems crazy to think. 

Buddhist philosophy seems compatible with materialism regarding non-self and dependent origination. The concept of the ""self"" as a product of a series of impersonal processes seems to be the case in both worldviews. Buddhism just seems to take an experiential viewpoint of the nature of reality as opposed to the third-person intellectual view of science. 

The problem is that under materialism, the self and suffering are extinguished with the destruction of the body. After all, without a mental life independent of physical processes, what could reincarnate? 

If somebody is secular, what reason is there for the Eightfold Path if death is an easier solution? One reason I see is that living allows one to reduce suffering for other living beings. Another argument is that nirvana would be a mistake in neither world view while death would be an error if there is reincarnation, so the Eightfold Path is valuable in all cases.

But both of these arguments are indirect reasons for living. Normally, ontological questions are understandably quite futile in Buddhism, but this seems important because it directly corresponds to the correct way to reduce suffering.

The Three Requests are Answered,"## [The Three Requests are¬†Answered](https://oridharma.wordpress.com/2018/08/12/your-mean-that-butterfly-is-our-mother/)

üì∑

Three days after the funeral, the eldest son was sleeping upstairs. His two brothers were reciting the Buddha Name for their mother. Suddenly they saw a butterfly flew into the house. One of them took a fan and started to hit at it. Their niece saw this and quickly she ran upstairs to wake up her father, the eldest son in the family, ‚ÄòPapa, papa, please be quick. Uncles are hitting the butterfly. It could be grandmother.‚Äô

He quickly went down to stop his brothers from hitting the butterfly.

The 2nd son asked, ‚ÄòVery strange! Brother, didn‚Äôt you say our mother is born in the pure land. Now you say the butterfly is mother. That is the animal realm!‚Äô

The third son also nodded in agreement.‚Äò

It is winter time and not many butterflies can be found. Let us conduct an experiment.‚Äô

The eldest son said, ‚ÄòButterfly, if you are mother‚Äôs transformation, please fly and land on my hand.‚Äô

Sure enough, the little butterfly flew towards him and rested on his palm.  
‚ÄòMother, are you really born in the pure land? Do show us. ‚Äô The eldest son said again. The little insect flew up towards the lighted lotus flower lantern on the Buddha altar and landed in the middle of the lotus. The three sons were confirmed that it was their mother.

The third son said, ‚ÄòMother, when you are alive, you asked me to bring you upstairs to see the place. I did not do it because I was afraid that you might fall and get wounded. Now, can you land on my head and I will bring you upstairs?‚Äô

The butterfly flew and landed on the tip of his head. He walked carefully up the shaking wooden stairs, walked one round on the moving planks on the first floor and came down slowly. After touching the ground floor, the butterfly flew away.

This was the story told by the eldest son in the family at Zhong Pu.

Mr. Huang invited him to give a talk to an audience on the three responses he received when his mother passed away.

His mother was down with the cancer of nose and throat. Her whole face was in a mess of rotten flesh and pus and she smelled more like a rotten corpse. Luckily she had three good sons who did not leave her when she was so sick, that she could not even lie on her bed to take a sleep. She could only rest on the table to take a nap when she was too tired.

The eldest son was working in the Buddhist articles circulation centre. In the family, he and his wife were Buddhists as the two young brothers did not have faith in the Dharma. So when the mother was so sick, the eldest son pleaded her to recite the Buddha‚Äôs Name. In such sufferings she believed and started to recite Amitabha Buddha. Her sickness deteriorated but there was no pain. The eldest son pleaded her to become a vegetarian but she stubbornly refused.

His good friend from Jia Yi County, Mr Huang also came to counsel her. She would recite Amitabha silently as she was unable to talk. After talking to her he found that the old lady had seen Amitabha Buddha three times. When she was asked why she did not go, she just shook her head. She was not ready!

Mr Huang was the disciple of Master Jian Yin. So he invited his Shifu to give her the counselling. He drove the Venerable to the deep mountain, to a village called Mei Shan under the Jade Mountain. After many meandering, the Venerable felt quite uncomfortable and said, ‚ÄòGoodness, the road is so terrible. It is good enough if you come here alone to counsel her. Why are you asking me?‚Äô

The disciple answered, ‚ÄòShifu, the Buddha came three times and yet she still refused to leave. That is why I have to carry you personally to see her.‚Äô

After listening to this, Venerable Jian Yin was greatly ashamed of himself. He said, ‚ÄòAmitabha Buddha came three times without any complain and here I am coming for the first time and already complaining about the terrible states of the road. What a shame!‚Äô So he gave rise to a mind of great repentance, thinking of his lacking in compassion when compared to the Buddha.

When they arrived at the small house which was built during the Japanese time, the Venerable saw the address was Shui Dao Tou. He entered the room and immediately smelled the stench of the sick woman. It was like the stink of a corpse, but no, she was still alive, only that the face was less than the face of a human as it was covered with blood and pus, with pieces of flesh here and there.

The Venerable asked, ‚ÄòOld Bodhisattva, I heard that you have seen Amitabha Buddha three times, right?‚Äô She could hear but she could not answer, only nodded her head.

‚ÄòSo, why did not you go with Him?‚Äô the Venerable continued to ask.  
She remained silent.  
‚ÄòAre you a vegetarian?‚Äô She shook her head.

Venerable studied her. If he did not give her some good scolding, surely she would not change. So he hardened his voice,  
‚ÄòIf I were to let you see yourself in the mirror, I think you will faint.‚Äô He continued, ‚ÄòAnd you shut yourself in this room, you do not even smell the stink of the room. Those who enter will surely be intolerable to this stench and yet you think you are still very fine. You are too stuck up.‚Äô

She kept quiet.

‚ÄòJust look at yourself, Amitabha came three times as He does not despise your smell, your age and the terrible conditions. You think you are so great? Refusing the invitation of such an Honourable Buddha?‚Äô

He raised his voice in anger, ‚ÄòNext time, when He comes again, will you go?‚ÄôShe looked up at the Master and slowly nodded her head.

‚ÄòYou are so fortunate to have three filial sons who take good care of you. They do not leave you when you are in this terrible condition. They only want to help you especially your eldest son who have asked you to change your diet. Tomorrow onwards will you take only vegetables?‚Äô he asked.

She nodded again.

And after that the Master left. He predicted the old lady would leave within a week. She passed away on the third day.

The eldest son requested three wishes from the Buddha, which he himself felt that he had been asking too much also. Yet the Buddha granted his wishes.

He said to the Buddha, ‚ÄòMy family is situated in this deep mountain. Most of the people here do not have faith in the Buddha. And I am the only one who has faith in the Buddha. Even my brothers do not believe. Please let my mother be free from the terrible stench. If she is so smelly, I think no one in the village will come to the funeral.

Secondly, let her body be kept in a stable condition and does not deteriorate.

Thirdly, I pleaded the Buddha to show me a real response that my mother is born in the Pure Land.‚Äô

During the funeral, he was surprised that the smell was gone. He took a good look at his mother‚Äôs face and found that it was as though wrapped with a thin layer of preservative film. He really felt the kindness of the Buddha. The impossible requests were answered. And the two brothers who were forced to recite the Buddha Name now truly felt the responses and their faith increased after seeing the inconceivable butterfly, the transformation body of their beloved mother.",Buddhism,1705593152.0,t3_199t8ai,1.0,3
Difficulties finding a Sangha,"The closet one to my house is called True Buddha sangha, and it follows some dude who claims to be the next buddha and was the lotus boy in another life or something?!  It sounded very sus and upon researching appears to be a cult. It's very hard to find a good sangha even though there are many in my area. I have reached out to a number of Vietnamese and Thai based sanghas/temples, but with no response, I assume they are not open to westerners nor have any english speaking monks/services. The ones that do have english that are near me are Theravada, Won Buddhism, White Plum Zen, and Plum Village. I wanted to take my teen with me to the smaller Plum Village sangha I had been attending for the last year, but its very small and just for adults at this time. The Theravada sangha was very welcoming of having myself and teen attend, but their weekly in person sangha is sunday 5-7pm in the middle of family dinner time, so sadly that ruled itself out. The Won Buddhist sangha was open to my teen coming with me, but I've read a lot of criticism that its not really Buddhism and I've read how its a blend of several things that were local to Korea when it came about. Has anyone been to a Won Buddhist sangha?? The Zen sangha is all older folks from what I could see and is the farthest away.  The Theravada sangha has a few monks from Sri Lanka, which is cool. The Won is run by a Korean priest, and the others run by older westerners.

Anguttara Nikaya 3.100 (Lump of Salt) preach Survival of the Fittest over Morality?,"So the Text say something like -A minister or ruler doesn't carry karma to next life. But a poor person does it.

How Law of Karma work?

First Mental Power, other powers and Morality as Secondary?

This kinda look interesting and realistic to me btw. I think morality is important but secondary from my personal view compared to Power.

Karma is created by thoughts and Intention and feelings. So long lasting negative feelings will create bad karma.

I read somewhere that Victims get More karma than Oppressor. How accurate is that?

Btw, does non-trivial and serious offences count to Karma for stronger people?

Edit:- By strong, I meant someone with a developed mind by overcoming impulses. Self made rich people are having greater pulse control like Ambani who was a mere petrol pump employee.

Question about the BƒÅhiya Sutta relating towards a recent personal discovery,"I've recently discovered that when I stop focusing my eyes on specific things and get into a sort of panoramic view that suddenly noises that triggered strong emotional reactions like loud door banging don't trigger anything. I hear the sound but there is no emotional response like fear or anger. I just hear the sound. It's like a binary on/off switch. I don't know what's happening and the only thing that comes to my mind is this quote:

>Then, BƒÅhiya, you should train yourself thus: In reference to the seen,  there will be only the seen. In reference to the heard, only the heard.  In reference to the sensed, only the sensed. In reference to the  cognized, only the cognized. That is how you should train yourself. When  for you there will be only the seen in reference to the seen, only the  heard in reference to the heard, only the sensed in reference to the  sensed, only the cognized in reference to the cognized, then, BƒÅhiya,  there is no you in connection with that. When there is no you in  connection with that, there is no you there. When there is no you there,  you are neither here nor yonder nor between the two. This, just this,  is the end of stress.

A new understanding of Dhukka made me re-evaluate my life,"I used to meditate twice a day religiously.  I felt much more at peace in the world and with the way things were.  Several kids and jobs later...I perceive life as more stressful.  I consider myself successful.  I have everything a person could ever want.  A great family, job, home, friends, money, health, etc., but something always seems off.  The simplest way I can put it is that it (it being life itself) is never quite good enough.  In my mind, I cannot be content with it.  I want to 'make it better' in a variety of ways or seek to improve on every aspect of my life no matter how good it already is which removes the enjoyment of it.

This is where dhukka comes in for me.  I always associated dhukka with the classic ""life is suffering"" which read on the service just sounds like life is one series of subsequent miserable events.  I delved a little deeper into the word and found a definition more like 'something is always slightly off' or a 'pebble in your shoe' or a 'squeaky wheel.'  I appreciate these definitions more because that is what I feel in my own life.  I crave improvement everywhere which I *think* leads to this sense of something is always off.  

I am a driven and motivated person, but I have not paid much attention to my mental health over the past several years.  I want to change that, but I don't know how to reconcile this concept of dhukka with still being a driven and motivated person.  Buddhism talks a lot about alleviating our desires or removing cravings, but how can we do that without giving up on goals, dreams, pursuits of improvement etc.?  Is it possible to remove craving from our lives, enjoy what is, but still have goals and aspirations?

What does karma look / act like?,"For example; let‚Äôs say there is a person who abused and SAd an old close friend; and eventually giving them heroin to try, which quickly killed them.

"Does it make sense to talk about ""breaking the cycle of Samsara""?","On first glance, this seems like a sensible formulation; ""breaking the cycle"" is a familiar formulation to anglophones, and we want to prevent the cycle from cycling, so ""breaking"" it seems to be the applicable word here.

But I'm not sure if there are philosophical/symbolic implications here that I'm not considering. The dharmic wheel is a frequent motif in Buddhist (and Hindu and Jain) art, and used as a symbol of Buddhism, and it is never shown broken, but rather as if it was something worth of respect and reverence in its complete and unbroken wholeness, even if individuals want to get off it.

"My goal is less anger, but Buddhism/meditation just make me far angrier","I am running out of options for my anger, especially now that I am concluding buddhism and meditation are not a solution by any means.

I don‚Äôt understand how I‚Äôm supposed to love everyone else who‚Äôs done me wrong, supposed to not find anything wrong with the people who‚Äôve caused my lifelong anger, and who contribute to it.

"DN 30: A sutta explaining 32 good deeds you can do, plus rewards.","https://suttafriends.org/sutta/dn30/
https://suttacentral.net/dn30/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin

Thus sutta contains information about the rewards of being truthful, helpful, compassionate, and so on by body speech and mind. If you want a good list of various wholesome qualities to develop in the practice, try this sutta out.
-
Rebirth wise, what I find particularly interesting about this sutta is that it seems to suggest that a heavenly birth through good deeds is beneficial even after you come back from heaven. You get another shot at human life/dhamma practice by doing this and get a physical body part corresponding with the achievement.

I'd admit, though, that it's rare to see some of these parts on people, like 40 teeth or long hands. Nevertheless, I would hazard to say that aiming for a good heavenly birth and nothing more doesn't mean you doom yourself to some complete random samsara rebirth lottery, but that the accumulation of merit predisposes you to a better human birth.

Ajahn Punnadhammo (great teacher btw) said in a livestream that there usually aren't extreme ""samsara rebirth"" swings, ie if you did good now you're most likely to get a good rebirth, and if you have a good birth now it was probably because of a good birth before. There are probably a few canonical exceptions, but yeah.

Sensory issues and controlling anger,"So I'm autistic and my sensory issues are pretty bad at the minute, any annoying noise can really stress me out and especially when people do it more on purpose it can send me over the edge. How do I not get angry when I cannot deal with the noise? Many people have suggested ear plugs, headphones etc, but in my very strict school, I can't get away with anything. The only chance I've got is religious studies lessons on Mondays and Tuesdays when the particular trigger (my friend) sits next to me, and the teacher is understanding enough to let me take a moment outside. But at lunchtime, I cannot escape the noise, especially from her. I can already hear a million noises from the projector, the clock, others making general noises etc, they make it hard to focus, but I can deal with them. It's when my friend clicks her pen or taps the table, that adds to the noise and I get very angry, on Monday I flipped and snatched the pen out of her hand which hurt her, and I felt so bad about it. How do I keep calm in that situation? I feel like I lose control when it happens, and I find it almost impossible to just deal with it, and I lash out. I want to have metta and be a calm and kind person, but I don't know what to do to be like this, because I can try hard, but I'll lose it. Like on Monday, I did actually try very hard to cope with it, I asked her very politely if she could stop clicking, she tried her luck and did it one last time, and I lost control and snatched it.

"‚ÄúThe harder we struggle to establish ourselves and our relationships, the more painful our experience becomes‚Äù.","This excerpt from buddhanet.net is intriguing. It got me thinking‚Ä¶ we are constantly defining ourselves based on who we want to be and who we think we are. We assign narratives to ourselves based on our likes and dislikes. 

Same for others, we spend so much of our waking time thinking about others. What they wore, what they said, how they said it, and on and on. We think about what others think about us. 

Many people want the best things, they want the best houses, a perfect family, and a clean image. When those ideals are not achieved, it leads to discontentment. 

I think about my own relationships and expectations of others and see a lot of the reasons for my own struggles in life. I see these same struggles normalized in the people I‚Äôm around, like a sickness that you get used to feeling. 

When I think about suffering as an illness, it really starts to make sense to me and gives me compassion - There is a cure, but most people just get used to feeling ill and have forgotten there are medicines that can treat the illness.",Buddhism,1705544649.0,t3_199f1uz,1.0,6

I'm not sure what should be the right path to be more compassionate to myself,"I hope I won't turn this into a very long post, so I'll try to give some context first where I'm coming from. I have mild generalized and social anxiety which over the years of self-reflection, therapies and a ton of help from buddhist teachings I've come to understand better and I'm at a point where I feel I'm beginning to accept it in a more compassionate way. I'm not expecting to get rid of it overnight or even at all, as I used to before, and I don't hate myself anymore for having this condition.

However, it definitely still affects me, and especially at work it causes me a lot of stress. I'm very aware that this stress is founded on false and unnecessary beliefs, but it is also a fact that this knowledge by itself won't make it go away, and it makes me sad to see how it affects my physical and mental health. So even though I can cope with it better, I still keep wondering if it wouldn't be better for me to change my career expectations and find more suitable jobs for me with less prestige perhaps but something that would allow me be more at peace with myself and my relationships to others.

But here's where my dilemma comes in, because I also wonder if it's perhaps just my anxiety trying to make me avoid challenges and difficult things that might be actually be good for me. This wouldn't be anything new, of course, and I feel a big part of my life has been a constant push-back against what my anxiety tells me to do and what I think it's worth doing. On the other hand, I have also changed my mind or rather realized what I truly think it's worth doing and having. I'm an engineer by training and for most of my career I didn't even see any other choice rather than keep climbing the ladder to work in big companies and reach the highest positions. But perhaps too late I had to be honest to myself and realize that I don't like those positions. I think I always knew but somehow I didn't even consider it an option not to do that because anything else would be failure.

 I already did quite a change, and I'm now working in the healthcare field towards a doctorate, so I'm pretty far from profit driven motivations, but I'm perhaps even deeper in a place with high prestige, high-stake projects and full of extremely smart and competitive people. So in a way it's very encouraging, positive challenges and it's great to be able to contribute and have nice impact from my job, but it brings me suffering through the stress and anxiety. I keep going back and forth if it's just my fears making me doubt if all these positive things are actually worth it, or if it wouldn't be the better choice for myself to let go of the need to be involved with this ""big"", ""important"" jobs. I think I genuinely believe it's not worth it, but again, what if this is just a trap from my mind to keep me in a comfort zone? and what if I end up with the same stress and anxiety in any other type of job? 

I'm pretty lost how to approach this, how to know which of the inner voices are the most genuine ones, because I can see how many of the things I thought I wanted are just what society told me to want but not what I really care about. I hope I managed to express myself clearly. Any light on dealing with this would be very appreciated!",Buddhism,1705512715.0,t3_1992bje,0.81,6

How to deal with a toxic friend (wisdom and advice request),"Hi friends

I have someone who I would perhaps consider my best friend but he's really toxic to me lately.

There are points in time where he treats me nice but he also treats me badly for some reason which I am not so sure of.

I've bonded a lot with him and confided in him a lot but recently, we've gone through a period of on-and-off relationship. He get's mad at me for little reason and he said something about not liking gay people or something like that when I asked him about the toxicity yesterday. We made up the very same day and now, I'm back to him being mean to me. Yesterday, he told me over text to fuck off and to go kill myself.

It's tough because I am not saying I'm perfect- but to my knowledge, I didn't do anything wrong to the point of deserving this treatment.

I've already communicated extensively how the things he's doing cross my boundaries/line, verbalising my feelings to him. But he doesn't seem to care much or at all.

But the thing is, I'm kinda lonely in school. Yes, I have many ""friends"", or maybe just ""aquaintances"", but he's the only guy I'm actually really close to. He's always been the more dominant one in our friendship but that just doesn't give him the right to treat me like this. I texted him today, apologising for putting so much blame on him (even though I don't remember doing that) and asked if we could promise to be nice to each other in the future. I asked him to explain to me why he is or was mad at me, saying that if he doesn't tell me, I can't change anything. And he ignores all the three messages.

I know that some folks would say in the comments that this is a result of attatchment or something like that but aren't humans social creatures? for a period of time and though this is lesser the case anymore, he was willing to befriend the kid that no one wanted to befriend.

I need a way to alleviate my suffering. How to proceed? If we make up again, do I go back to him? Do I try to be friends with him again?

Assuming we don't make up, how do I alleviate my suffering?

The past few days feels so long.

I just want love and friends and peace and happiness and truth be told, I'm not okay with being detatched from sociality, from being ""okay with being alone""

A multiplicity of past lives?,"Hi all, wanted to check your intuition on past lives.

I resonate with the idea of anatman, and that we are absent of inherent, intrinsic nature, and that we are are an ever changing momentary confluence of conditions and relationships. I resonate with karma as volitional action, and cause and effect. 

Where I am a bit less clear is the idea of mindstreams. (Also, do people have good sutta references for this?) As I picture things, if I go ‚Äúupstream‚Äù into past lives, it seems very natural to picture a ‚Äúforking‚Äù into many streams, ie a multiplicity of multiple past lives at any point in time. Similarly, as I go down stream I also don‚Äôt see why a mind stream necessarily needs to stay singular, and not fork into multiple streams later on, just as causes can lead to multiple effects, all intermingling... And I suppose parinirvana is the mindstream dissipating altogether?

To clarify, I‚Äôm not against past lives or rebirth. Rather, it‚Äôs not obvious to me why or why not past lives and future lives should be singular, the way I usually hear people talk about it (and also becomes much easier to confuse with reincarnation, which we all know rebirth is not).

Does a Buddhist have to be an absolute pacifist?,"I‚Äôve been getting into Buddhist philosophy over the past few months, I‚Äôve been practicing meditation and reading The Heart of The Buddha‚Äôs Teaching by Thich Nhat Hanh, etc. But I‚Äôve been wondering whether I can truly commit to this philosophy if I‚Äôm not an absolute pacifist, something I don‚Äôt believe I could ever be. Obviously, violence should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. Even if you‚Äôre being attacked, you should try to retreat to safety if you can, but sometimes you have to use violence to defend yourself, even if it involves lethal force. Most pacifists concede this, I think.

But even more broadly, I‚Äôm ideologically a communist, and so I believe that armed struggle to overthrow the capitalist order which routinely impoverishes and kills people, is a form of self defense. Same with armed struggle by colonized people to achieve liberation. So, I don‚Äôt know how to reconcile these two things. Non violence is a worthwhile personal philosophy I think, but I‚Äôve always avoided violence anyway. But if I decide that armed struggle is always wrong, well then I‚Äôd essentially be abandoning my ideology.

What's your take on this? And honestly, if we're not even sure we can reach or keep enlightenment, what keeps you motivated to follow the Buddhist path? Really curious to hear different opinions on this. Thanks!",Buddhism,1705429062.0,t3_1989pht,0.86,10
Namo Buddhaya all ‚ù§Ô∏è,"Lately, I have increased my efforts in following a more Buddhist-driven ethical life: practicing generosity (dana) and trying to give out boundless compassion, eliminating meat and other animal derived things from my diet (I know this is not necessarily promoted by the Buddha, but it‚Äôs a personal belief of mine that FOR ME eating meat in my country makes the first precept hard to observe‚Äîno judgment AT ALL on those who disagree or cannot eat this way, it‚Äôs like my 4th day anyways). I have also started observing 4 Uposatha days a month (again starting about a month ago) during the full moon, new moon, & quarter moons, and the reason I am bringing this up is because, as I am getting further into the path I have so many more questions and am kindly requesting information for a teacher as well as sangha; both can be virtual

Help me understand rebirth,"Hey guys,I'm struggling with the Buddhist concept of reincarnation. Please let me know if my understanding of it, which is as follows, is correct:

1. As there is no individual soul, no individual identity (or soul) transmigrates after death
2. What is subject to reincarnation is the karmic effect. Our deeds, good, and and neutral, shape and influence the karmic ""load"" or ""mass"" around us
3. This karmic baggage stops changing but lives on after our death, as the chain of causes and effects that we had put in motion before we pass, will still influence lives of other living beings, living and about to be born. Is that correct?
4. However, it seems like the actual, traditional teaching on rebirth is different, and it points out that rebirth is both individual and its centre is consciousness. What is meant by that is that rebirth is not diluted in other lives ( as I described in point 2.) but whatever is passed on, passes to a singular new being in its entirety. And what is reincarnated is not just karmic influence, but actual consciousness. Thus, in rare instances, some beings are able to connect with their previous incarnations.I find it hard to reconcile such approach to this concept with my rational mind. Is my interpretation of rebirth ((non-traditional, I reckon) acceptable and fund in some school o Buddhist thought?

I realize that this part of the doctrine is difficult, so could you point me to some good reading that tackles the subject?",Buddhism,1705451346.0,t3_198itxl,0.71,3
Realisation that only this Now moment exists.,"So I had something click as I was riding the subway yesterday, I had not slept that night lol.  


  
But as I was riding seeing some people on their phones, some talking and people moving, it kinda occured to me that there might be no free will.  


  
Not that there is no 'free will' but rather that there is no doer and there was a natural flow that moved things, things happen spontenaously without any one's control.  


  
One for example cannot control when a thought arises to do something or think about something, it just happens.

  
So what I realised is that I do not basically control what is happening, but not just that,  


  
I also realised that I always try to grasp at things, I try to not lose the past, memories or ideas that I identify with yet I also jump into the future.  


  
And the reason was this constant struggle to maintain an identity and a continuity in this world.  


  
As I moved with these ideas, another idea struck me, how do I know the past exists?  


  
Yes, I have memories but even these are fleeting and fade.  


  
As I thought about this, It struck me that everything is impermanent.  


  
Even if you experienced the most amazing day possible, that day will fade and when it fades, it's as if it never existed.  


  
Things pass and time washes way all experiences but I was always trying to grasp things in this flow of experiences, which is impossible since experiences always change and move.  


  
I realised all these things, these happenings are impermanent.  


  
But its then that I was struck by another idea, All these experiences Move and Change But the Present moment is always there, its always Here.  


  
That in which these impermanent experiences arise is permanent.  


  
This Now moment is always here and its always the same, things appear and disappear but its always in this very moment

  
I realised that if I wanted contentment and peace, instead of grasping experiences, I should try to grasp this Now moment and try to be with it.  


  
I also thought what if this now moment was before the world?

  
Meaning the world itself appears in this Now moment and this Now moment is the Dao itself  (I don't know the name that buddhists use)  


  
As I was thinking it also occured to me that there might be no ""me""  


  
These streams of thought I call 'me' is not for 'me' to own, it arises and moves spontenaously  


  
In summary, I realised this Now moment is where all experience appears and is what should be grasped to be free of experiences or to have the permanence that experiences don't have.  


  
Which is funny because this Now moment cannot be grasped yet it cannot be lost either, you are always in it.

Consumerism,"As a beginner, I've been using my research to create a list of buddhist inspired ways to live a better and more connected life. We're not monks and so I am often confused on how to apply the teachings in a modern world where we engage a lot more.

The first one is: 

""In a consumer-driven society, people often find identity and happiness in material possessions. We should practice mindful consumption. Understand that possessions are temporary and derive true happiness from experiences and relationships rather than material goods.""

This also encompasses trying to live a minimalistic life, but also not denying myself of things that can benefit me. I am just struggling where to draw the line. 

For example, exercise equipment lasts a lifetime. A few articles of clothing or a nice haircut isn't the end of the world if not in excess. Taking pride in our appearance is natural. I also don't think purchasing video game consoles, etc, is anti-mindful if you understand impermanence, balance and moderation, and are still taking the time to self-reflect, meditate, and be present.

I recycle old wax to make candles. I am mindful how my diet affects the environment. I don't splurge or over-indulge where I can help it. I'm always looking to be mindful with my purchases but don't vilify small pleasures.

The meditator who becomes Amitabha Reciter,"
The meditator who becomes Amitabha Reciter

The meditator who becomes Amitabha Reciter
Reciting Namo Amitabha Buddha, he was cured and entered the Pure Land Door

Âøµ‰ΩõÁóÖÁôí  ÂÖ•ÂáÄÂúüÈó®

Dharma Master Di Yi is a monk in the Xiang Ji Monastery in Changan, Shanxi. He is about seventy years old. In 1999, he was down with Oesophageal Cancer. The hospital notified him of his acute illness. After going back to the temple, he could not even come down from his bed, with his body all swollen. He could not breathe properly and groaned the whole day. Moreover, his blood vessels are hardened and there is no way to give him Analgesic injection. He suffered greatly. Master Di Yi felt that he could no longer be saved. So, he gave away all his money to the permanent dwelling. He asked them to conduct two sessions of prayers to relieve the sufferings of the hungry ghosts and to cross over his love ones, enemies and creditors after his death. He sought them to transfer merits to him so that he would not fall into the hungry ghost path. Master Di Yi had been practising meditation all the while. He seldom talked to people as he spent most of his time sitting in meditation. He had no faith in the Pure Land Sect. Even at the hour when he was facing death, he did not even seek to attain a rebirth by reciting the Buddha‚Äôs Name. Instead, he sought to die faster. Master Chang Zheng advised him to recite Namo Amitabha Buddha. He said, ‚ÄòOh! It is my fault that I did not put in effort in my cultivation. Now, I have no control over my births and deaths. What is the use to call out to Namo Amitabha Buddha? I do not think it will work‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äô



After further exhortation by Master Chang Zheng, Master Di Yi started to recite the Buddha‚Äôs Name once in a while. Chang Zheng Shi moved to his room to take care of him throughout the day and night, feeding him food and water, washing him up. Chang Zheng Shi took care of his pooping and peeing with no complaints at all. Most important of all, he always recite Namo Amitabha Buddha with him, encouraging him to give himself up to Amitabha Buddha. Di Yi Master moaned and recited, ‚ÄòAi yo! Amitabha Buddha. It is real suffering! Why am I still alive? If I am not a monk, I would have committed suicide. Amitabha Buddha, do come quickly. I have enough of this pain. Aiyo, aiyo, Amitabha Buddha, please let me die!‚Äô‚Ä¶

Three months passed by and Master Di Yi was getting better. He was cured of his illness and the swelling subsided.  From then onward, he renounced the zen meditation and continued to practise the Pure Land Dharma, reciting Namo Amitabha Buddha exclusively. Besides, he also exhorted others to recite Namo Amitabha Buddha exclusively, to bring forth the mind to seek a rebirth. Very often he would say this, ‚ÄòNo more meditation, no more   Sutras learning. I truly want to recite Namo Amitabha Buddha only‚Ä¶.‚Äô (recorded by Master Jing Hong,23rd August, 2001)

A comment:

Amitabha recitation is foremost in merits and virtues as it is the full merits and virtues which is accomplished by the Buddha for the sake of rescuing all living beings. If we only want to cultivate our merits and virtues, very often our good roots are with leakage. When can we truly accomplish the full merits and virtues? We mundane men are very arrogant and boastful as we do not want to rely on the Buddha. That is why we suffer acutely. Most grateful to Namo Amitabha Buddha",Buddhism,1705434962.0,t3_198c6dy,0.7,4

"Buddhism claims to have exclusive truth in terms of the ""right"" path to God. What makes Buddhism's truth claims any different or better than other religions that make similar claims?","First, I come as a seeker, not as someone who is trying to tear down. Having spent 30 years of my life in a high-demand religion that claimed to be ""the only true church"" I am extremely wary of exclusive truth claims.

In my short study of Buddhism, I find the claims and argumentation in support of Buddhism being the only true path to ""god"" using the same basic structure as any other religion, namely that truth is experiential, etc. and so if you as if it is improving your life and bringing you close to god, it must be true. I find this type of argumentation lacking, though, as truth in this sense seems to be subjective and yet I also don't know that even when I study science I find objective truth.

That leads me to the conclusion that Buddhism is no better but also no worse than any other religious system in terms of arriving at truth. I'm sure there are those here who would disagree, so I would love to hear different perspectives on my observations.

I thank you in advance for your consideration of my question.

Being subjected to extortion/coercion,"Hey, I'm wondering how I should skillfully react in this situation. 

I have a rare severe hearing hypersensitivity that leads to prolonged pain and severe stress when being exposed to daily noise (like shouting, banging, dog barking, etc.). It also worsens permanently with too much exposure. This unfortunately forced me to isolate myself from society as most situations outside my home can become dangerously loud for me. It also results in specific requirements for living in an appartment (it must be super quiet). 

Now the rent of my appartment has been cancelled and the date where I have to leave the appartment is the end of February 2024. In my country you have the right to ask the court for an extension of your rent which can be up to 4 years. The chance that I get 2 years or more is high as besides my illness there is also a severe shortage of appartments around where I live. I have already filed the documents to the court including a very detailed explanation of my illness, the date for the preceeding attempt at conciliation will be on February 8th. 

My landlord (new one since December) wants to renovate the whole house and doesn't want to wait for 2 years or more, so he told me in a letter that he would start with renovating parts of the house at the beginning of February, unless I waive my right for extension, in which case he would grant me an extension until the end of March 2024 and delay the renovation until I'm out. It is impossible for me to stay in the house during the time it is being renovated due to my hypersensitivity, so I would be forced to stay somewhere else from 6:30 in the morning to about 18:00 in the evening during weekdays (I don't work at the moment). This is very difficult as I could stay more or less nowhere without risking a worsening of my state. Finding an appropriate appartment until the end of March 2024 on the other hand is also next to impossible. 

I am very fortunate that my parents offered up to allow me to stay at their home for a while (which is subpar and stressful for us all though since I need a lot of accomodation when being around others). At the same time I am furious at the behaviour of my new landlord as he is essentially ok sending me to my doom (either too much noise, or having nowhere to go / being homeless). If my health weren't so fragile and susceptible to potential retaliation I would have him prosecuted for coercion. So I'm left with the unpleasant option of just agreeing to his proposal and not fight at all. It makes me feel bitter.

Does anyone have some thoughts what kind of attitude could help here or any other advice? Thanks for reading my venting, it's a tough pill to swallow.

"If there is no self that exists separate from experience, then why is the cessation of dukkha desirable ?","I am new to buddism. So new, that I don‚Äôt know that it would be truthful to call myself a bhuddist, though I would like to be. 

As I have been studying, this question has been bothering me and I have yet to find an answer to it: I believe I understand the idea that there is no self beyond your experience. Change and volition are required for life, and so that change and volition require that life continues, so, rebirth. In rebirth, it is no aspect of the self that is reborn, but a simple continuation of the change and volition that continues into the next life. We are not the same person in our next life, just like are not the same person from one moment to the next. It is just the continuation of a pattern. 

Dukkha is caused by thirst, and in finding truth and liberating ourselves of this thirst, we can achieve nirvana and the cessation of dukkha. What I don‚Äôt understand is why this is a good thing to work torwards ?

 If there is no self, and acheiving truth liberates us from dukkha, then surely any aspirations for truth are also aspirations for a final death of sorts, a desire to end this life and not continue into the next one. If the cycle of rebirth ends for you, and there is no self beyond the experiences we have in life, then is the choice to discover nirvana not just a peaceful suicide of sorts ?

"Hope, fear, death, loneliness, community and children.","Firstly, I have a lot of questions please don‚Äôt feel like you need to address them all.

I been reading Buddhist writings on fear I have tried to discuss the topic with a few people although it seems as stigmatised as death and loneliness. It seems to me that fear can be described as aversion to suffering as hope can be defined as grasping for happiness. I have been contemplating the eight worldly concerns and I am yet to find an example of my behaviour that is not motived one of them. I don‚Äôt believe that people can become so indifferent that they do things with no motivation at all. I have widened my understanding of what fear is and I think I am out of step with society, I think society‚Äôs view of fear is a bit extreme. There are tee-shirts and stickers branded ‚ÄòNo Fear‚Äô that are popular with young men, that now seem ridiculous to me. Just because you‚Äôre a base jumper doesn‚Äôt mean you have ‚Äòno fear‚Äô it just means you are brave when faced with intense fear or perhaps you underestimate the risk and are grasping on to the pleasure that excitement brings either way if they had ‚ÄòNo Fear‚Äô they wouldn‚Äôt need a parachute.

Is my understanding correct in that fear motivates nearly half of what people do?

I have read that fear of death is our largest fear and motivates much of our behaviour. I‚Äôm usure and would like comment, but perhaps fear often isn‚Äôt intense, people do mundane things like eating because on some level they hope for good health and fear death? 

Without fear of death humans would not exist is it just that we choose to ignore it because it‚Äôs to confronting? We use words like anxiety instead of experiencing intense fear, it‚Äôs called the fight or flight response, response to what other than fear?

Loneliness is defined as sadness because one has no friends or company. But isn‚Äôt the suffering of loneliness caused by fear. As babies we were dependent on others, we a drawn to stable partnerships to raise children, as tribes we survived as communities. Is loneliness a primal fear as fundamental as fear of death and required for our survival?

I have also heard that you cannot have hope without fear or fear without hope and that makes them two aspects of the same thing, is this understanding correct from the Buddhist viewpoint? Can you provide an example of having one without the other?

From a Buddhist point of view are all fears a result of our root fear of our or others in our community dying that is, fear of death? Does it make sense that the eight worldly concerns exist to help motivate us to thrive and survive in a community and reproduce? Finally, is it our true root hope that us and our community thrive and survive across generations?    ",Buddhism,1705376401.0,t3_197sz9p,0.67,1
Two questions about rebirth,"
If animals eventually ,,burn off‚Äù the unwholesome karma and are able to get better/higher rebirths, how come humans can‚Äôt burn off the unwholesome karma and ,,float up‚Äù this way as well? 

Is ,,burning off‚Äù unwholesome karma the only way an animal can get better rebirth or can it somehow achieve at least more tolerable rebirth by doing something (from which it would be easier to move forward to eventually becoming a human and eventually reaching enlightenment)?

Pieces that deal with non-grasping at consciousness itself or non-grasping after death?,"From reading Nagarjuna and many, many, many other pieces, I've sensed a theme that the Buddha almost wishes that we all could each reject the notion of grasping at life itself--the will to want to live again and experience all the sensations of life again--as the critical grasping which continues to turn the Wheel of Time and, without releasing this, we will never know the true freedom of suffering.

Dialogue with Manjushri. Exerpt from the Vimalakirti Sutra.,"*This is a abridged and paraphrased excerpt from Vimalakirti Sutra that I wrote for personal study based on the version Translated by Burton Watson, and thought of sharing:*

„Éª Manjushri asked Vimalakirti: ""How should a Bodhisattva go about comforting and instructing another Bodhisattva who is ill?""

Vimalakirti responded: ""Guide him to understand the impermanence of the body, without encouraging him to despise or reject it. Enlighten him about the sufferings that the body may endure, but discourage him from seeking death as a solution. Teach him that the body is devoid of ego, yet inspire him to guide and support sentient beings. Share with him the concept of the body's emptiness, but refrain from discussing its ultimate extinction. Encourage him to reflect on past wrongdoings, but avoid dwelling on them. Instead, motivate him to utilize his own illness as a means to empathize with the suffering of others, recognizing the countless kalpas of their past struggles, and contemplate how he can bring benefit to all living beings. Remind him of the merit he has attained through religious practice, emphasizing the importance of leading a pure life and resisting feelings of worry or gloom. Encourage him to cultivate unwavering diligence, aspiring to become a master healer who can alleviate the ailments of the community. This is the approach a Bodhisattva should adopt when comforting and guiding a fellow Bodhisattva who is unwell, aiming to bring happiness to his heart.

This ailing Bodhisattva of ours despite being free from the sensations of pain and pleasure, willingly allows himself to experience them. Even though he has not fully attained enlightenment, he does not seek to eliminate these sensations within himself. Instead, when he feels pain in his own body, he directs his thoughts towards the suffering beings in the lower realms, and cultivates a profound sense of compassion. He tells himself, ""I have disciplined and controlled myself, and now I must guide and support other living beings!"" But he should simply rid them of their illnesses and not deprive them of anything, merely teaching and guiding them so they can cut off the source of illness.

What is meant by the source of illness? It means having troublesome entanglements. These entanglements are the very source of our suffering. And how do we let go of them? By realizing that there is nothing to cling to. When we stop grasping at things, we free ourselves from these troublesome entanglements. And what does it mean to realize that there is nothing to grasp at? It means to transcend dualistic views. Dualistic views arise when we perceive things as either internal or external. Let go of such views, and you will no longer cling to anything.

‚ÄúThough he moves in the threefold world, he does no injury to the Dharma-nature ‚Äî such is the practice of the bodhisattva. Even in the formless realm, he tirelessly works towards the salvation of countless living beings. In the realm of nonaction, he manifests himself in physical form to aid others. Though he avoids being consumed by passion, he ignites within himself the unwavering determination to perform virtuous deeds. Even though he engages in meditation, liberation, and deep concentration, he does not seek rebirth as a result of these practices. This is the way of the bodhisattva.

„Éª Manjushri inquired of Vimalakirti: ""How does the bodhisattva perceive living beings?"" Vimalakirti responded: Just as the wise perceive the reflection of the moon in water, or a face and form seen in a mirror; as the shimmering heat in a scorching season, or the echo that follows a cry,  like bubbles on the water  As shapes in the formless world, as remnants of earthly desires in a Buddha, as visions seen by a blind person,  as images in a dream after awakening  ‚Äîthis is how the bodhisattva perceives living beings.""

""Manjushri questioned: ""If the bodhisattva perceives beings in this manner, how can he show them compassion?""

‚ÄúHe shows them a compassion of serene extinction, as it leads to no rebirth; shows them a compassion that does not burn, as it is free from earthly desires; shows them a compassion that is impartial, just as the three existences of past, present, and future are impartial;  shows them a compassion that is completely natural, understanding that it arises without cause; shows them a compassion of enlightenment, which has only one flavor; shows them a compassion without any distinction, as it eliminates all favoritism; shows them great pity and compassion/guides them with the Great Vehicle. He shows them a compassion that never loses hope, recognizing that everything is empty and devoid of ego  shows them a compassion of wisdom, which always knows the right time; shows them a compassion of skillful means, with manifestations suited to every occasion.""",Buddhism,1705309156.0,t3_1974cky,0.8,8

What if all I can muster is metta?,"**Background**: In many respects, I am close to being a Buddhist. What keeps me from fully embracing a practice is that I tend to obsess over metaphysics (nibbana, anatta, etc).

The more I identify as Buddhist, the more I start to get stressed and scrupulous (Good Buddhist syndrome). Ironic, or telling, I know.

**Issue**: Even when I give up trying to 'be' a Buddhist, I still feel incredibly drawn to metta. Metta has gotten me closest to a transcendent, spiritual state than anything before. I see the instant good every time I do metta meditation. That being said, I feel like I don't have the right to practice it because I don't have the intention to take it further than that. I don't want nibbana right now (or ever maybe). Is metta something I can practice even if I don't want the ultimate goal of Buddhism?

I don‚Äôt think I can attend practice or delve into Buddhism much,"Tw// sexual assault 

Maybe the anti-dogma and less religious side of me side has won. Buddhism makes me feel incompetent and gives me self-doubt. I was raped recently. I‚Äôve been severely mentally ill for 15 years now. In and out of psych wards. I have a lot of ambition and want to help others in the world though. So hopefully I get there. I‚Äôm young I get it.

I‚Äôm decently smart and creative, painfully so. I‚Äôm definitely capable of having multiple existential crises at the same time. Review all the philosophies of the world at once.

I guess I can meditate everyday but I read online somewhere that if you‚Äôre severely mentally ill - it may not be the best choice. Meditation turns into a required practice, 1 turns into 2. Silence then calls for chants. And so on and so on. My therapist said there‚Äôs other forms of meditation like listening to music. Idk what kind of advice I want. Idk what I‚Äôd like to hear.

Questions about the four noble truths and the noble eightfold path,"The [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Noble_Truths) says that the term ""Four Noble Truths"" is derived from the pali word ‚ÄúcaturƒÅriyasaccƒÅni‚Äù which means ‚ÄúThe Truths of the Noble Ones‚Äù. Its not the Truths themselves that are Noble. It is the ‚ÄúNoble Ones‚Äù that accept these truths, or by definition ""those that show high moral principles and ideals"", that accept these Truths. 

So my first question is, if the Four Noble Truths have to do with suffering and the cessation of suffering, what does that have to do with being ""Noble""?  It doesn't seem like there is a need to associate being ""Noble"" with identifying the causes of suffering and the way to cease suffering.

&#x200B;

When I enter the Eightfold Path from the Fourth Noble Truth, at face value, it looks like its mostly a prescriptive guide for how to live a righteous or ""noble"" life and doesn't have anything to do with ending suffering through the cessation of clinging.

So my second question is, how does practicing the Eightfold Path lead to the cessation of clinging?

"Each sentient being is like a sleeping potential buddha who is dreaming about inherent existence of self and of all phenomena, and deludedly believing the dream to be true‚Ä¶","Each sentient being is like a sleeping potential buddha who is dreaming about inherent existence of self and of all phenomena, and deludedly believing the dream to be true, and therefore they are trapping themself in samsara - their uncontrollably recurring rebirth with all of its uncertainty, dissatisfaction, problems, and suffering.

The practice of buddhism for a sentient being, is like the method for them to wake up from this beginningless deluded dream, by waking up to the reality of emptiness.  In other words, waking up to the reality of the ‚Äúlack‚Äú of inherent existence of self and of all phenomena, in order to be blissfully free from samsara, and further, in order to become a fully awakened blissfully omniscient buddha for the benefit of all sentient beings who are still dreaming.

So remember, you are not creating the reality of emptiness, you just have to become awake to it. Emptiness has always, and will always be the deepest nature of self, and of all phenomena - quite literally, it is the deepest nature of everything!

What to do when the teacher giving the dharma talks seems... incompetent,"Im not saying they \*are\* incompetent, and I understand that, all things considered, if a person is credentialed and generally respected as a dharma teacher, they probably \*arent\* in an objective sense.

Theres this series of talks I have been meaning to get to, by a respected teacher, but when I listen to some of the examples she gives, I find myself rolling my eyes and grinding my teeth.

I get as far as, this is probably a me-problem, not a them-problem, inasmuch as they are a teacher who has studied for decades, and is known to know the subject (so they arent at fault) but when I listen to them I feel like they just have some problematic ways of looking at the material they are teaching (probably my brain putting that on them).

But what to actually do about that?

The problem is the talks series is long, like 40 x 90 minute talks. And I am at talk 2 and reaching for the off switch.

In regard to the situation, am I better off listening to this person who I find annoying, or am I better off moving to a different set of teachings that I can listen to with less... aversion?

Being Unbothered By Experiences: MN 152: The Development of the Faculties,"---

Excerpted from

**[MN 152: IndriyabhƒÅvanƒÅsutta: The Development of the Faculties](https://suttacentral.net/mn152/en/sujato)**

‚ÄúUttara, does PƒÅrƒÅsariya teach his disciples the development of the faculties?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe does, Master Gotama.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut how does he teach it?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaster Gotama, it‚Äôs when the eye sees no sight and the ear hears no sound. That‚Äôs how PƒÅrƒÅsariya teaches his disciples the development of the faculties.‚Äù 

...

Knowing this, the Buddha addressed Venerable ƒÄnanda, ‚ÄúƒÄnanda, the development of the faculties taught by PƒÅrƒÅsariya is quite different from the supreme development of the faculties in the training of the Noble One.‚Äù 

...

When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking come up in them. They understand: ‚ÄòLiking, disliking, and both liking and disliking have come up in me. That‚Äôs conditioned, coarse, and dependently originated. But this is peaceful and sublime, namely equanimity.‚Äô Then the liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking that came up in them cease, and equanimity becomes stabilized. It‚Äôs like how a person with clear eyes might open their eyes then shut them; or might shut their eyes then open them. Such is the speed, the swiftness, the ease with which any liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking at all that came up in them cease, and equanimity becomes stabilized.

"Midlife crisis, sexuality, and Zen","I've been dealing with a lot of loss recently, including financial struggles, death of a friend, marriage crisis, ageing parents, and officially entering midlife.

MahƒÅsthƒÅmaprƒÅpta Bodhisattva's practice of interpenetration through Buddha-contemplation (Nianfo),"The Chapter of Bodhisattva Dashizhi
(MahƒÅsthƒÅmaprƒÅpta)‚Äôs Perfect & Complete Realization of Nianfo SamƒÅdhi
(an extract from Chapter Five of the ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama S≈´tra)
„ÄäÂ§ßÂäøËá≥Ëè©Ëê®Âøµ‰ΩõÂúÜÈÄöÁ´†„Äã

Dharma Prince Dashizhi (Mahasthamaprapta), together with his group offifty-two Bodhisattvas, rose from his seat, prostrated himself with his head at the feet of the Buddha and declared: ‚ÄúI still remember that in the remotest of kalpas countless as the sands in the Ganges, there was a Buddha named Amitabha. In that kalpa, there were twelve TathƒÅgatas who succeeded each other respectively, the last of whom was named the
Buddha Whose Light Surpasses that of the Sun and Moon. That (Those)
Buddha(s) taught me Buddha-contemplation SamƒÅdhi.

For instance, if one concentrates his mind on someone else while the latter always forgets him, both may meet and see each other as if they don‚Äôt meet at all. However, if both are keen on thinking of each other, their keenness
will grow from one incarnation to another until they become inseparable like a body and its shadow.

The TathƒÅgatas in the ten directions have compassion for all living beings
and always think of them, like a mother who never ceases thinking of her
son. If the son runs away, her thoughts of him will not help. But if he also
thinks of her with the same keenness, they will not be separated in spite of
the passing transmigration.

If the hearts of living beings remember and think of the Buddha, they are
bound to behold Him in their present or future incarnations. They will not be far from the Buddha and thus without expedients, their hearts will naturally open.

They are like those whose bodies, perfumed by incense, give out fragrance,
hence the name Adorned by Fragrance and Light. From my fundamental
cause-ground, with the heart of mindfulness of AmitƒÅbha Buddha, I have
realized the dharma of non-arising (anutpattika-dharma-k·π£ƒÅnti).

Now I help all living beings of this world to return to the Pure Land through
being mindful of AmitƒÅbha Buddha. As the Buddha now asks about the best
means of perfection, I hold that nothing can surpass the perfect control of
the six senses with continuous pure thoughts (of AmitƒÅbha Buddha) in order
to realize Samadhi.‚Äù",Buddhism,1705179581.0,t3_195y1a4,0.86,10

What name to recite? Are there any differences between chanting/reciting Amitabha Buddha's (Amituofo) name and Avalokiteshvara's (Guan Yin) name?

Also to add, what are the major determinants in which Buddha's / Bodhisattva's name one should choose to chant/recite and how fast one can see results?

I was told it would be whichever one I could hold for the whole day if I was told to choose one. My issue with this is that I feel more connection with certain Buddhas/Bodhisattvas (subtly) even if I can hold another name longer/more often, so I wanted to ask for more thoughts on this on how I should pick.

I know I can choose more than one, but I'd rather focus on one (maybe two at most).

Also each name I recite sometimes gives different responses, as I know different mantras have different functions, or similarly how during a funeral we recite Amitabha's name and not say Medicine Master's. Same thing about Sutras each having different focuses I guess.

Is it offensive if I don't bow at the start of mediation sessions in this Buddhist hermitage?,"
I discovered a little Buddhist hermitage near where I live in England. They hold an open 1 hour meditation session led by monks which they advertise on their website. 
I am really interested in joining these meditation sessions. I have limited knowledge of Buddhism, but when I joined the first session I realised that they start and end the sessions with bowing in front of the Buddha statue/the monk and some chanting.

I am not comfortable with the idea of bowing, so I sat silently without bowing when they bowed. 

My question is, would my behaviour be offensive to the monks and other people present? 
I would really love to continue going to these sessions, but I know that I will not bowing, do you think this is something that is tolerated in settings like this or not? I wouldn't like to go if I will be causing offence or discomfort.

For context this is place is linked to traditions in north east Thailand from what I understood.

I know that I could probably ask them but there was no talking and the monks did not stay long before or after the meditation session, and it didn't feel like discussions with the monks was encouraged. Also, I don't know if I may get a polite answer while still causing offence by not bowing.

Thanks for your insights.


Edit: additional context: due to my religious upbringing I consider bowing the utmost expression of worshipping a deity. That's the only meaning it has in my mind. I know it is a lot more nuanced than this in Buddhism, but that's how it is set in my mind. I am still relatively observant of my religion, but I see genuine value in learning and practicing mindfulness meditation in Buddhist settings, but I don't want to  ""become Buddhist"".
So, in a way I am asking if this is a tolerated form of engaging with Buddhist thought, or is it pretty much you have to take the full context and practices.

Why is it more difficult to chant silently (with mind only)? Is this typical or just me or due to health issues?,"When I chant the Buddha's name or mantras silently (**not** moving my mouth or tongue) it makes my breath unnatural/forced as it wants to follow the pronunciations in my head. Is this normal?  


I know I have some breathing issues and just a weaker body in general but I'm not sure if this is also the norm for healthy or most people in general.  


It is easier when I chant silently with my mouth and tongue moving (called **Vajra recitation**), but because I end up inhaling some air through the mouth it also affects my breathing negatively since nasal breathing/and exhaling is ideal and healthiest to my knowledge.

  
Also because of my tight breathing/shortness of breath, I can't sustain long chanting (aloud), are there any tips on how I can improve my chanting/recitation practices?  
I would say Vajra recitation so far is the best for me in terms of not being short on breath, but chanting aloud is the easiest to hear my recitations clearly and distinctly which to my knowledge is what one should be doing when reciting the Buddha's name, or doing mantras (**please correct me if I am wrong**).

Old tattoos as a new Buddhist,"Hello all, just looking for some advice or support here. I have been practicing mindfulness and studying Buddhist teachings for a few years and my life has improved so much. My heart is so much more open and full with love and understanding, I feel better  and my relationships improve every day as I deepen my practice. My trouble is that before I began my practice I was using drugs and drinking heavily and have tattoos from that time period. All of them are dark in their imagery, a raven, a dagger, punk bands, etc. but one of them is a large inverted pentagram and this one is probably the one that I feel most uncomfortable with. I don‚Äôt like to wear shirts that expose my arms because I am embarrassed but the weather is warm where I live and when I do wear t shirts I feel so self conscious. Covering or removing them unfortunately is not an option because I do not have much money, any words of advice from a mindfulness standpoint would be much appreciated. I‚Äôm trying to achieve acceptance as it may not be possible for me to cover or remove them for a long time. Thank you.

"A question about ""AnattƒÅ"" and semantics.","In Buddhism, there is no permanent ""self"".No soul, no one substance to refer to when describing ""oneself"". We only have a set of factors, which together produce the illusion of ""self"".

This creates semantical difficulties when we want to discuss these topics clearly, leaving a lot of room for interpretation of what was actually said.The closest word I found to describe this set of factors, the concept of self is ""attƒÅ"" or ""attan"", but is there a one-word western alternative?

The reason I ask is I'm working on a game inspired by Buddhism.As you enter the game, you are welcomed by a creature (the creature is an illusion your mind produced).   
The first 2 phrases of the creature are:  
\- Hello! I've been waiting for you.  
\- You are new soul and I am going to help you on your journey.

I used the word ""soul"" as a placeholder for now and I'm looking for a proper alternative to describe the impermanent concept of ""self"" in a way, where both newcomers to buddhism won't say ""WTF you just said?"" and veteran buddhists won't be offended by the incorrect wording.Words like ""human"" won't be applicable, as the game explores different states (e.g. Antara-bhƒÅva).

How to Learn More About Theravada/Mahayana/Vajrayana? Do I Have To Choose?,"I'm very pleased by Buddhist teaching thus far, and even as an eclectic polytheist I realize its value above other traditions on the topic of inner pain. I'm severely disabled so I know the real value of such teachings. Just knowing that my pain is escapable through mindfullness is great, and the scientific, neurobiological benefits of meditation are really helping me. If there is any other practice that involves such a great act in Buddhism I'd love to know about it, whether Mahayana, Thravada, Vajrayana, or practices present in all sects.

 I think I learned that Siddhartha Gautama was (as far as I'm aware) a practicing Hindu, but merely had a more secular lense on the religion, rejected the caste system and had some ideas derived from Hinduism that make sense even today. I desperately want to know more, I don't want to be a poser, I want to learn as much about Buddhism as an average native Shinto-Buddhist syncretic in Japan would know, and even more if at all possible, even if I have to learn new languages. I want to form similar belief systems as the Japanese have for people that worship my ancestral pantheons (Germanic, Ibero-Roman and Kiche \[Mayan\]) and to walk in the eight-fold path until the end of my days.

I also want to note that the tradition of Bodhisattvas is absolutely amazing, it gives real hope that there is a path to becoming truly good and attaining wisdom great enough to cause the universe to hold you higher in esteem than a typical person. Real spiritual meritocracy really isn't present in the religions my culture generally practices. I wonder if this belief is present in all three schools, or do I have to choose one?

If there's any way I could be a part of all three traditions I would do so. I would love to mix and match and see what works and what I should believe and do even if they don't. I want to be parted from the greed I have a natural inclination towards, and to practice good morality rather than spend my time in making plans to get money when there are vastly more important things to do in life, even when you're poor.",Buddhism,1705143289.0,t3_195li5i,1.0,3
Dwelling in the present moment when going through hardships ...,"One of the themes that keeps coming up again and again for all the books I read on the Buddha's teachings is the idea of impermanence and focusing on the breath in order to help us be in the present moment. 

I understand how this might help somebody who is in a situation where the past is filled with regrets or anger. The future is filled with fear or uncertainty. The past is gone, the future has not come.

 Thinking about how everything is subject to change, how nothing is permanent, and focusing on the present moment where things might not be as bad can definitely help ease the fears, stress, and anxiety. At the monastery that I visit, the monks usually ask us ""are you always experiencing this .... Are you experiencing X negative emotion right now?"" During the process of meditation. The answer is usually no, but some people's present moment might be full of pain. 

 When things get really really bad in the present moment ... Wouldn't putting all your focus in the current present moment suffering just be like shooting that second arrow?

If your present moment is full of fear. If your present moment is a terrible moment. Perhaps you are at death's door, maybe you're going through physical abuse or trauma, maybe even being actively punched in the face right now, with nothing you could do to stop the punishment or pain, perhaps beaten in their prison cell, why would you try to focus on this present moment? 

I get that the present moment is all there really is, but I think for some people their day-to-day existence, their present moments can be filled with so much horror, so much pain and suffering, that the only thing that keeps them from ending their lives here and now is to dwell elsewhere, even if it's just an illusion.",Buddhism,1705136286.0,t3_195juoi,0.83,4

Or does this teaching mean that material things exist in changing states but that everything is devoid of meaning? And if that's the case, what's the point of doing or making anything? Is life itself empty and therefore pointless?

A Wave of Teen Suicides Stopped by Amitabha Buddha‚Äôs Name,"# A Wave of Teen Suicides Stopped by Amitabha Buddha‚Äôs Name

by [**Dharma Master Jing Zong**](https://plbi.org/?author=7) [November 20, 2021](https://plbi.org/?p=304)

An Indian native woman from Tulalip (about 60 km north of Seattle) of the Washington State, came to take refuge in Vancouver on 29th October, 2016. Her name is Verna Hill, about 50 in age. She mentioned about a school shooting case that took place in a high school of her district on 24 October, 2014. The shooter was a grandson of one of the tribal elders ‚Äì and her nephew. Because he didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúgo alone,‚Äù he invited his cousins (who were about the same age as himself) to meet at the school cafeteria, and shot them. Four were fatally wounded, and another was left in critical condition. The shooter then took his own life. The incident was reported in the media: Hundreds of people prayed in the church for the victims and their dependents on that day. But the horror did not end there. Verna then recounted how, beginning in April of this year (2016), a rash of suicide attempts broke out among the teens of the tribe. Over a period of twelve weeks, a growing number of these attempts proved successful, with several of the teens making similar posts on Facebook before committing suicide: ‚ÄúI have lost so many friends, I can no longer bear to live. I want to go with them because life in this world is meaningless.‚Äù Ominously, they also wrote: ‚ÄúI can hear them calling me, whispering in my ear.‚Äù¬†

As news of these events spread, so did the anxiety among the parents of the tribe. Everyone paid close attention to their children, growing frantic if one of them went missing for even an hour. Within just a few months, six teenagers ended their lives by hanging themselves. No one knew who would be next. The alarm and panic in the community were at fever pitch, and none of the local health care professionals, despite their best efforts, seemed capable of preventing yet another tragedy.¬†

Native Indians in this region worship their ancestors as part of their traditional, shamanistic beliefs. Because many of their ancestors have generated heavy karmic debts through the offense of killing, they have been reincarnated in the ghost realm and have been unable to find deliverance. In the case of this school shooting, the situation is even more complicated, as the victims were in an acute state of fear at the time of death. Their sense of betrayal and rage meant that their spirit-incarnations continually sought relief by returning to their community and becoming destructively entangled in the lives of their peers. Some months prior to her taking refuge, Verna reported these matters to Nadia „ÄÇ¬†

Some months prior to her taking refuge, Verna reported these matters to lay practitioner Nadia Liu (Buddhist name: Fozhang), a Chinese herbal doctor originally from Taiwan. Verna is the patient of Nadia, who is also the doctor of many of the relatives of the teens who committed suicide.¬†

Lay practitioner Fozhang found this situation to be urgent and told them, ‚ÄúYou should practice Nianfo. Reciting Namo Amituofo should relieve your suffering.‚Äù She gave them some Amitabha recitation machines, and invited them to recite along while playing the recitation at home. Certain members of the community were receptive to the idea; they gratefully received lay practitioner Fozhang‚Äôs instructions and began to practice. There was even one 28-year- old woman who told how she once recited over 2,000 times in one day.¬†

About four weeks prior to this writing, Verna told Lay practitioner Fozhang that the months-long wave of teen suicides had, at last, come to an end.¬†

Verna said to me, ‚ÄúI came to Vancouver to listen to the Buddha‚Äôs teaching, and you give me hope that I truly can touch another world: the Land of Bliss. Through this teaching, I was able to send these blessings to my ancestors ‚Äì and those helpless teens ‚Äì that they could all be delivered to the Pure Land and liberated from their suffering.‚Äù¬†

As Nadia narrated this to me in Chinese, Verna could not keep from sobbing. She understood well the inconceivable power of Amitabha-recitation, and her tears flowed freely in gratitude and release. All the karmic entanglements of the past few hundred years were resolved, and her ancestors were delivered and liberated. It was for this reason that Verna took refuge in Vancouver.¬†

Since taking refuge, Verna regularly recites ‚ÄúNamo Amituofo.‚Äù People in her tribe are curious about the gold-plated Amitabha-Name pendant that she is wearing. They ask her what it is and touch it with their hands.¬†

Amitabha-recitation is so simple. All people, without discrimination, are favored by Amitabha Buddha and can enjoy the benefits of his grace.¬†The members of this Indian tribe had not studied the Dharma and knew virtually nothing about Buddhism. They were totally unfamiliar with Amitabha Buddha, and yet they received the most efficacious response from him through the recitation of his name.¬†

Faith in, and reliance on, Amitabha Buddha is not a kind of religion, and does not interfere with any other religious belief. Anyone who recites his name will be cleared of their karmic offenses, embraced by his light and reborn in the Pure Land. This is all through the power of Namo Amitabha. His name is a simple fact ‚Äì a truth that anyone can put to the test. As in Verna‚Äôs case, proof of its effectiveness will not be found lacking.¬†

No matter what religion one believes in, we all have basic needs. We all need to eat, drink, exercise, and enjoy the sunlight. Truly, we all need to recite Amitabha‚Äôs name, as well. (End)",Buddhism,1705091574.0,t3_19550tz,0.72,9
Vipassana tought by Goenka,"I want to know what Buddhist think of the Vipassana Movement of Goenka?  
For me, Goenka is one of my heroes and i have very few. 

I am interested in Buddhism since the last 30 years of my life. For me, the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path are true and i believe that they can lead you to nirvana, which is not a place after you are death, but a state of mind in this life that is free from suffering.

In my journey, i read many books of the dalay lama and other ""higher"" Buddhist and went to a Buddhist center of the diamond way Buddhism for three years. I stopped going to the center, because it looked for me more like a religion and something like Scientology.

There where two key experiences why i left the center. One was a big gathering in germany with a high Buddhist of the Karma Kagyu school. I did not went but after the gathering i witnessed a event that i really disliked. Two persons talked about the gathering. One was there, one not. The person who was there, told the other person that he took notes about the gathering that he can provide. Than an other person intervened and told them, that the high Buddhist of the gathering would cry if he know that someone took nodes, because it is an oral tradition and also, the person that was not at the gathering, is not at a level that the teaching of the high Buddhist is for him.  
For me, it sounded like scientology, where it is forbidden to tell lower scientologiest the crap of Xenu the extraterrestrial ruler, because they will not understand it in the moment.

An other event was were some member of the center had a dying child and we watched a video about buddhist dying from Lama Ole Nydahl. That it is best for you to sit with your head to the sky in the moment of dying, because your ""soul"" can leave your body better and this gives you a better start in your next life. For me, this is made up crap with no evidence.

But i really missed the meditation in the center and therefor i ended in a 10 day vipassna retreat of Goenka. There i learned to meditate better in this 10 days than in three years in the center. For me, the vipassana retreat ticked all my boxes. In the Diamond Way Buddhism the main meditation is about the 16 Karmapa. Where you ""imagine"" that the Karmapa ""sits"" in front of you with his black crown.  
In the Vipassana Movement, you have two meditations. The Anapana meditation (Breath) and the Vipassana meditation (Body scan). For me, i think that Goenka is right about this meditation. In the meditation of the diamond way, you are not in the moment. You create an illusion and while you can get calm and more concentrated with it, you are not able to reach your subconscious and train it to lose the normal pattern of your mind. Which is necessary to reach nirvana.

For me, the vipassana meditation is a neurofeedback therapy that buddha developed 2500 years before we understand what a neurofeedback therapy is. My problem with my journey into buddhism, was, that it was much more intellectual than practical. But your subconscious doesn't care about your intellectual understanding. It is still reacting like it reacted all your life. Yes, you know that the key to a better live is to have equanimity, but how you you make your subconscious equanimous? 

This can be done with the ""neurofeedback therapy"" called vipassna. With vipassana, you get more and more aware of your body feelings. Then, you have the three daily hours of sitting of strong determination in the retreat. Where you try not to move for one hour. This is like torture. But this is where the ""magic"" happens and you can retrain your subconscious. 

The hour starts with singing and some instructions. Than it is silence and after 55 minutes, Goenka sings again and the hour ends. After getting more and more aware about your body feelings, you are getting aware, that in the moment you start to wish that Goenka starts singing, so your torture is near an end, your situation gets worse. But when you have equanimity with your situation, your situation gets instantly much better. The torture like situation helps you find the place in your brain to be equanimous. It is not the intellectual understanding that if you have equanimity, the situation is better for you, it is a real experience of this fact. 

Normally, your subconscious let you react with flight or fight in unpleasant situations. You crave that your situation change and now you and your subconscious learn that your cravings and your aversions make your situation worse. That accepting the situation like it is, makes it much better.

For me, this made my life much much better. For example. I had a life long enemy. The cold. Every time i got cold, it was like horror for me. Every winter in my life was crap. In my first retreat, i lost this enemy. The retreat was in the winter time and there was snow. Normally, i hated it leaving the meditation hall to getting to the sleeping quarters. It was cold. After my third sitting of strong determination, i went out of the hall and it was not like before. I was really shocked. I went to a park bench and sit there in a t-shirt and watched the cold on my skin. I cried because it was not the horror i had all my life anymore. I had equanimity with the situation and therefor the cold was only there but i did not blow it up to horror like i used to. Since then, every winter was a piece of cake for me. Cold is now a normal feeling and not an enemy anymore.

Next week, i have my forth retreat. In the last one, i reached a point, where i reached total equanimity to a degree i never reached before. Because i once broke my tailbone, my tailbone really hurts after a few days meditating for 10 hours a day. In the last retreat, there was no difference between a nice feeling of joy in my hands and the burning pain in my tailbone. I was totally equanimous with the situation and was watching the feelings without judging them. It was really strange to have the same feeling of interesting observing without judging for a nice feeling and for a bad feeling.

I think this is the way to nirvana and i thing the vipassna retreats from Goenka are much more effective teaching your subconscious buddhas insides than any other method i can imagine.

Actors and the Hell of Laughter,"So, since actors are getting karma leading to the hell of laughter, do we assume musicians get the same?

In other words, does the reading stand in terms of purpose (entertainers are bad). Or does it stand prescriptively (as *only* applying to actors)? 

I think the stuff about actors getting bad karma precludes my involvement in Buddhism. It shows how local and provincial the religion is. It's a cultural admonition that only applies to that time, so what do we do with it now?

Why can‚Äôt people seem to progress past the first noble truth?,"I‚Äôm so tired of people telling me that Buddhism is the most depressing and pessimistic of all religions 

It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm out here proselytizing but I live in a very religiously diverse location so I‚Äôm around Christians, Muslims, Scientologist, Mormons and even Hindus 


So many people try to throw Buddhism under the bus by using the same played out criticism that the Buddha himself had to correct the followers of other sects on which is‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.Buddhism is nihilistic, pessimistic, and life negating 

Its like the other 3 noble truths don‚Äôt exist 

The Buddha found a way out of suffering 

He found the cure to suffering 

That‚Äôs not pessimistic that gives us hope and optimism 

Acknowledging that life can be unbearable isn‚Äôt a negative thing only by acknowledging the problem can we then work towards a solution to it 

That‚Äôs exactly what the Buddha did 

I just don‚Äôt get it how people can accuse Buddhism of being some emo pity party when those same religions have the most terrible beliefs themselves 

I remember going to church and being told that the purpose of my life was to worship god and be a vessel for him to use for his own glory 

What I want didn‚Äôt matter my pain and suffering didn‚Äôt matter because I was just a pawn in God‚Äôs cosmic plan 

And then it didn‚Äôt help that I was under constant threat of the end times and wondering whether or not I would be in the rapture 

I remember crying as a kid because my mom told me Jesus would return before I was an adult and I was sad that the world would be destroyed before I got to live out my whole life 

Talk about nihilistic‚Ä¶talk about life negating 


Luckily my mom bought me a religious dictionary so I could learn about all the false non Christian religions so I could debate nonbelievers and win them over to Christ‚Ä¶.it had a big section on Buddhism that i read over and over again because life finally made sense to me!!!!

Prayers/Chants for Dying Cat (and Euthanasia),"Hi All,

My cat is dying. She's in very bad shape. We took her to the vet and we were given the option to euthanize. Honestly, she's so bad off I'm not sure I made the right decision to take her home (for now at least). We will update the vet tomorrow and decide if we should euthanize. I'm open to debate on this, because I don't know what to do. I know the standard advice is that it's always wrong. Fair enough...

But Regardless I think her days (likely hours) are numbered. For those of you who believe in transmitting merit I would humbly ask anyone who would like to to pray, chant, or meditate for her benefit. And if you would like to share any chants you like that I could do for my cat I would love those as well.

Thank you. üôè

Holy objects make it possible for sentient beings to create the cause to meet the Dharma and actualize the path. -- Lama Zopa Rinpoche,"> As soon as st≈´pas and statues of the Buddha are made, they have the power to cause sentient beings to do actions such as circumambulating, prostrating, offering, and so forth, which then become virtuous actions creating the cause of enlightenment, even if those actions are done with the eight worldly dharmas and nonvirtuous thoughts. These holy objects make it possible for sentient beings to create the cause to meet the Dharma and actualize the path. So even though we who are making these holy objects do not have realizations such as bodhichitta or emptiness, nor have we reached any of the bodhisattva bhumis, the holy objects we make still have the power to liberate sentient beings from the oceans of samsaric suffering, to actualize all the realizations of the path‚Äîguru devotion, the three principles of the path, and the two stages‚Äîand then to achieve enlightenment.

You might forget this natural process, or you might not believe in it, because the ripening does not always happen immediately.

Help with hurt in a friendship,"I would like some advice about how to proceed in a friendship...

I have known someone for about 2 years, we are coworkers together and are lightly friends outside of that. I would describe it as a ""budding"" friendship... we are quite different, from different walks of life, different coasts, different age demographics... but had a nice emotional connection developing.

About 3 months ago, I bought a house - my first one (!) which meant a lot to me, my parents have not supported me since I was 18 and I have had a chaotic upbringing. It's not particularly nice, about 900 sf and not in a nice area, but owning a house at all means a lot these days and is not an easy thing to accomplish.

Anyway, I told this friend, thinking she would be excited for me, but I was met with silence and that she needed time to process that. Her first response was ""wow"" and not much else. A couple of days later she congratulated me but it felt very forced, and was caveated by being very surprised and uncertain about this development. Given we are from very different parts of the country, I kind of just figured this was normal for her and didn't make too much of it (people are much more 'authentic' here, so slower... don't respond fakely which I appreciate).

Since then things have felt off - one day she asked how I was doing and I mentioned how stressful the homebuying process was, and once again, she kind of became cold and shut down. I just figured it was a weird day. But then again... I mentioned taking a trip out of town the last weekend before the house closed and again... this same response of just coldness.

I brought it up one day a few weeks later and she mentioned that she has felt it very difficult to connect with me since learning I am buying a house, as there are many other things that she would do if she had that kind of money (donate to homelessness causes, indigenous groups, etc) and that owning property was not something she ever wants to be a part of. I felt quite judged, and typecast and misunderstood, honestly, and she told me that she was ""glad I could talk honestly about this type of thing"" (I gave her a background about how I was able to afford buying the house because, for whatever reason, I didn't want her to think my parents had bought it for me or anything). Mind you I am 8 years older than she is so we are in very different phases of life and financial positions.

I am just lost how to move forward. It feels hard to generate compassion for her, because I feel put into some category. Maybe I can get to compassion by seeing that either she is envious, or things that are important to her feel directly threatened (I.e., by owning a house maybe I am disenfranchising local community members who would like to buy a house, or driving up property prices, etc). I think I can understand and have compassion for that, I mean I was in my 20s once and believed so many different things about how the world should work then I do believe now.  But it feels very hard to continue a friendship in the same way. Whatever trust I had about her sense of things feels gone, and I find myself hesitant to share things about myself with her. Maybe the peaceful answer is to realize I know more now and let the friendship go but still think of her fondly as a friend along the path, developing her own sense of things? 

But maybe that is my own insecurity and fear that I need to work past in order to see her differently. I think it's hard not to fall into traps of bemoaning her ""that's so mean"", ""that's so judgmental"", ""oh she's just jealous"" - but all of these feel arrogant on some level and put me above her (when we are all prone to acting like this, I certainly am!) and don't actually ease the discomfort I feel around it.

Worthwhile employers to work for? (Question tailored to those who work in tech but are also Buddhist),"I‚Äôve been working in tech for nearly 15 years now. Most of the work I‚Äôve done, although complex and in-depth from a technical perspective, the end product is usually for mundane internal reports that are not important to society at all or even worse, detrimental. The end goal is usually to make some wealthy person even wealthier. Frequently in toxic corporate encironments. Currently I work for a company that performs price optimization services for other companiesüôÑ. It is automated price gouging. A PE firm took over a few tears ago and works everyone to the bone.

If there is no self then who gets reborn?,"I know the answer is pragmatically ""nobody"", but my question is really intended to assess the veracity of some deeper appraissals of rebirth I've made:

Because there is no discrete, stable self, yet consciousness evidently exists, then by extension consciousness can be viewed as the universe/Samsara experiencing itself.

Thus upon death, the illusion of self is destructed, and consciousness continues in every life form after ""my"" death. ""We/I"" goes back to the process of space-time expansion which inevitably becomes more consciousnesses, all at once.

Thus, it is not ""me"" that is reborn, but the universe endlessly creating consciousnesses in the cyclical process that I share in common.

Does this align with the Buddhist notion of rebirth? I come from a Western scientific/materialist background so my assessment is prone to error.

Otherwise, rebirth would require some notion of soul, if it is truly ""me"" who is reborn, no?",Buddhism,1704961902.0,t3_193wx4w,0.84,36
Skillful Means v False Speech (Christian Edition),"I currently reside in the human realm, in a predominantly Christian country.

Some people in my life, especially older ones, only know and rely on their local brand of Christianity. That wouldn't be so bad if they didn't sporadically torture themselves for their past 'sins'. At the same time they cause more suffering for themselves and others.

Sometimes, these people seem to reach out to me. They are not exactly asking questions, but rather unsolicitedly start talking about sin and salvation. I feel as if they expect some kind of reaction from me, but I usually only resort to nodding and smiling.

Should I share the crumbs of wisdom that I picked up from studying the Buddha Dharma with them? If so, is it skillful to use Christian rhetoric (including concepts and terms that are completely absent or negated in Buddhism)?

I saw it but now it's gone,"So about two weeks ago, while meditating, I suddenly came to the realisation that there is no self. I suddenly felt how everything is interconnected and that separation is an illusion. It felt a lot like what people describe happens when they take mushrooms, except I was sober and just meditating in my room. For about a week, everything was so clear to me. I could clearly see where suffering comes from, and I felt immense compassion for all living beings. It was because of this insight that I stumbled upon buddhist teaching in the first place. I had never really studied Buddhism before this.   


However, it seems that the fog has come back and obscured my vision again. The realisation/feeling is no longer there. The intellectual understanding is there, but as is often told; this is not something to intellectually grasp, it is something to 'see' or experience. It is like I got a small glimpse of the true nature of things, but normal life has taken over again.   


Has anyone had anything similar to this happen to them? And if so, how did you find your way back to this view of reality? 

(I understand the irony of asking this, since it seems I am looking for a nice feeling for myself, when I just realised there is no self, and this is leading to suffering. However, it is not necessarily the nice feeling I'm looking for. I want to see reality for what it is, and I want to feel that compassion, since I felt extremely motivated to go into the world and help people/animals/nature. The feeling of inner peace is just a byproduct of this view I believe.)",Buddhism,1704965957.0,t3_193xv8l,0.88,16
The Sutra in Forty-two Sections Spoken by the Buddha,"When the World Honored One had attained the Way, he thought, ""To leave desire behind and to gain calm-ness and tranquillity is supreme. "" He abided in deep meditative concentration and subdued every demon and externalist.  
In the Deer Park he turned the Dharma-wheel of the Four Noble Truths and took across Ajnata-kaundinya and the other four disciples, who all realized the fruition of the Way.  
Then the Bhikshus expressed their doubts and asked the Buddha how to resolve them. The World Honored One taught and exhorted them, until one by one they awakened and gained enlightenment. After that, they each put their palms together, respectfully gave their assent, and followed the Buddha instructions.

Do the teachings of hell need to be taken literally?,"I just don‚Äôt understand WHY or HOW hell realms exist. Like why would entire universes exist just for the purpose of sadistic torture? How could such a universe arise spontaneously? How could beings evolve who simply seek the torture of others? What evolutionary benefit does that bring, and how could a society based on torture survive? Like I understand how there are times and places which contain greater and lesser levels of suffering, so maybe in that sense hell exists, but how could a hell exist which contains literal demons just torturing people?

2 questions,"Hey there :) Just to ask two questions to the folk in this subreddit 

Firstly, I know that name is an illusion, but should I classify myself as a Tibeten Buddhist or a Vajarayana Buddhist. I know that Vajrayana Buddhism is an umbrella term for different schools, including Tibetan Buddhism, but to me, the label ""Vajrayana Buddhist"" and ""Tibetan Buddhist"" have different conotations. ""Vajrayana Buddhist"" seems to infer someone who is actively participating in tantric rituals and whatnot wheras ""Tibetan Buddhist"" doesn't neccessarily seem to entail that, though it can. I know that I should be focused on focused on the teachings but this sort of thing does have an impact because first and foremost, should I go to a Vajrayana temple or Buddhist temple? Furthermore, it's a little hard to respond to ""what's your religion"" or ""which sect are you from"" if one doesn't know how to correctly represent their religion.

Secondly, do I need to attend an official ceromony to be a buddhist? I've already decided that hey, I'm a buddhist and I'm following it's teachings but do I need to officialy, in some actual ceromony, take refuge in the triple gem to be a buddhist? because right now, doing so would be awkward, difficult or even impossible. chance are, i'll have to wait a few more years before i'll be able to officially take refuge.

"As a layperson, the Buddhist idea of hell seems absurdly harsh. Why would it be so? Is it so?","I want to start this off by saying yes, I know that this isn‚Äôt some sort of crafted punishment used to indoctrinate people into dogma etc.

But up to billions of years in agony for killing someone from a place of fear, fear in a universe this unfamiliar, this unforgiving? Surely there must have been a miscommunication somewhere‚Ä¶ right? I would think a few hundred years would balance out even such a gruesome murder. Isn‚Äôt that a decent equilibrium, to suffer for all of the various sufferings it would have caused? 

Is the Buddhist view of this, ‚Äúit is what it is, tough shit, buddy?‚Äù I just find it so hard to believe that if a system were to randomly apparently exist its balance would be incomprehensibly heavy-handed beyond anything the receiving end could ever even dream of imagining.",Buddhism,1704908259.0,t3_193dz5t,0.91,100
Tsog Offerings,"Hi all,

I was thinking today that making Tsog/feast offerings is a great way to create blessings and merit for this life and the next.  Many spiritual texts say that feeding people is one of the most beneficial things you can do.  Many Tibetan Buddhists centers, such as Pema Osel Ling/Vajrayana Foundation, accept online donations for tsog offerings.  I can think of many other Tibetan Buddhist centers in California that receive online donations for tsog.  I am planning to make some donations toward tsog at a center soon.

Also, I've been thinking about a conversation I had with my Tibetan Buddhist teacher (a Tibetan lama).  He once told me when I was very sick, that it would be alright if I come to the center even if I cannot participate in meditation; he said if I just have the energy to enter the center and recite one om mani padme hum, and generate good thoughts, this is very beneficial for myself and others.  I haven't forgotten that, and thankfully I have the opportunity to visit a very nice temple in the next week, where I will be reflecting on this advice.  There is something special about holy places like practice centers, and any practice we do there with good thoughts carry tremendous blessings.

Also, just looking at videos and photos of holy objects like stupas, and generating good thoughts and thoughts of peace and devotion, generates merit and blessings.

Then, of course, there is life release.  Emperor Ashoka, while he was dying, used almost every bit of the treasury money available at the end of his life to ransom animals from slaughter.  As one of the greatest emperors in India's history, Ashoka truly lived what he preached.  He was ardently committed to saving the lives of animals at the end of his life, and he undertook great discipline and hard work to do this.  His ministers had to actually stop him at one point because they were afraid he would spend all of the treasury money.  However, Ashoka didn't do this because he was fanatical; it was out of genuine compassion and a kind heart.

Feel free to share your own practices for how to generate blessings.",Buddhism,1704983457.0,t3_194316u,0.75,2

Lack of energy for practice,"Can anyone direct me towards some Buddhist teachings on right effort, arousing energy for practice, and motivation- suttas, guided meditations, book recommendations, etc.?

Seeking guidance and motivation after placing too much importance on a single text,"I sincerely hope my concerns are met with patience, understanding, and compassion. 

As found inside the Anguttara NikƒÅya, in the book of the eights‚Ä¶:
‚ÄúƒÄnanda, if females had not gained the going forth from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One, the spiritual life would have lasted long. The true teaching would have remained for a thousand years. But since they have gained the going forth, now the spiritual life will not last long. The true teaching will remain only five hundred years. 
It‚Äôs like those families with many women and few men. They‚Äôre easy prey for bandits and thieves. In the same way, the spiritual life does not last long in a teaching and training where females gain the going forth. 
It‚Äôs like a field full of rice. Once the disease called ‚Äòwhite bones‚Äô attacks, it doesn‚Äôt last long. In the same way, the spiritual life does not last long in a teaching and training where females gain the going forth. 
It‚Äôs like a field full of sugar cane. Once the disease called ‚Äòred rot‚Äô attacks, it doesn‚Äôt last long. In the same way, the spiritual life does not last long in a teaching and training where females gain the going forth. 
As a man might build a dyke around a large lake as a precaution against the water overflowing, in the same way as a precaution I‚Äôve prescribed the eight principles of respect as not to be transgressed so long as life lasts.‚Äù

The quoted text, is a mere few excerpts from a single sutta inside the Book of the Eights. They are minute and few compared to the whole of the teaching, but after reading them recently‚Ä¶they have consumed my waking and sleeping thoughts, left me discouraged, and affected my emotional wellbeing. I rationally know I am making more of a single text than I should be, but it won‚Äôt get out of my head.

I have read many of the suttas, and keep book on them for where I may find certain passages and lessons. I will admit, too, that I am relatively new and inexperienced in the officially teaching, and lack a locally accessible manner in which to communicate with a spiritual advisor. I have a mind which is afflicted by several various disorders, and it is important to realise that this alone makes it difficult for me to proceed the same manner in which most might find works. Perhaps, too, this fact makes my progress along the path slower.

I am very susceptible to taking the words of someone I revere and relying on them to form the basis of my thought, and any sense of value I could possibly have of myself. I have come out of my worst mental states because of realising many aspects of Buddhism, and I respect the Buddha and the path immensely. 

I know the passage is speaking of the ordainment of a female follower, and not the capability of females to achieve enlightenment as a whole. But, in my mind, I have unfortunately taken any slight suggestion of a female being incapable of pursuing the path to the same extent and manner as a male to heart; as a reason to return to the belief that something is *wrong* with being a female and a follower.

Everything is impermanent, and is constantly changing; what Buddhist could refute that? The societal regard and the way in which it acts is just as susceptible to change, as is the seasons and the perspectives of one's own self. 
I know, the Buddha denied the notion he was superhuman, a figure that nobody else could ever hope to be even close to being like ‚Äî but is he not the Perfected One? He was accomplished in all ways, he had freed himself entirely from the cycle of rebirth. If he of all beings is so reluctant to ordain females‚Ä¶what right would a layperson have to dispute that? Other-where in the canon, it is even stated that as the processes worked for him, if they do not work for us, we must look to where we must improve or change. 

I understand that the passage directly confirms that females, too, can obtain enlightenment ‚Äî and I have read within the canon, too, the proof that the Buddha was not discriminatory or hypocritical as my brain is trying to force me to believe. But this alone doesn‚Äôt ease my mind, and I‚Äôm a little scared at the thought maybe I shouldn‚Äôt pursue enlightenment until I have a life reborn in a male body. It‚Äôs stupid, I know, but please understand it is hard to change this way of thinking. I‚Äôm trying my best, I really am, but sometimes I just need a little support and the minds of others to help me.


I know this perhaps comes-across as a rant ‚Äî but it isn‚Äôt my intention. In a time of trouble, and not knowing where to turn, I have decided to try and be reminded of the truth by those who can say it best. Please be patient with me. I‚Äôve reached out to various online communities before, which should have been places of compassion and kindness, to have my words received with vileness and exasperation. I need whoever chooses to respond to this to keep-in-mind I have a very afflicted way of thinking, and a concerningly low self-regard. I don‚Äôt have anywhere else to turn with this, and I‚Äôm not looking for honeyed words. Please, I just want someone to explain to me why this shouldn‚Äôt change how I feel about the Buddha and the path. I really am relying on gentle words.",Buddhism,1704989260.0,t3_19457uc,0.67,1

\~\~\~

Zen and Buddhist insights, timeless wisdom gathered over centuries, can help guide us in our lives today and in the prudent use of new technologies, nurturing a calm and serene world, prosperous yet existing in harmony with nature, a healthy, contented and good society for the centuries to come.

Let Zen inspire us to sometimes step back from our machines and digital devices, returning to the simple and old-fashioned ways, the slow ways, because they are beautiful ways. In the rush for improvement, let us learn to sit still sometimes and rest from our goals, drop the quest for constant upgrades and efficiency, restrain the endless hunger for progress, and turn off the flashing lights and ceaseless noise.

At the same time, if employed well, technology and medicine can help us bring true peace, an end to most wars and violence committed in anger, cures for diseases, ecological balance, greater love and empathy among people and for all beings, increased charity, remedies for poverty and homelessness, and the attainment of other goals for good in the world as long dreamed of by Buddhists and caring people of many religions and philosophies.

Tomorrow‚Äôs technologies will change Buddhism too. AI and robotics, bio-engineering and physical enhancements, genetics and nano-implants, virtual reality and new media, medical miracles and manufacturing marvels, extended lifespans and expanded minds will make many of Buddhism‚Äôs most fabulous ideals realizable. Zen will be practiced, programmed, bred and wired in; enlightenment will move as chemistry and light across neural fibers and optical fibers.

Can someone explain Buddhahood to me please?,"I‚Äôve heard the term quite often, much like enlightenment but to actually dissect what these stages are like is what I‚Äôm hoping to have a deeper/clearer understanding around. So thanks in advance. 
I was remembering a glimpse of what might have actually been kensh≈ç, as it‚Äôs the most fitting word I found. Since I have come to learn about terms like Satori and most recently came across Stream Entry, which I‚Äôm still learning about. My question is around the term Buddhahood, one is told to it‚Äôs the ultimate attainment so-to-speak, but what actually is it? I know it might be paradoxical to ask or even have it explained, but if there is dissolution of the self, and this sense of merging samadhi if we can borrow that word, typically from what I know the body is in a state of rest or deep meditation, is Buddhahood like that and yet still being here present in the world or?

Advice for a film student writing about buddhism,"Hello everyone!

feeling alien to my peers,"hello all! i (21m) have been practicing buddhism (mostly theravada) for nearly a year now. i meditate 1hr daily, i try to maintain my mindfulness in everyday life, and i abstain from entertainment (movies, tv, music) in an effort to avoid clouding my mind. im really appreciative of how much equanimity, peace, compassion, concentration, etc the practice has brought me thus far. 

i am having a difficulty though. while i feel the practice has brought me closer to myself and others in some ways, it‚Äôs made me feel more distant to others in some ways. im a college student, and i‚Äôve really realized how much we as people define ourselves in terms of our tastes in entertainment. im finding it very difficult to sustain meaningful conversations with many of my peers because i no longer have such definitive tastes in entertainment mediums, and don‚Äôt use social media (besides reddit). 

i used to be extremely into music, and had such eclectic and varied tastes. it was extremely easy for me to connect with others in regards to musical tastes. now that im not listening to much music, i find it difficult to find topics of conversation to truly connect with strangers on. most people my own age are not meditators and essentially have nothing to say in response when i convey that i practice. while i feel more connected to others than ever, i cant help but feel frustrated when it feels like i can never truly find common ground on a date or while hanging out with new people. if the other person‚Äôs interests venture outside of meditation, the gym, or tech, there‚Äôs usually not much common ground.

i‚Äôve ventured to the meditation and buddhism clubs of my local area to find a tribe, and they‚Äôre mostly either quite small or are mostly populated with older people. this is really isolating me, and im tempted to resume listening to music, or taking in entertainment not even for the pleasure of the medium, but simply to find more ways to relate to my peers. im skeptical because while i know this would give me more conversational topics, it‚Äôd almost certainly interfere with my concentration in meditation. any advice would be appreciated!",Buddhism,1704894342.0,t3_1938mgt,0.81,9

Called out during meditation for where my feet were?,"It took me three years to build the courage to visit the Wat temple near me, based on my own self judgement. I've experienced a lot of loss in the last two years. I am grieving and was looking for quiet comfort in the presence of those who practice compassion. 

An American practitioner, about 15y younger than myself, tapped me on the shoulder, during the meditation, to tell me that I wasn't sitting properly. The practitioner informed me that my legs were not to be pointed toward the Buddha. I feel it would have been better to let me know in private.

 I don't think this person was a representative of the temple, and after the session (?) I overheard them tell another group of ""first-timers"" (this person was standing very close to me, but talking past me to others standing next to me) that it was their 3rd week in town, that they had only been attending for the last two weeks, which made me feel more condescended. 

I don't think I want to return, as I thought the experience would have been more inclusive. I've been through enough judgement in my life, that's why I had such high hopes for this experience.

What to do when feeling spiritually lazy,"I‚Äôm 20 years old and have had a number of experiences over the last few years that have led to a tremendous shift in my outlook on life. If you look at my post history I‚Äôm sure you can guess what those experiences were.

But the crux of it is that regularly I feel that I am too lazy in my practice. I have turned towards lord Buddha as a source of wisdom, as his teachings and the generations of those who have come after him resonate deeply with my newfound outlook. However I find myself in what feels like a transitionary stage where I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm going or what I‚Äôm doing here and I can‚Äôt commit myself to any certain lifestyle.

I know that any 20 year old would have these feelings of directionlessness, but in my case I especially have a sense of guilt over it because I don‚Äôt pursue spiritual development, at least not to the degree of the expectations I‚Äôm setting for myself. My mind often treats me like an angry or disappointed parent, and it makes me feel small and helpless.

I don‚Äôt meditate as much as I think I should, and I just generally don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm doing as much as I should be when it comes to the path of ending suffering. I become fearful of the negative consequences my sloth will bring. I think to myself ‚ÄúWhy have I been gifted with such a tremendously lucky life if I‚Äôm only going to shirk my responsibilities?‚Äù 

I try to live my life as mindfully as possible, especially so since coming in contact with the insights and knowledge of Buddhism. I try to be kind to others and myself in all of my interactions and thoughts, and I try to analyze my patterns of behavior to get to the root of why I do the things I do. I don‚Äôt really meditate currently, I think it comes from a fear of not being good enough. But it causes me great stress that in spite of my attempts at goodness, I still might not be doing enough. 

I‚Äôm not certain how to overcome these feelings of fear, guilt and shame. I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm even writing this, thank you for reading it either way. I just want to feel like I am not evil anymore, and to find a comfortable pace and grounded view in life.",Buddhism,1704871453.0,t3_1932m6l,0.72,3
Vajra hell is pretty scary,"Vajra hell is pretty scary. It's just how tibetan buddhism calls to me in a way others sects don't but the concept of vajra hell- it's kinda scary man. 

It seems like (though I could be wrong), vajra hell is this kinda secretive thing in vajrayan buddhism- a hell reserved for those who disobey their teacher or break their samaya or something like that. Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche described it as a place of over rationalistic thinking. But it seems really scary. I can accept it if Vajra hell is just a state of mind of overly-rationalistic thinking, trying to scratch that can never seem to be scratched. But how am I to (when I'm older cuz i'm currently a teengager) take a teacher or take empowerments if somehow, this could lead me to some sort of literal hell?

Holding 2 opposing believes causing mental discomfort. Hope to cope?,"Hi guys!

I'm currently 21 years old, introverted, single and spend most of my time alone

I've always been interested in spirituality and philosophy, favourite author being Osho

But lately, I regret getting into the whole spirituality scene.

Spirituality and the theme of meditation teaches me to drop my ego and blend in with our natural selves. I, for a fact know that dropping the ego is the best thing to do, to accelerate learning and releasing natural intelligence

But, I'm also into business and investing which requires me to be conscious of money and be tight with certain believes. I can't drop my ego and do whatever, else it's a social suicide

You see my problem here?

One personality wants to be spiritual, intelligent and thinks that's the right thing

Other personality wants to be cunningly intelligent, rational and egoistic

I've been stuck between two of these and I'm so so tired of feeling this way. At this point, I can even call it cognitive dissonance

"What is the relationship between the non-self, karma, and rebirth?","For context, I'm new to practicing buddhism- sorry if this is a question already answered but I've been googling around and it's only giving me more questions. 

So, I understand that rebirth is like a candle, a new life is born from one flame, but is completely new in itself (and that this flame is not a ""soul"" due to the concept of the non-self/anatta). What I struggle with is how exactly rebirth works. Is samsara, or the wheel of life, turned through karmic actions? Say, is the candle's flame the karma generated in one life passed to another, to which the karma will be reformed (as in, released, created, etc.) in that next said life?

This then, leads me to my next question. The Buddha was, assumedly, doing things that would generate karma, however died and was freed from samsara (from what I understand). Is, then, Nirvana the achievement of no longer generating karma through attaining enlightenment? I don't quite understand how this connects to the concept of bodhisattvas. Does an enlightened one choose to allow their karmic energy to continue the cycle of samsara? Where does this karmic energy go if an enlightened one decides to become free of samsara? I feel like we could even take a step forward: if karma drives samsara and therefore the creation of life, nirvana then becomes a nearly godly plane: the choice to truly end the creation of life itself. (side note: It's really interesting how Christianity's goal is to live eternally in heaven in an afterlife when it seems like the goal of Buddhism is to finally die and be free from dukkha and samsara.)

Now I know that's pretty far out there and that's honestly me just pulling on a thread and seeing where I can go with it. If I'm completely wrong, that's fine LOL. I'm very grateful for any responses and answers.

I accidentally took a life of a black cat while driving to my weekly sangha meet up. How do I cope with this?,"Last Sunday I was driving to my local temple for my weekly sangha meeting.

Weighing Up the Buddhist Path," I have always had an attraction to Buddhism for one reason or another. I am quite relaxed but I live my life upon a set of principles that I use as a foundation for my conduct. The last few years have been quite challenging for me in that I had an illness (since addressed), my old high school friend died suddenly, a myriad of other smaller issues, and just recently my father is recovering from a near-fatal accident. I am not sure if it is because of these issues, or just personal development, but I have recently been exploring Buddhism and I have found a good deal of Buddha‚Äôs teachings align with many of my principles. That said, I am not calling myself a Buddhist yet - I am merely an observer weighing up the path. I am very much at the start of my journey, should it even develop into one, and I have come here to read the thoughts and opinions of Buddhists as part of my ‚Äòweighing up the path‚Äô. I wish to say that so far, this appears to be one of the more friendly subreddits I have come across. *It's perhaps why I feel more confident to post here.*

I am currently reading Approaching the Buddhist Path by His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Thubten Chodron. It is a nicely written and presented book, and I am enjoying it. Although I don‚Äôt quite understand everything being said, the central theme so far appears to orientate around wholesome acts, being a good person in this life, and the level-headedness of controlling one's emotions so as not to inadvertently make bad decisions that harm others or yourself. I am quite aware that these are only scratching the surface of Buddhism and that should I go deeper there are much greater lessons to help progress towards Nirvana and escape Samsara. Another part that interests me is the Middle Way which, if my understanding is correct, centres much around moderation - the grey area. This spoke to me quite strongly in that moderation and knowing that issues in life are seldom black or white is a central tenet to my principles.

So it seems to me Buddhism may provide a great deal to help me become a more wholesome individual in this life so that others may benefit, and better prepare me for the trials and suffering experienced. For a great deal of time, I was an Athiest. And although Science is beautiful and can offer ways of approaching life, it seems to feel somewhat ‚Äòcold‚Äô. To me religion seems to feel rather more ‚Äòwarm‚Äô - if that makes sense. That said, I don‚Äôt really consider myself to be ‚Äòreligious‚Äô per se but I think there is more to life than the pure cold rigidity of Science (as fascinating as it is). I am quite scientifically minded and so I think what attracts me to Buddhism somewhat - although I could be misguided - is that it doesn't seem as standoffish toward science as say what Christianity often appears to be. 

This is also what gives me a quandary about Buddhism. Rebirth being such an important aspect of Buddhism, is deemed impossible by science. So too is the concept of higher realms. Of course, one could reinterpret both of these to fit with scientific evidence; rebirth being metaphorical where one may be ‚Äòreborn‚Äô into a better person during one‚Äôs life, and the higher realms being other universes although transcendence is not possible. These are merely my musings of the uninformed or ignorant self and are very much still in development. 

All this being said. Another aspect described in my studies so far is non-attachment which can provide some interesting thoughts on life. So perhaps to adopt non-attachment towards Buddhism, I am not rushing headlong into it. I am looking at it, keeping an open mind, and looking to absorb what comes from it. As it stands so far, to the question, will I become a Buddhist? I don‚Äôt know, maybe, maybe not. And that‚Äôs before I even consider what sect.

"New to this, curious for how to start.","Tldr: Where do I start to learn more and good books

Hello!
For some more information on myself, I have a Evangelical background growing up. I grew away from the faith becoming very secular, despite being super interested in all things religious and philosophical.

I‚Äôve done research on different philosophies and religions wanting to improve myself and just curiosity to know more about the world. Buddhism is a little difficult for me to research compared to stuff like Islam or Christianity due to it being more like a philosophy with many different schools of thought. I was wondering if you guys would be able to help point me in the right direction <3",Buddhism,1704839371.0,t3_192rpnm,0.67,1

Is there really a difference between good and bad karma?,"I‚Äôve just been thinking about the fact that the more ‚Äúgood karma‚Äù you have, the more comfortable and ‚Äúgood‚Äù existence becomes in return, right? And then perhaps you‚Äôd have less reason to even want to get free ? 

Or for example if someone attains much good merit then maybe they get reborn into a lot of wealth and power in their next life and then with such wealth and power you often end up becoming corrupt. 

Or how they say that if you get born into a god realm, you likely would end up in a hell realm afterwards. Since you‚Äôve then used up all your good karmas and/or did not work on your liberation at all in that life because why would you? When life if so good with no hardship or suffering barely? 

I almost feel like if you have a decent amount of ‚Äúbad karma‚Äù it would be almost a better life in terms of motivation to become liberated ? Or maybe it‚Äôs almost the best thing to do to have an equal amount good and bad so that you just have an average,  happy life in general but still suffer enough to be a compassionate person with the desire to get free. 

I just found myself thinking about this when dedicating my merits at the end of meditation and asking to attain the good merits but maybe it‚Äôs better to have the bad ones too? It also makes me think about the whole ‚Äúwe want to get free from suffering‚Äù thing. Because I think suffering is so useful. Suffering brings me so much closer to ‚ÄúGod‚Äù. Suffering purifies me, helps me to keep my eye on the prize, and brings me closer to liberation and makes me a more compassionate and understanding person and gives me a better perspective on the world and my spirituality.  

Anyways, hopefully this makes sense. Is there really a difference between good and bad karma when good karma may lead to suffering anyways once it‚Äôs spent and you‚Äôve become corrupt by too much abundance, accumulating ten times the bad karma as you did before? and bad karma would actually be good because it purifies you and leads you onto the path of liberation more swiftly and strongly?",Buddhism,1704838767.0,t3_192rgni,0.5,0

Lacking the clarity to understand what is skilful speech or action.,"I have been reading Pema Chodron‚Äôs book ‚ÄòWhen things fall apart‚Äô while grieving over the abuse from my ex-partner (41F) who suffers from borderline personality disorder (BPD). This abuse has also started coming from my daughter (10F) as she follows her mother‚Äôs example. To avoid conflict, I have surrendered all attempts at parenting. I am in an ethical dilemma. I strongly believe that my daughter needs a male role model, although my ex devalues me at every opportunity which has now taught my daughter to devalue me and at a later stage perhaps devalue men in general. I have left my daughters life before because I could not endure the humiliation and devaluing of my ex as it was causing fighting that was damaging to my daughter. Since then, my practice has evolved, and I now have the self-awareness and control not to react. I believe my ex thinks that we have a good relationship being unaware or unwilling to accept the damage her abusive behaviours cause. 

I accept that this is karma, that I have played a role and I am coming to the realization of emptiness of self that says to me that the universe in general (my parents, her parents and the environment in which we both grew up) has played a large role in this situation coming to fruition. I have a strong desire to reduce suffering in my daughter, myself and my ex. I practice metta meditation and tonglen regularly. Even though my ex is abusive to other people and me, I do not blame her, I have compassion for her and appreciate she did not choose to be a neglected child. Even when I get to the place where her weapons become flowers or gifts to teach me more about myself, deepen myself awareness and can no longer hurt me. I hold strong concerns for my daughter as she matures as she is young and has no dharma. I cannot rely on the law for justice or protection of my daughter. I believe my problem is that I lack the foresight to be confident on what is the path of least suffering for all concerned. It seems to me that the ethical path, honest communication with my daughter will cause enormous suffering in our lives.",Buddhism,1704801548.0,t3_192d46s,0.88,6
Questions about Buddhism,"I am currently a Christian and do not know much about Buddhism, but I have some Buddhist people in my life, and I am trying to understand some questions I think about often. 

1. I understand that life is suffering, but why? The best answer I can find is Karma for past lives manifesting in one's current life. But why should I have to suffer now for something that I did in a past life? After all, I have no memory of it, and I feel no attachment to any past lives. My brain now in this life chooses my actions now. So why do I have to pay for things that I did in previous lives?

2. If reincarnation is true, how far back does it go? I mean, at some point in history, the first life EVER came into existence, right? And then there were more and more lives. It seems there is no way that every organism alive has past lives that date all the way back to even 1,000 years ago, because, whether human or otherwise, there is simply more life in existence today than there was 1,000 years ago. So then there must be lives that exist now that have had no past lives whatsoever, right? So where do those new lives come from? And how do they experience Karma and things like that?

Serious question: can I min/max my karma in this life?,"Hi all, I'm new to buddhism but I'm trying to figure things out. Long story short, is it reasonable to accumulate a little bad karma (i.e. engage in unethical practices) in order to gain enough resources to accumulate a ton of good karma later (i.e. donating lots of money to monasteries and such for karma transfer)?

A Few Death Resources,"Hi everyone, I wrote a post a few days ago about preparing for death.  I appreciated all of the responses and I know that all of us take this work of meeting death seriously, as it one of the most important experiences/challenges we all face.

I hope this is okay, as this is a Buddhist forum, but I wanted to share something I learned recently from attending a death cafe.  This is relevant, because death is essentially around the corner for all of us, and is an important element of buddhist practice and contemplation; and there are a lot of things to prepare that many people don't have the chance to get to (because death can come unexpectedly for many of us).

There are mobile apps (e.g. MyDirectives mobile app, and MYLO) where you can upload your advance directives via your phone and then the hospital can us the app to take in the information on your advance directive.  One of the most common things that happens is people fill out the advance directive and then forget to make a copy and file it with the hospital.  Instead, they let it sit in a file cabinet at home, and potentially the hospitals never has access to it and relatives don't know it's there.  The hospital or doctors office should have a copy on file so they know your wishes.  What I found is many hospitals will only allow you to leave a copy of your Advance Directive on file if you have been a patient there in the past, so this new MyDirectives mobile app and also the MYLO app is a way to get your health care wishes potentially met; which can save a lot of suffering.  (The American Bar Association displays and recommends the MYLO App - which stands for ""Mind Your Loved Ones"".  This app allows you to send information directly to health care providers, whether doctor, hospital, insurance company, family/friends, via email, fax, print, or text.  Information is not stored on the cloud, but locally in the user's tablet or smartphone, and MYLO has no access to a user's profile beyond an email address and registered name.)

Also, I highly recommend the book ""Last Rights: Rescuing the End of Life from the Medical System"", by Stephen Kiernan.  It is full of practical advice for navigating the health care maze and advocating for your dying loved ones, in order to alleviate their suffering.  It is just an awesome book.  I bought it about 5-6 years ago.

Also, there are several hospices around the U.S. with zen gardens and beautiful surroundings, as well as spiritual and other edifying.  Perhaps people who are looking for something a little different than the traditional at home hospice or other hospices may consider researching to find these facilities and planning for this well in advance so this service will be available to you at the time of death.  It can be very encouraging to die in an environment of peace.

Beliefs in God or Gods,"Hello I am relatively new to the practice and have been doing a lot of my own studies with the Plum village app, I‚Äôve recently joined the Zen Peace Order and have been reading The Art of Living by Thich Nhat Hanh.

Also would life force be similar to a creator God. Im formally Christian and have found a lot of similarities in Christianity, Judaism and Buddhism.

Meditation,"Sorry if this is a silly question, I don't really have anyone to talk to or ask questions on these things.

I always thought meditation meant an empty mind but I've never been able to clear my head of thoughts which is only made trickier by my mental illness.

What I have found though is stopping all my busy thoughts by focusing on how the things around me are connected and the beauty in being here in the moment because this moment only exists for, well, a moment and it makes me feel blessed to be there. The beautiful birds I hear have made a safe haven in the soothing trees I can hear blowing in the wind. The car going by wouldn't exist without teams of people that worked hard to get it there. The water from the river might become the same water that keeps me hydrated and healthy or perhaps some of it will be the rain nourishing the ground and calming me with it's pitter pattering. 

I feel like it makes me appreciate impermanence if that makes sense because this moment only exists now. One day those birds I hear will die and that's okay, the trees might fall and that's also okay. Maybe the wood will be used for something or perhaps it will nourish the earth with it's rot. It doesn't really matter what becomes of anything I hear. I am just lucky to have been a part of their background as they are to me. I am lucky to have witnessed their existence.

Is this meditation? Is this a decent starting place? Or am I completely wrong and this is just a new grounding tool I've found to help with my mental health?

Why is compassion necessary?,"I came from a very dark place in life. I have practiced meditation and contemplated over the basic doctrines intensively for around 1 month, and I agree with the fundamental ideas in Buddhism, especially the Three Marks of Existence, Four Noble Truths, Noble Eightfold Path, Anatta, Sunyata, Karma, etc.

However, one thing I cannot understand is why compassion and loving-kindness is the answer. I understand that we are all interconnected as one, bound by the chain of Karma. I understand that compassion and loving-kindness would lead to good karma. In the cases where people hurt us, I understand that they may not have done those things based on their own will because their 5 aggregates are out of their control. They are constrained by their past experiences, genetic and evolutionary traits, survival instinct, and many other external factors. I see understanding as the answer, but I cannot agree on compassion as the answer.

For example, I was used and manipulated in my past relationship in a very harsh way (from my perspective). I can finally get over anger or vengeance for her because I understand that she, just like me, is suffering from a lack of control over her own thoughts and emotions. I can also finally understand that the pain I received from her is a delusion conditioned on the premise that my ego exists and matters. However, I simply refuse to show compassion and loving-kindness to people like this, even after processing all my emotions and identifying the root conditions for the karma cause. While we are all interconnected as one, I would rather result in a net zero by being fully indifferent to them than showing compassion for them. While indifference is one of the Three Poisons, I understand where their hurtful actions may come from. I just simply cannot show compassion.

a good and a bad person,"i am still trying to unlearn some black and white terms so if i mistake someone go ahead and correct me. 

but there is no such thing as good or a bad person. ill admit it does kind of hurt my ego, because i feel like i am a good enough person to say that i am a good person. plus it makes me feel better. but feeding into the ego is toxic.  

but instead of calling someone you dislike or someone who has abused you a bad person we could use words like ‚Äúunaligned‚Äù and ‚Äúdiscouraged‚Äù ‚Äútoxic/harmful‚Äù or ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù i feel like we need to use more adjectives.

there is no such thing as a good person either. because you can still be the most compassionate and loving person and still be very flawed. no human being is a straight line.

"Just found an old statue of Budai. What is the most respectful way to store it, and do you have any info concerning its iconography ?","Hello and good day to everyone. Please excuse me if there are some mistakes in this post, or if something is unclear, English is my third language.

My mom and I found in our attic a small wooden statue of Budai. It was probably bought ou stolen by one of my ancestors, a colonial officer, during the French Conquest of Indochina. Apparently, according to my late grandfather, the statue has some significant value, but I can't be sure. I joined some pictures of the statue.

As you can see, Budai is standing on a bag, his hands are turning into leaves and fruits. Personally I find it very nice, and  I looked up online a lot of statues in the Vietnamese national collections, but have not seen anything similar, in terms of iconography.

I am not well-versed at all in Buddhism, nor its practices and iconography.  Are the sculptures considered sacred ?  Should they be maintained in a special way? What is the most respectful way to store it?

We are considering getting it examined, along with some other artefacts by an expert. We do not intend to sell it at all, but if it does have some cultural, spiritual or artistic value, we'd like to try and donate it back to its home country.

What is the role of prayer in Buddhism?,"TL;DR: Buddhism has varying views of the supernaturality of the life of the Buddha. I've seen some prayers directed towards Buddha requesting certain things such as peace or calmness.

What view of the Buddha is prerequisite for us to think these prayers have an effect? What is the role of prayer in practice in your view? Does the Buddha exist in a realm beyond able to action these prayers?

Long post:

I'm beginning to get familiarity with Buddhist philosophy and some practices. That being said there's an area of practice I still find a bit confusing which is that of prayer. 

I've seen in a couple Buddhist centres prayers asking things of the Buddha or directed towards him or other Buddhas and supposedly enlightened recent teachers. 

I'm wondering within a Buddhist framework what is the purpose of these prayers? How do they work, is Buddha alive somewhere beyond acting upon them? Are they just for us and framed in that way to help use previous religious practices of the day for Buddhist purposes? 

Although some texts give Buddha very supernatural surroundings to his time on earth others are very plain and non miraculous. What sort of view of Buddha would we need to have to believe these prayers have an effect on our world. Any thoughts or views would be greatly appreciated!",Buddhism,1704707691.0,t3_191hpss,0.83,11

"Why is it considered karmically acceptable to eat meat, but ‚Äúwrong livelihood‚Äù to engage in the sale/trade of it?","I just don‚Äôt really understand the logical explanation for this. Either way you are contributing to the death of an animal by either purchasing and cooking meat or by selling it. From a vegetarian/vegan standpoint for example, buying and consuming meat should be regarded as being just as harmful as the people responsible for industrial farming and the slaughter of animals. To me this makes sense logically. What is the difference? You are still contributing to the profit of these industries so how exactly does this exempt you from bad karma? I‚Äôve even seen people go so far in this sub to say that merely working in a restaurant or a grocery store should be considered generative of ‚Äúbad karma‚Äù or indicative of ‚Äúwrong livelihood,‚Äù and that they would never allow themselves to be in these professions; while those same people will likely eat meat with no qualms because the Buddha did not expressly forbid it. 

It just seems like a kind of holier-than-thou attitude I wouldn‚Äôt normally expect from Buddhism. I suppose this attitude just leaves a bad taste in my mouth and is the primary problem I have always had with religion. Consider for example, many working class jobs that are available to those without higher education are in fact restaurant or grocery store jobs and people without such privileges can‚Äôt afford to be as discriminate in their occupations morality. I suppose you could even say the same for things like the military/trading in intoxicants (sale of alcohol/drug trade) which primarily focuses its recruitment on lower class/younger people. Does karma take things like this into context? Does the situation of your life change how your karma affects you? If not, how can people justify a belief in something that chooses to ignore context and circumstances, as well as the cause and effect of their actions. Why does immediate experience trump all in regards to karma if its is supposed to be a result of your behavior, words, thoughts and actions?",Buddhism,1704656379.0,t3_1910esd,0.88,99

Can we discuss death?,"Hi everyone,

  I have been thoroughly immersed in studying dying for the last 9 years or so, and have been actively and rigorously training for dying for about 3-4 years.   During this stretch i have been in the hospital several time with extreme pain, illness, and/or discomfort.  The last time I was in the hospital in 2018 I contracted potentially fatal sepsis and was hospitalized for a full 30 days.  30 days in a hospital is not easy.

Of course, this inspired me to be even more determined to find a way to face my own death as peacefully and prepared as possible.  Training for dying has been a very rewarding, challenging, and inspiring journey.

I have learned that the best way for me to prepare is by putting aside one day off every week where I simulate that I going to die that day.  I don't just behave as if I'm going to die, I mentally put myself in the actual position that I am facing having to leave the body that day; which means 1) no distraction of any kind. 2) rigorous spiritual practice and preparation throughout the day. 3) every time I am tempted to pretend like it's a normal day, I don't take the bait and become slack or too relaxed.  4) I set aside 2 to 3 periods of actual death training during that day of death simulation; during these periods I practice meeting the moment of death.  This training is incredibly challenging and rigorous, like being in a crucible (at least for me).  During these periods of death training, I actively practice exactly how I resolve to face the moment of death and I do the specific mindfulness exercises and spiritual practices that I have studied and practiced, and I practice how I will attempt to leave my body (separate my consciousness from my body).  Then i practice exiting the body as I do my mindfulness/spiritual practices.  After a period of this training, I will go to my table and work with clay as a way of processing the emotions that come up, and also as a way of reintegrating/re-acclimating  my mind back into the world, and.gently easing my mind back into normalcy.  Death training/simulation takes an extraordinary amount of effort, resolve, and energy - and I have to do something in between death training sessions to not only put my mind on relaxing and edifying things, but also just wind my mind down from the very demanding training that is involved with preparing to die.

 I've been lucky that I've spent hundreds of hours training one on one with qualified Buddhist teachers over my 14 years of practicing Buddhism, so I've been exposed to a variety of practices and teachings that have helped me to find the right spiritual tools for me; as far as meditation, chanting, breathing, and teachings/principles I follow.   Nearing age 37, after a variety of serious health scares, this is absolutely the best time for me to be doing this - and this work can't wait.  

One of the most important things I've learned is the principle of gradual training, and this has helped me enormously in dying preparation/simulation.  Basically, you can't jump into the deep end if you haven't learned to swim; and even moreso, you won't be able to navigate the water well if you haven't developed your swimming strokes and at least practiced to make them as fundamentally sound/reliable as possible.  So it matters not only that we can swim, but that we learn to swim well also.  In this spirit, I have gradually, incrementally, and consistently increased my efforts and practices for death preparation over the last 3 years, usually about 10-20% more effort than the day before.  I have found that this is the way to make something as difficult as death manageable.  I have found that the best way to accomplish difficult things is to start with manageable, bite size pieces, and gradually increase the level of effort, energy, and discipline.  In this way, I began by doing thorough study of dying and dying preparation, especially with the aid of books like ""Deathing"" by Anya Foos Graber.   Then over a period of months and years, I began to actively practice death simulation and training by applying various mindfulness practices, through a series of trial and error to find what worked under the difficult conditions that death often involves.  I have had the opportunity to apply my practice during \[borderline\] horrific pain and discomfort.  Gradually, my practice has evolved into one that works for me, and undoubtedly it will continue to evolve.  

The most effective practices that are helping me now to train for dying are: 

1) the breathing practices presented by Ajahn Lee in his book ""Keeping the Breath in Mind"" :

Please share anything around dying and dying preparation that you think may benefit others.  This training is so worthwhile, because as we improve our ability to face death, everything in our life and spiritual journey gets easier.

"Buddhist ""self help"" is good but preliminary","Particularly in the west, where Buddhism is not the default but has to be actively sought out, it seems common for those interested in Buddhism to be seeking relief from various life challenges.  This makes perfect sense; Buddhism's central purpose is to allow relief from suffering.  But it appears that many westerners (myself included) are at least initially drawn to Buddhism not to pursue Buddhism's ultimate soteriological goal in earnest, but to have a better samsaric experience. Thus, we focus on things like how to let go of self-judgmental thoughts, how to be less angry or less anxious, or how to be kinder or to love more fully. Stuff like that.

These things are all important. Teachers like Thich Nhat Hanh have devoted thousands of hours of Dharma talks and thousands of pages of Dharma books on these exact subjects. I would never discourage any westerner interested in Buddhism from pursuing those sources. They are critical for laying the groundwork -- for facilitating the conditions under which deeper teachings may be successfully learned. Just, please keep in mind that Buddhist practice is intended to go far beyond these things.  Do not let yourself fall into the trap of being satisfied with a slightly better samsaric experience.  As Thich Nhat Hanh, himself, has explained:

>When we come to the practice we see a couple of Dharma doors that help us to feel relaxed and well. We like these practices very much and we master them in our daily life. Most of us are satisfied just to know how to breathe, survive, and smile, but we are not interested in going into the depths of Buddhism . . . to discover its most precious treasures. This cream of the Dharma is our true inheritance; with it, we can attain fearlessness, nirvƒÅ·πáa, and insight capable of snapping all of the ropes that bind us. That is the greatest aspiration of a practitioner. To be caught in our monastery, in our organization, in our particular group of friends‚Äîthe shared joys, sadness, and dreams‚Äîis a real waste.

>Therefore, to learn to transform our anger so that we can survive, smile, say a few kind words to another person, and be just a little less angry is good, but it is not our deepest aspiration. Our deepest aspiration is complete freedom. Therefore, we have to devote our lives to the practice with true determination. That is the heroic resolve we need to commit to in order to realize freedom.

Thich Nhat Hanh, *Cracking the Walnut: Understanding the Dialectics of Nagarjuna*, pp. 75-76.

If you are enjoying Thich Nhat Hanhs works about anger, fear, or love, or any of his many titles on these sorts of subjects -- or any similar works by other authors -- please consider progressing to deeper teachings when the time is right for you. Please consider adopting a formal practice as soon as you feel ready. Personally, I spent years ""messing around"" with Buddhist themed self-help before I decided to pursue deeper teachings, and I wish I had done so sooner. It is so much more effective to approach suffering from the root, and to seek to actually cure it, rather than wrestle with the largely symptomatic treatment of more generally applicable topics.

"Advice for a ""beginner"" is needed. What do you do when there are some days when the teachings you have interiorised just won't do?","Hello, first post on here. I've been learning about Buddhism for two years now, integrating it into my life as much as possible.

The teachings of Buddhism have helped me to live my life without suffering as much as I did before and I can only desire to carry on on my path and to get better.

However, there are some days when I wake up and I feel like nothing I've learnt works. This morning I've woken up with an anxiety attack and I haven't been able to eat at all during the day. I woke up hating my life (below the poverty line, my boyfriend is depressed, I live on the ground floor so I never get sunlight inside, hate my job and hate my city) and I wanted to just cry. 

I cried for a bit and then sat down and did some breathing exercises and went to the park to medidate. I am calmer now and trying to be compassionate with myself, thinking that I will bear it all better tomorrow, but I hate when it all crumbles.

sometimes i worry about doing buddhism wrong. feeling like i just want to do it the right way. i know there is no wrong or right in buddhism its just a feeling. but i believe this is really because i am from the west. where the religion is like a straight line.

Opinions on this?,"Hi my friends :)

I'm a teenager from Singapore and I haven't exactly fully decided which Buddhist sect to follow, though I am definitely leaning towards Tibetan Buddhism aka Vajrayana. It's just that something that perhaps transcends logic just feels right. Yk how they say how you don't choose your sect, it chooses you.

Anyhow, I'm thinking, the way the lotus sultra isn't really emphasised or included in the Tibetan canon, what are your opinions on say a tibetan buddhist reading the lotus sultra and somehow, somewhat finding wisdom in it and using it to advance further down the path.

Just thinking about the concept of reading sultras and on an individual level, deciding which one's to incoporate or emphasise in one's practice. Because I don't know, maybe a sultra isn't included in the canon of one's sect but if it helps one's buddhist practice, is it dharma? Perhaps the teaching isn't exactly those of Gautama Buddha himself but some monk or lama who was inspired by his teachings and produced a fine work that can help one down the path? I don't know.

&#x200B;

Also if a sultra isn't included in the canon of one's sect, say the tibetan canon, does that automatically make it invalid or false-dharma?

My Illustrated Dhammapada - 2.,"Greeting fellow travelers on the eightfold path!

It's been a while since my last post on this, but here is a continuation of my immersion in the Dhammapada.

***Intention shapes experiences***  
***intention is first, they‚Äôre made by intention***  
***If with pure intent***  
***you speak or act***  
***happiness follows you***  
***like a shadow that never leaves.***

&#x200B;

Peering deeply into this verse, I found that happiness isn't the only thing that follows you like a shadow:

***What goes with you,***  
***like a shadow that never leaves?***

***Both the good and the bad***  
***that a mortal does in this life***  
***is what they can call their own.***  
***That‚Äôs what they take when they go.***  
***That‚Äôs what goes with them,***  
***like a shadow that never leaves.***  
***That‚Äôs why you should do good,***  
***investing in the future life.***  
***The good deeds of sentient beings***  
***support them in the next world.***

Karma.  
Karma is your shadow, and it can be a shadow of happiness...or not.  
In the [B√∂n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bon) tradition, as well as certain schools of Tibetan Buddhism, the negative aspects of one's mind are faced head-on, so as to confront them and ""cut through"".  

Carl Jung also used what has been called ""shadow work"" to incorporate these negative aspects of the self.

&#x200B;

*‚ÄúOne does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious. The latter procedure, however, is disagreeable and therefore not popular.‚Äù* 

\- Carl Jung

&#x200B;

I believe this cuts right to the heart of the matter.  Do we ignore and attempt to purge ourselves of the evil aspects of our shadow, or do we face them and assimilate it?

What letting go looks like,"Hello all, my first post here. I have really been struggling with the concept of letting go and forgiving. Whether it‚Äôs people or events or things that remind me of things, I have found in the past 5 years at least since I‚Äôve cleaned up that I cannot for the life of me know and understand what it looks like to let go of things. I will tell people I forgive, and I like to trick myself into thinking the passage of time and forgetting is the same as forgiving and letting go. But it always reappears in trauma and the way I behave and treat those I say I love and I get really sad and hard on myself. I meditate daily and pray in the mind of gratitude but I struggle with the application a lot. I sometimes feel cursed or that karma is simply behaving as it should. I have not lived that good a life up until 2018. How do you let go and forgive and show those who harmed and wronged you love and humility? How do you forgive and live with less anxiety and fear?

Forgetting my thoughts as I focus on the breath,"Edit: I suppose the title should be: is it ok to deliberately keep track of my thoughts in meditation?

I do a basic meditation where I use body sensation as the object of meditation. I observe the sensations, usually in my torso, and the likely emotions that describe those sensations well. Thoughts, of course, are bubbling up all the time, sometimes sometimes I‚Äôm drawn to following a train of thought and do so, but as soon as I notice, I just note that I am thinking, and come back to my body. 

In tandem, I‚Äôm also doing some trauma therapy. Some aspects of this therapy benefits from self analysis, so nowadays when I meditate, I pause every few minutes, deliberately, and mentally catalog the sensations I was feeling and the types of thoughts that come up. When I‚Äôm confident I‚Äôll remember, I return to the meditation instructions.

Sometimes, I‚Äôm unconsciously drawn to also analyzing the relationship between the emotions and the thoughts while I‚Äôm in the meditation period, but I know this is ‚Äúbad‚Äù as I‚Äôm probably doing it to escape some uncomfortable feelings, since I‚Äôm doing it without intent. It‚Äôs more of a manifestation of monkey mind than conscious choice. So when I catch these types of thoughts I return to meditation.

After the meditation period, I try to analyze the patterns I observed, to find some insight or bring them into therapy to discuss with my therapist. it‚Äôs been a very helpful practice so far - for example, it helped me realize that my subconscious mind will spawn up infinite ways I could help people in my life, in response to me feeling discomfort about some interpersonal relationship. It‚Äôs got something to do with abandonment issues and people pleasing. 

My question is: from a Buddhist standpoint, is there anything unconventional or ‚Äúwrong‚Äù about having
1. A deliberate cataloging period in the meditation and 
2. Analyzing patterns post meditation to understand my conditioning better? The purpose of understanding my conditioning better is to make it easier for me to recognize when I‚Äôm being run by it in the future. There may be some other motivations too, but if there are, I either can‚Äôt verbalize them clearly or they‚Äôre subconscious.

"Faith, Practice, and Vows in Pure Land Buddhism",">You should know that the teaching of the Pure Land relies on the unfathomable strength of AmitƒÅbha Buddha's forty eight kind and compassionate vows, which embrace and accept all sentient beings in the ten directions.   
>  
>As long as beings possess a mind of faith, they will all be reborn there. Faith refers to faith in the existence of the Western Pure Land; faith that AmitƒÅbha Buddha embraces and accepts sentient beings. We sentient beings believe that we have the potential to be reborn in the Pure Land, and although it is said that AmitƒÅbha accepts sentient beings in rebirth, we must believe that this only manifests according to our minds as a response to our invocation and ultimately cannot be obtained externally. If one has faith in this, then one possesses true faith.   
>  
>However, faith without practice cannot be called true faith. Regarding practice, the *≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama S≈´tra* states, ""Restrain the Six Sense Organs and have pure thoughts without interruption. Without the use of expedient means, one's mind awakens on its own."" The *AmitƒÅbha S≈´tra* states, ""If there are virtuous men or virtuous women who hear others speak of AmitƒÅbha Buddha and hold fast to his name for one day, two days... up to seven days single-mindedly without distraction, then at the end of their lives, AmitƒÅbha Buddha and his sacred assembly will appear before them, and so, at the end of their lives, their minds will not have inverted views, and they will swiftly attain rebirth in AmitƒÅbha Buddha‚Äôs Land of Ultimate Bliss."" This kind of practice is called proper practice.   
>  
>However, without vows, practice will never be fully accomplished. Regarding vows, one must resonate with each and every one of AmitƒÅbha Buddha's forty eight vows, for these are the greatest vows. Faith, practice, and vows are like the three legs of a tripod; not one can be missing. Now, you should know that the very thought you have right now is inherently perfect and eternal. Faith, practice, and vows are the nature and virtue you originally possessed all along. Now, this is merely your inherent nature manifesting its radiance.

What is wrong with me? I still have $6000 credit cards debt that I need to pay off, and I am droolng over material possesions.

I havent made such purchases yet, because my goal is to pay off my credit card little by little... Its boring and painful to pay off my debt. Painful to see my hard earned money going back to the credit companies.

YouTube videos about buddhist wisdom helps in which they discuss about mindfulness and the art of letting go with non attachment and view things as impermanent.

But the feeling of ""wanting more"" keeps rushing into my mind.

"If there is no 'self', then who is attaining Nirvana?","Everything I have been through is not mine, it's just this entity feeling whatever it sees belong to it. I love someone and they leave me, I feel pain, I fall I feel pain, my loved ones die I feel pain. But when the same thing happen to someone else, I do sympathise but I don't feel the deep pain. This me is a collection of experiences. The people I know might have been with me for sometime so I may have got attached but at the end we are all some flesh, blood and bone. So everyone is the same way, there is no you or me. 

On the other hand if reincarnation is real, then there is a self or a collective self that is all me. It means my 'self' is divided into flames and going on to have different lives. I have been the king and the slave, the evil doer and the victim, the healer and the attacker. And I have been dividing into these 'flames' for eons. And people I know today are myself, making me cry, making me stand and taking care of me.

But then what is the point of reaching Nirvana? It's the place I believe I won't feel attached to self, and accept things as they are not of apathy but of wisdom. Does the 'flame' stops passing if I attain Nirvana? Also, is there any chance that Buddha means the ""flame"" as in off-spring?

How to practice Samata and vippasana meditation?,"Hi,
I am kind of confused with the two types of meditation, Samata and Vippasana.
With Samata meditation, you focus on your breathing (objects) and try to keep your awareness there. When you notice that you are not on the breathing you kindly come back to your breaths.
With Vippasana meditation, you observe your mind  and see them clearly. When a thought come, let it come and go and you can just observe that.
Do you practice both of them in the same one meditation session? Or can you practice them separately?

From a lot of guided meditations I listened to, I noticed you practice Samata first and then Vippasana. But when your mind gets calmer, guidance let you go back to Samata.

Opinion on Telling People to Find Teachers and Sangha,"First things first, if you have found a trustworthy teacher and/or a welcoming sangha, I rejoice for you! This post is not about how helpful having a teacher or sangha is. If you are not one of the people who urge others to find a teacher or sangha, you can safely ignore it.

Even with wholesome intentions, urging people to find a teacher or sangha, especially if they simply come here to ask questions, can build up a lot of pressure. I even witnessed a comment being downvoted simply because the person said that they currently had no teacher.

**Here's the issue**: depending on where you live, you either don't have a sangha that you can physically visit or the local 'sanghas' are run by exploitative groups that only use the label Buddhism as a deceptive front.  Sure, there are online sanghas, but there are also time zones, work days, responsibilities. Let alone sickness, disabilities, anxiety, trauma.

Usually, you don't know anything about the persons coming here, so please keep in mind that finding a teacher or sangha could be extremely difficult for them. Moreover, if you - after taking this into account - proceed to recommend that they find a sangha, **please** include links to the various lists of dangerous or exploitative cults, so that people know which groups to avoid. I will also look for some of them and post them as comment or edit.

Do I understand Buddhism?,"So I'm new to Buddhism, having been interested for many years but only recently started doing serious research. I've been reading and rereading about the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path, and I *think* I have an understanding of what's being said and how it applies to me personally, but I'd like some feedback.

So I'm a writer, have been all my life. I've written a number of original short stories and fanfiction, and my dream is to publish a novel someday. I love writing stories and putting them out in the world for others to read and enjoy. I particularly enjoy getting comments because I love hearing what people think of my writing. But sometimes that works against me: if I get little to no comments on a story it leaves me feeling discouraged and like the effort I put into writing didn't amount to anything.

So looking at this from a Buddhist perspective... I'm inviting suffering onto myself because I'm putting to much of my happiness on external forces, in this case being feedback from readers? And the way to avoid suffering is to stop putting so much emphasis on feeding my own ego and seeking validation from others?

Tired of life when things aren't working out,"



Some say just be positive or just take action then see what happens. If nothing happens just accept it and move on with life. It's like I try to do the right thing and try to fight for my justice and I'm here chasing there and here but I get no sort of help. I put trust and faith and try to be optimistic but nothing without at the end. I feel emotionally mentally exhausted like why do bad things keep happening in life and why do I always feel like every door I try to knock on just closes and closes. I don't know when things will work out and it's emotional wreck because you can't even feel enjoyment or any presence in current life when you are dealing with so many problems.

Breathing practices,"Hi all,

I have been deeply reflecting on how to best prepare for handling adversity such as serious illness, severe pain, and death.  I went to Thanissaro Bhikkhu's teachings for resources and found the story of his teacher's teacher Ajahn Lee, who successfully recovered from a heart attack by experimenting with the breath/prana - through trial and error.  He had watched holy men in India who could lay on beds of nails - and through insight he realized it was because they had mastered their breath.  He explains that mastering the breath is way more than just bringing awareness to the breath and following the in and out breath like in Shamata meditation.  It really has to do with qi/prana, as much as it has to do with breath.  If we find ourselves in times of severe pain or illness, we can potentially do this technique as a way to withstand adversity - this is one of the main objectives Ajahn Lee lays out.  Here is Ajahn Lee's book ""Keeping the Breath in Mind"" where he explains the techniques that worked for him: [https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/thai/lee/inmind.html](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/thai/lee/inmind.html)

Also, here is a talk by Thanissaro Bhikkhu where he discusses what he learned from Ajahn Lee's life and teachings: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czrSsT9wclc&t=9s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czrSsT9wclc&t=9s)

While learning about this method, I saw a post from a friend of mine on a private Buddhist discord channel where he showed a video about learning ki breathing, which is from Aikido.   I discovered that this is a great breathing technique for me to build my lower dan tian reservoir of qi, improve my health, and also to deepen my concentration and relaxation.  No method is right for everyone, but I have found this works well for me; I have been practicing ki breathing for approx 4 days.  I find it to be really helpful for strengthen my chi, calming my breath, and just leading to an overall feeling of well being.  One of the primary teachers of ki breathing, Kochi Tohei, writes: ""If on the occasion of some great incident you are agitated and unable to get a single good idea, resolutely practice ki breathing for about two hours, and you will be able to make up your mind, as new courage surges through you.""

Here is a youtube video that shows how to do the method:

Does Buddhism make you a calmer person?,"Oh dear, that's a terrible post title. Let me explain.

I'm looking into secular Buddhism. I don't yet know any other specifics. I understand that ""Buddhism"" is a catch-all term for a variety of practices.

I'm interested for many reasons, such as working diligently to cultivate a compassionate mindset. I expect to delve deeply into study, to be committed, and to try to live authentically. I don't expect this to be easy. I expect it to be a lifelong practice. I'd never stop learning and working on myself.

I'm wondering if it might make me less anxiety-ridden.

My PTSD controls my life. I'm constantly on edge. I can't escape my online trolls/abusers. They follow me from platform to platform. I can't control their bad behavior. All I can do is try to keep my anxiety, anger, and urges for retribution under control.

I don't see Buddhism as a fluffy feel-good escapist panacea. Quite the opposite.

I'm not expecting it to solve my problems. I'm not expecting it to heal my PTSD. All I'm hoping for is the ability to cope with my anxiety and my anger more effectively by cultivating a calmer way of thinking. (Mindfulness meditation isn't helpful. I have tried many, many different things.)

Would you say that your Buddhist practice has made you calmer, more peaceful? Is there anything else you'd like to add?

How does love work in to the Buddhist idea of peace?,"I have recently started to read more about Buddhism, but I am very early on in my journey and have a lot of questions and few answers! 
I started this path because I have recently found myself gripped by a very strong fear or anxiety about my death, and felt myself drawn towards Buddhist teachings as a source of comfort. 
Due to why I started seeking out new sources of wisdom, I've found myself reading a lot on meditating on your own death. I don't think I'm ready for it right now, as I think I need to be more calm first, but one part of that meditation that I have a hard time grasping/understanding/coming to terms with is the idea that my death anxiety comes from my worldly attachments, including my relationships. I have never had much draw towards material wealth, but I have a partner I love very much and who makes my life feel complete. If I want to accept my death, do I truly have to relinquish my relationships so I don't feel sorrow upon not having them when I die? 
How does one love something or someone without feeling regret/pain/loss when presented with the idea of it no longer being there?

Question about anatta and the 5 aggregates (+ clearing up misconceptions),"Yo Buddhists, I've got a question about a debate point between Hindu and Buddhist philosophy.

So basically, Buddhist teachings talk about there being no permanent, fixed self, which is the doctrine of *anattƒÅ*. At the same time, they describe our experience as being made up of five different aggregates, which is the *skandhas*.

But the Hindu Nyaya school had a *critique* here. Essentially ""If there's no eternal self, then what's actually combining and organizing these skandhas into a coherent experience? Shouldn't something be doing the bundling?"" *or more formally* ""The skandhas (form, feeling, perception, mental formations, consciousness) are described as the categories/aggregates that make up our experience of reality. However, for the skandhas to function as such (i.e. to be synthesized into a coherent experience), then wouldn't something need to perform that synthesis?""

I couldn't seem to find a direct response or rebuttal from any buddhist addressing this particularly. So can any of you Buddhist scholars help explain how y'all reconcile the skandhas with the lack of self? The best I can think of is that the nyaya simply assumes that there needs to be a self to do the bundling/synthesizing, or rather even if there were a self, that the self is permanent. Clearly, buddhists assert that the skandhas don't require a self after all. Looking forward to hearing your takes on this classic philosophical debate point.

For context; this was one of the papers I was reading - [https://core.ac.uk/download/7433921.pdf](https://core.ac.uk/download/7433921.pdf)

*Sidenote: I've been on a binge re-learning about buddhist ideas, and clearing up misconceptions. So far I've learned about upadanda, and the difference between tanhƒÅ and chanda attachments/desires. How sunyata doesn't necessarily mean that things doesn't exist per se, but rather it lacks actual substance/essence.*

Reality itself as an incomplete or distorted or to be more precise - an immaterial idea,"Long text wall ahead, please do read and share your comments. Have tried my best to express some jumbled thoughts. 

The way Buddhism approaches reality, the truth that one realizes eventually by following Dharma, let's assume this understanding itself is flawed, and one of the reasons being one's own subjective delusions. I mean it in the sense that there's no to verify until the wisdom dawns. The Buddhadharma path in general seems to suggest that by treading in the path one can achieve what was already evident to everyone; garbha.

I remember in Vasubandhu's works as to how he mentions that we cannot fathom what runs in the minds of the Buddhas and draws a clear distinction from our minds to make sense of why at a subjective level our minds are clouded. This is sensible, but the question that interests me is while following the path, it definitely feels like a certain leap of faith and blind acceptance is needed on the part of the seeker in considering the possibility of Buddha minds through deities of various forms that are nourishing us throughout this journey. And it's possible we may not even be receptive to these energies for most of our lives.

With this as background, isn't it better to rather refrain from this belief and only restrict oneself to what our understanding of reality is at that moment, and accept that reality itself is in some sense irrelevant? My surface level understanding of this idea feels like this avoids the Buddhist extremes, and so by not pursuing Buddhahood, the seeker is in a better position in the journey because he has less delusions to let go of eventually by not believing, and so whether a Buddha mind exists at all, actually free from ignorance - that notion itself is irrelevant.

The more one thinks in a positive manner and works by strictly adhering to practices, the more there is to let go, which might get difficult later on. Nagarjuna elaborates on this specific aspect in MMK if I recall accurately. In context to the two-truths, if I'm basing reality honestly and solely based on my subjective, relative experience, I am then mirroring an absolute that is actually full of defilements. This vision seems more beneficial because there is no additional burden on the seeker to further acknowledge realities that one can neither agree nor disagree with. Including the very wisdom one seeks.

Connecting back to the title - they are immaterial. So by not focusing on them, which are in a sense positive steps in Dharma, I'm avoiding the traps that may arise from them and so letting go of what I already know and have been gifted with in this life itself is already a big task, so this negative approach should suffice to realize that it is only through ignorance we are imagining either existence or non-existence and so there is literally nothing to fear or achieve or search besides what we are already witnessing - a fractured, broken perceived reality. What else could a Buddha know and do besides this? Nothing.

Thoughts on whether this falls on the two extremes or any insights at all would be much appreciated. I do not mean any disrespect to the Dharmas so if anything in this post comes across as so, forgive the missteps, they are mostly due to errors of expression.

Meditation would be great for them, but I was also hoping for the kids to learn the dharma as well, or at least have the option if they wanted to experience a full sangha session.

How can intention exist if anatta is true?,"In the Pali canon, the Buddha very clearly says an individual owns their own karma and that an individual should skillfully use intentions and ethical behavior to free themselves from all pain and stress.

I understand that the Buddha spoke using conventional language, but how can intention exist alongside anatta? If all we are is conditioned phenomena, processes like a verb rather than a noun, then how is it the conditioned phenemona can exert control over itself via intention?

Even granting that anatta has to be understood via practice and not semantic abstraction... I sometimes worry Buddhism isn't very logically sound on this ground. A lot of people struggle with anatta and rebirth, but the idea of a conditioned process or karmic stream transforming doesn't seem absurd to me. There not being an intender behind the intentions at the heart of the Buddhist practice, however, seems somewhat absurd.

I read a lot and I think overall, the buddhist mindset really adds wholesomeness to my life.

**However, the thing is this**:  I think of all the teachings solely as a guide to live life currently. I think karma (/kamma) is real,  and I can accept it based on the explanations by e.g. Alan Peto (who refers to Tich Nhat Hanh). Reincarnation, *not* rebirth based on previous actions.

I just cannot believe in anything supernatural, nothing beyond matter, our brain and this current life. 

* Conciousness? Just physics, chemistry, electricity. 
* A soul?  Nope, maybe some quantum physics happening in our brain.
* Existence before birth or after death? Not a thing imho.
* Gautama Buddha? Probably a really wise but normal human. I dont know.
* Enlightenment? Mostly officially reserved for monastics, a long-term goal. Maybe a bit overhyped.

So can I call myself a buddhist? I think buddhism certainly *is* a religion and without belief, I am not sure if I can really be a part of it. And I do believe, just that I belief in it as a guilde for a good life and not as a way to achieve enlightenment and become an Arhat or higher being afterwards. No cycle of rebirth, samsara, no past or future life, and no karma accumulation beyond this current existence. Yet I feel that this path is for me anyways.

I would not necessarily call myself an atheist either since I do follow buddhist teachings. But not as people that are not into the topic understand. So to those, I would for simplicity say that I am not religious, even though thats not actually really the case...

**TLDR**: I cannot belief in anything but this current existence. No supernatural beings, no soul, no existence after death. Yet I think the teachings are highly valuable. Can I still be a buddhist?

What do you think about the Madhyamika teachings of Buddhism?,"Hey folks,

&#x200B;

So for a while, I have been studying the Buddhist Madhyamika teachings (the Buddha, Nagarjuna, etc...), which is that of emptiness and dependent origination, and I find them to be quite incredible. To me, they are one of the best spiritual teachings out there. Seeing everything as empty, helps to decrease identification with, attachment to, as well as desire and grasping for, this world of form, names and dualities, namely the body-mind, which consists of the Five Aggregates. This, in turn, helps bring peace and happiness, and may eventually lead to the ""attainment"" of nirvana. What do you guys think of the Madhyamika teachings of Buddhism? Thanks.

&#x200B;

EDIT: If there are any pitfalls or downsides to this teaching, please let me know as well. Thanks.",Buddhism,1704465160.0,t3_18z88tm,0.92,11
Books,Are there any book recommendations you have for dealing with perfectionism and anxiety?,Buddhism,1704489281.0,t3_18zhsub,1.0,3
"Amitabha will always say these three sentences: ‚ÄòMy love, you will always be treasured. You are unable to commit any mistakes. Do not be frightened.‚Äô","
So, when we talk about love, we must first learn to love ourselves. The problem with us is we do not have such ability to love ourselves. But luckily Amitabha Buddha has this power, this ability. So how to love ourselves? We start by feeling the love of Amitabha Buddha. There are three stages.

Firstly, we must listen to the Dharma. The dharma love arises from the Dharma. What is the function of listening to the dharma? The first is to feel the love of Amitabha Buddha. Secondly is to receive and accept the love of Amitabha Buddha. Next is to enjoy the love of Amitabha Buddha.

When you are touched by a dharma talk, this is feeling. You think, ‚ÄòOh, I do not realize Amitabha Buddha loves me so much. He does not impose any conditions. He just wants to rescue me to the World of Ultimate Bliss in the West.‚Äô

So, our dharma door is the door of great protection. It does not matter how terrible you are, how ungrateful you are, how hopeless you are, how stupid you are, how sinful you can be, but if you can recite the Buddha Name, Amitabha will guarantee your attainment of Buddhahood in the Western World of Ultimate Bliss. Amitabha will always say these three sentences:

‚ÄòMy love, you will always be treasured. You are unable to commit any mistakes. Do not be frightened.‚Äô

Amitabha Buddha who loves us will rescue us without setting any conditions. On listening to the Dharma and if we are able to penetrate the thorough love, the ultimately perfect love of the Buddha, we will surely be touched. We will receive and accept His Love. We will be totally subdued when we enjoy the Buddha‚Äôs love for us. After this we can promote this love to others.

SoÔºå the first thing we must learn is to start loving oneself. How do you know if we love ourselves or not? Firstly, check for yourself,

‚ÄòAre you happy?‚Äô ‚ÄìHappy

‚ÄòAre you glad?‚Äô‚Äì we are glad.

‚ÄòYou should be able to laugh!‚Äô‚ÄìHa ha ha

The main point here is to be happy. It does not matter if a man is put into jail. But if his mind is kept in the prison, he is truly jailed. When we are happy and people lock us up in the room, how can they make us unhappy? Happily, you pronounce, ‚ÄòNever mind, it does not matter if you were to lock me in the room.‚Äô I am still happy, right? If you are unhappy, what is the point if you were to go on a tour? Your eye-brows are all locked up. A happy man will not lock up his eye-brows as he is relaxed and comfortable. SoÔºå you must know your two eye-brows are the gate of your house. People take a look at you and they will know your gate is locked.

Happiness resembles the opening of a flower. In the Chinese sayings it is thus stated,

‚ÄòThe flowers of the mind are flourishing.‚Äô

If a flower does not open, there is no fragrance, there is no fruits. How can a flower show its beauty if it does not open up?

In the same way, when our mind flower does not open up in happiness, it cannot reveal the beauty of Buddha recitation.

When our mind flower does not open up, there is no fragrance of Buddha recitation. When our mind flower does not open up it is difficult to reap the fruit of Buddhahood. We must know the opening of the flower is the same as the opening up of a joyful mind flower.

Lie to help another person?,"So this may be a very dumb question from a beginner, sorry in advance.

Recently I came upon the situation that a friend of mine went to rehab because of his alcoholism.
After his release date being announced his GF wanted to buy some stuff and since she had no way of transport I went shopping instead and she sent me a list.

The list contained normal stuff, food, etc but also a specific alcoholic drink, which I know she literally never drinks because she doesn't like the taste. After asking her why it's on the list she answered it's only for her but as I said, she never drinks it.

Because of my suspicions I lied after shopping and told her the store was out of the specific drink. My thinking is she wanted to do something good to her BF and buy it because he likes it and she wants to make him happy, however I don't think it would be a good decision because he's a recovering alcoholic. Mind you, she's also alcoholic so I think here judgement is kind of biased.

Was I in the right to lie here and tell her the store was out of the drink she put on the list? It wasn't, but if I had bought it I'd feel really bad about it, knowing my friend would probably start drinking it again. The end of the story is, she went herself a day later and bought it anyway, but I just couldn't do it because I know it would hurt him again in the long run as a recovering alcoholic.

I know I shouldn't lie, but what if it's helping another person? My intention is good I guess, but I still lied which is bad. Did I put my own desires above theirs? I'm kind of feeling bad for lying but buying it would make me feel even worse.

My question can probably be extended in general, is it ok to do a bad thing now if the result is something good in the long run? How would my karma be affected if I genuinely try to help and do something bad like lying so the end result will be good?",Buddhism,1704450405.0,t3_18z3s9c,0.92,10

Looking for response to Pope John Paul II's take on Buddhism,"So im reading ""Crossing the Threshold of Hope"" by Pope John Paul II. There is a section where he compares Catholicsism to other major world religions. I found his perspective on buddishm to be lacking, and would like a informed counter argument to his main point.   


>The Buddhist doctrine of salvation constitutes the central point, or  rather the only point, of this system. Nevertheless, both the Buddhist  tradition and the methods deriving from it have an almost exclusive  negative soteriology. The ""enlightenment"" experienced by Buddha comes  down to the conviction that the world is bad, that it is the source of  evil and of suffering for man. To liberate oneself from this evil, one  must free oneself from this world, necessitating a break with the ties  that join us to external realities existing in our human nature, in our  psyche, in our bodies. The more we are liberated from these ties, the  more we become indifferent to what is in the world, and the more we are  freed from suffering, from the evil that has its source in the world. Do  we draw near to God in this way? This is not mentioned in the  ""enlightenment"" conveyed by Buddha.  
Buddhism is in large measure an  ""atheistic"" system. We do not free ourselves from evil through the good  which comes from God; we liberate ourselves only through detachment from  the world, which is bad. The fullness of such a detachment is not union  with God, but what is called nirvana, a state of perfect indifference  with regard to the world. To save oneself means, above all, to free  oneself from evil by becoming indifferent to the world, which is the  source of evil. This is the culmination of the spiritual process. At  various times, attempts to link this method with the Christian mystics  have been made - whether it is with those from northern Europe (Eckhart.  Tauler, Suso, Ruysbroeck) or the later Spanish mystics (Saint Teresa of  Avila, Saint John of the Cross). But when Saint John of the Cross, in  the Ascent of Mount Garmel and in the Dark Night of the Soul, speaks of  the need for purification, for detachment from the world of the senses,  he does not conceive of that detachment as an end in itself. ""To arrive  at what now you do not enjoy, you must go where you do not en joy. To  reach what you do not know, you must go where you do not know. To come  into possession of what you do not have, you must go where now you have  nothing"" (Ascent of Mount Carmel, i, 13, ii).

There are a few fundamental assumptions here that I feel are incorrect: 

1. The ""enlightenment"" experienced by Buddha comes  down to the conviction that the world is bad, that it is the source of  evil and of suffering for man.
2.  we liberate ourselves only through detachment from  the world, which is bad
3. what is called nirvana, a state of perfect indifference  with regard to the world
4. To save oneself means, above all, to free  oneself from evil by becoming indifferent to the world

What would be a proper Buddhist response to this? My understanding is that Nirvana/Enlightenment is not about becoming indifferent to the world, but rather a full awareness of the fundamental reality of the world. 

Is my understanding correct? What Buddhist texts would you use to support/refute the Popes argument here.

How to further implement the Dharma into my life?,"For some context, I'm 17 years old and live in the Southern United States's ""bible belt."" I come from a Christian family so I practice Buddhism in private. I don't go to a temple or have a teacher as I'm waiting until I move out and can freely practice my religion without my family's knowledge. So being without a teacher and living in a largely Christian culture, I sometimes have trouble implementing the teachings that I learn about and meditate on.

I've been meditating on equanimity in love and compassion recently, and the meditations have helped a lot. I got the specific meditation that I've been doing for the past couple days from H.H. The Dalai Lama's *Library of Wisdom and Compassion Vol. 1.*

1. Basically I develop a sense that others are kind through remembering their kindness to me, as well as thinking about how even people with ""disruptive"" actions have been so kind as to challenge me to learn forgiveness and patience to help further me along my spiritual path. I think about the infinite past lives and the ways in which all beings have crossed my path in one way or another and been kind to me.
2. I then visualize many different people experiencing kindness as well as extending a wish for them to experience kindness. I start with a few people then spread this to all sentient beings.
3. I then visualize many people being free from suffering and I extend a wish for all beings to be liberated from suffering. I develop a desire to help free all beings from suffering.
4. I then think about all three of these topics in conjunction with each other. i feel a desire to be kind to all beings and to help all beings so that they may be liberated from suffering. I feel a need to take my spirituality seriously so that I may reach buddhahood and help others reach buddhahood as well. I wish to generate good karma so that I can be better prepared to help others.

This meditation works extremely well for me and I go into the day feeling balanced and a sense of compassion for all beings, however, this feeling leaves me once I get started with my day and become preoccupied with school work and other things. I notice myself developing destructive emotions throughout the day such as anger and judgement and don't often end the day feeling good about the things I did, said, and thought. I was wondering if there's anything I can do throughout my day to remind myself of the Buddha's teachings so that I can further implement them? I consider myself very dedicated; lots of my free time is spent learning about Buddhism and practicing Buddhism, I just find trouble remembering to implement the things that I've learned and meditated on while I go about my daily activities.

Beginner here: I‚Äôm feeling conflicted about choosing between Theravada and Mahayana,"Hello all! I‚Äôve recently been getting into Buddhism and have been trying to study some of it each day. Today I was struggling with differentiating the multiple schools of Buddhism but ultimately think I understand the key differences between the traditions. If my understanding is correct in the simplest way I can think to explain it Theravada is the path of reaching enlightenment in this life and stopping rebirth and Mahayana is taking the path to enlighten all beings before ultimately reaching your own nirvana. In my head now *somewhat* understanding the two main schools I feel more aligned with Theravada but apart of me feels bad for picking it over Mahayana. I feel like it would be selfish of me to chose to focus on my enlightenment rather than caring about the rest of the worlds enlightenment as well.

Difference between an Arhat and a Buddha,"(Quick background to put my viewpoint into context: raised skeptical agnostic in the west. Skeptical of most things by nature. Had my ¬º life existential crisis about the ""point of it all"" and am trying to lean more into spirituality and Theravada Buddhism has sparked the most interest. Got a lot to learn but have a somewhat decent comprehension of the core doctrine (4 nbl truths, nbl 8 fold path, anatta, dependent origination, kamma, rebirth etc))

Recently I've been listening to a series of talks by Bikkhu Bodhi introducing Buddhism which he states the functional difference between a Buddha and an Arhat is that a Buddha rediscovers the Dharma after it has been forgotten and attains enlightenment out of their own effort, while an Arhat follows the Dharma taught by the Buddha of their Kalpa and attains enlightenment through the following of the teachings. Both are enlightened, the distinction is based on how they got there.

This sparked my curiosity and did a bit of searching to see if there are any Arhats alive today. This lead me down a chain to find an argument made that an Arhat cannot recognise the Arhatship of another (i.e both are enlightened and will try to teach one another as they cannot see that either one has already realised Nibbana).

But a Buddha can see if a being is enlightened. 

To me this doesnt add up and seems like a logical fallacy. If the distinction between a Buddha and an Arhat is based on if they discovered the Dharma or not then there wouldn't be a difference between their abilities to recognise other enlightened beings...right?

I appreciate I'm likely missing something here, or have made some assumptions. Right now it's not adding up, if you could point me in the right direction to overcome this problem I'd be extremely grateful!",Buddhism,1704446613.0,t3_18z2uuv,0.5,0

# What Does ""Non-self"" Mean in Buddhism?

*A Hopefully Accessible Explainer*

[Paro Taktsang Temple in the Himalayas. Credits to Sam Power via Unsplash.](https://preview.redd.it/zrvdepenbhac1.jpg?width=4286&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5d533f9ebc747277f3c8958244d51308ce076ce0)

# Explained Conceptually

To explain non-self, one must do so with the proper context. Let‚Äôs start with my paraphrased version of the Buddha‚Äôs first teaching:

1. All beings are conditioned to suffer.
2. The root cause of suffering is clinging.
3. We can end our suffering by letting go of clinging.
4. The way to let go of clinging is by following the [Eightfold Path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path).

These points above are known as the [Four Noble Truths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Noble_Truths)  (I will gloss over the Eightfold Path for now as it deserves its own blog post). So as the Buddha stated, the key to ending our suffering is by letting go of clinging. So what is clinging? Clinging refers to the felt sense of wanting to get the things we currently do not have and wanting to keep the things we currently do have.

We must also explain the idea of self. When the Buddha talked about the self, he usually talked about it in the context of ‚Äú[I-making‚Äù and ‚Äúmy-making](https://tricycle.org/magazine/there-no-self/).‚Äù  These refer to the mental process of us defining all things through this dualistic lens either being me/mine or not being me/mine. For example, we may notice thoughts like ‚ÄúI am my body, I am an American, this my family, this is my property,‚Äù etc.

In this context, we can think of non-self as the process of gradually feeling less clinging to the things that we previously, maybe very strongly, identified with. And as we loosen this clinging, we can gradually reduce our suffering as well.

# Explained Experientially

As I have gradually deepened my understanding of non-self, I have noticed my mind incline towards less suffering in the following ways. Please note that I am still fairly new to the path (only around a year in), so I still have a long way to go in cultivating a more comprehensive understanding of non-self. 

## Less Identification

&#x200B;

[Credits to DALL‚Ä¢E.](https://preview.redd.it/rrot59subhac1.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9ffcda7f76c2a06e31cde2e063c89b946d28538)

I now feel far less identified with things that I used to very strongly identify with. For example, as a 5‚Äô 5‚Äù man based in New York City, I used to feel very insecure about my height. For context, the average height of men in NYC is 5‚Äô10‚Äù. I would regularly be stressed about how all the cards were stacked against me, especially in a dating context, because women, on average, seem to prefer taller men. I  remember also frequenting the [r/short](https://www.reddit.com/r/short/) subreddit, where I would commiserate with my fellow short humans. 

What really drove the nail in the coffin was sometimes seeing people on the subreddit who were a few inches taller than me still complaining about how short they were. If even they don‚Äôt have a chance, then what hope do I have? I strongly believed that because I was short, I was doomed to be single forever, and if I couldn‚Äôt get a girlfriend, then I was doomed to die alone, so I would never be truly happy. These were the kinds of stories I would tell myself and fully believe.

It feels so fascinating to reminisce about some of the mental states that used to be present in my mind. Regardless, I am grateful to say that now, around a year later, I rarely, if ever, think about my height at all. After making some progress on the path, I have come to more clearly see that happiness is something that does come from within and that while things like our height, weight, wealth, job, love life, etc., can be things that pull our attention away from this inner happiness, they can never  extinguish it.

## Less Value Judgements

Another way non-self has helped reduce my suffering is by allowing me to feel like events in my life are not inherently good or bad. The channel Pursuit of Wonder has a great six-minute YouTube video explaining this concept. I encourage you to watch it:

[https://youtu.be/oGVhOWqsBWM](https://youtu.be/oGVhOWqsBWM)

In essence, this is tied to this other idea known as [emptiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A%C5%ABnyat%C4%81). Emptiness states that no thing is inherently anything. This is best exemplified by sayings like [one man‚Äôs trash is another man‚Äôs treasure](https://usdictionary.com/idioms/one-mans-trash-is-another-mans-treasure/), or that [beauty is in the eye of the beholder](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/beauty-is-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder).

I was very grateful to have an embodied understanding of this concept when I was let go from my job earlier this month. Admittedly, the news was not so surprising as I was on a performance improvement plan (PIP)  for two months prior (for those of you unaware, PIPs are sometimes used as a formality before letting someone go as opposed to being a plan of action to help an employee improve their performance). Regardless, I did feel quite devastated. While I cannot say I was deeply passionate about my last job, I can say it was a rather good job that I was very grateful to have had.

[Credits to DALL‚Ä¢E.](https://preview.redd.it/rmc7nhd7chac1.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c3b832c28d5abd31727b7146b333c5401af0a45)

Anyway, it felt beautiful to notice how, despite this troubling news, I have felt mostly peaceful. There have even been times when I have felt quite optimistic about the future. I think about how this  challenging life event has the potential to be looked back upon as a turning point that led to greater things. 

I will not deny that there have been times when I have felt some stress about the uncertainty of the future. But overall, I would say that I see this event as largely neutral. I think I‚Äôll need to wait a few years to see how my life unfolds to get a true sense of whether this event resulted in my life going in a more skillful or less skillful direction. Admittedly, even at that point, I cannot know for sure.

## Less Separation

Let‚Äôs say we take this idea of emptiness a step further. As I mentioned  earlier, no thing is inherently anything; this applies not only to objects and events but also to living beings. Furthermore, this not only applies in terms of value judgments (pleasant, neutral, unpleasant) but also concepts generally. What do I mean by this?

Let‚Äôs take a dog, for example. What exactly is a dog? A dog is just a label that we have given to a certain group of animals that fit a certain set of criteria. If there were no humans, there would be no concept of dogs. Obviously, the subset of animals that the label dog refers to would still exist, but the concept itself would not. The concept only exists in our minds.

[While the concept of dogs is subjective, their cuteness is objective üòç. Credits to Maksym Tymchyk via Unsplash.](https://preview.redd.it/sf8avkbechac1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d6962220513a605f2ec636b4d3939f7d5955a049)

Now let‚Äôs take this another step further: Humans. The idea of emptiness can be used to understand ourselves as well. These labels we give ourselves of Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jew, and Muslim are all  concepts that exist only in our minds. While these labels can be a great  source of community, belonging, and identity, they also, by definition, are a source of separation. And it is with this foundation of separation that we can fuel narratives of ‚Äúus‚Äù vs. ‚Äúthem‚Äù and justify inflicting large amounts of suffering to our fellow humans.

While I have previously heard these ideas of ‚Äúeverything is connected‚Äù and ‚Äúwe‚Äôre all one,‚Äù I just viewed them as something a hippie would say while they‚Äôre high. I never realized that this could be a more accurate picture of reality.

This past year was likely one of the most difficult years of my life in terms of my mental health. During  this time, I was quite desperate in searching for and trying out a variety of healing modalities. One of the methods I tried was a [silent meditation retreat](https://www.dharma.org/retreats/faqs/). 

During a retreat, one alternates between sitting and [walking meditation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking_meditation)  all day. The main breaks from meditation are meals and a daily lecture about Buddhist teachings. Also, the entire retreat is in silence,  meaning there is no talking outside of asking teachers questions. They also firmly recommend not reading, writing, using electronics, or even looking at others. Retreats can be as short as half a day or as long as months or years. So far, the longest retreat I have done is a week, though I hope to someday do a [three-month retreat](https://www.dharma.org/retreats/forest-refuge/). 

I found my retreats very helpful, and during one of them, I specifically  went in with the intention of gaining a deeper understanding of non-self. During that retreat, I had this peculiar yet powerful insight of seeing all of life as if it were one of those facial cleanser bottles with those exfoliating beads.

[Credits to DALL‚Ä¢E.](https://preview.redd.it/far98czjchac1.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=975dea4365eb163fffe2a6162b30df8ef7b26e51)

Just as a bottle of facial cleanser with beads has them suspended in these somewhat random clusters, some relatively dense while others rather sparse, so too is all of existence. I have come to see that the  whole universe is in many ways a large collection of particles that happens to be more densely clustered in certain patterns in some areas and more loosely clustered in different patterns in other areas. These patterns and clusters, by themselves, are completely neutral without any concepts. It is we humans, sometimes for better and sometimes for worse, who decide to add labels to these patterns. And it is when we take these concepts too seriously and identify with them too strongly that we suffer.

It feels beautiful to have a deeper, more embodied sense of the interconnectedness of all existence. I think it has made me a kinder person than before, and I hope that as I deepen my understanding of this idea, my mind‚Äôs inclination toward kindness will also continue to deepen. It‚Äôs also pretty cool how the most mundane things can teach us fundamental features of the universe.

# Knowledge vs. Wisdom

>And‚Äîthus is my thought, oh exalted one,‚Äînobody will obtain salvation by means of  teachings! You will not be able to convey and say to anybody, oh venerable one, in words and through teachings what has happened to you in the hour of enlightenment! The teachings of the enlightened Buddha contain much, it teaches many to live righteously, to avoid evil. But there is one thing which these so clear, these so venerable teachings do not contain: **they do not contain the mystery of what the exalted one has experienced for himself**, he alone among hundreds of thousands.

[Credits to DALL‚Ä¢E.](https://preview.redd.it/zqhyhkcuchac1.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=8362006c3c5682043efebf4796a43b475db9c581)

Now that I have finished sharing my thoughts on non-self, I would like to distinguish between knowledge and wisdom. The excerpt above is from the amazing novel [*Siddhartha*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_(novel))  by Herman Hesse. In this moment, our protagonist, Siddhartha, is having a conversation with the Buddha named Gotama. By the way, ‚ÄúBuddha‚Äù is a title meaning ‚Äúthe awakened one.‚Äù

*Side note: Some of  you may know that the real-life Buddha‚Äôs name was Siddhartha Gautama, so this may be somewhat confusing. To clarify, in the novel, the novel version of Siddhartha is merely someone completely unrelated to the novel version or real-life Buddha while the novel version of the Buddha is based on the real-life Buddha.*

In this quote, Siddhartha is in essence saying that while he fully agrees with the Buddha‚Äôs teachings, he does not wish to become his follower. This is because no matter how amazing the teachings may be, they are, at the end of the day, just that, teachings, i.e., knowledge. What Siddhartha says he really wants is the direct experience that those teachings spring from, i.e., wisdom.

To further drive the point home, imagine you want to learn a new skill, let‚Äôs say, how to successfully run a business. To learn this new skill, one can watch YouTube tutorials, read books, hire a coach, or even go to business school. All of these things can be quite valuable, but can only impart knowledge. Only through the direct experience of starting a business and trying to run it can one accrue the wisdom of how to run a business successfully.

So where am I going with all this? I believe you should see this post and anything outside your direct experience as ‚Äúknowledge.‚Äù To understand non-self (or anything else in life) more deeply, I encourage you to consider testing the idea for yourself. In the context of Buddhist ideas like non-self, the best lab would be meditation (in particular, a silent retreat!). The Buddha himself said not to take anything he or others say at face value and instead determine for yourself through your own contemplation what is and is not true^(1).

# Conclusion and an Invitation

Thank you for reading my blog! Feel free to let me know any comments, questions, or feedback you have! I am very new to blogging, so any input you have would be greatly appreciated üòä.

Although I mentioned earlier that direct experience is best, that does not mean knowledge does not help! With that in mind, I invite you to schedule a [free meditation teaching session](https://calendly.com/adityaaswani/one-on-one-meditation-teaching)  with me on Calendly! üòÑ To be clear, I am not currently a teacher! As mentioned before, I am fairly new to the path, with only around a year of focused practice. Regardless, I can provide helpful guidance for people who consider themselves absolute beginners.

Also, as I would like to become a proper teacher someday, I see these sessions as an opportunity for me to learn how to teach. As such, these sessions will be free for the foreseeable future. I want to ensure that I have much more experience before switching to a donation-based ([Dana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C4%81na)) or sliding-scale model later on.

Of course, if you are looking for a more experienced teacher, I encourage you to do that! I personally had a teacher I met with once a week for about a year to help guide me through my practice, and I can say I found it immensely beneficial.

Anyway, thank you again for reading my blog and considering my invitation! Sending [metta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maitr%C4%AB) ‚ù§Ô∏è.

Looking for audio chant recomendations,"I was watching a tsok ceremony this morning and one of my dogs became extremely interested in the chanting, which is very unusual.

"The Buddha then spoke to Subhuti: ‚ÄúAll that has a form is illusive and unreal. When you see that all forms are illusive and unreal, then you will begin to perceive your true Buddha nature.‚Äù","Namo Amituofo üôèüèª

„ÄäDiamond Sutra„Äã:

‚ÄúBy detachment from appearances-abiding in Real Truth. -So I tell you-

Thus shall you think of all this fleeting world:

A star at dawn, a bubble in a stream;

A flash of lightening in a summer cloud,

A flickering lamp, a phantom, and a dream.‚Äù

Master Da'an:

The Pure Land Dharma requires us to recite Amitabha Buddha's name, and establish a body image of Amitabha Buddha; it establishes the majesty of the Western Pure Land; and it requires us to seek rebirth in the direction of the Pure Land. It seems that there is a contradiction in what the Diamond Sutra says, but it appears to be contradictory, but in fact it is not contradictory.

They are both perfect interpenetration and mutual inclusion. One is from the level of True Realm of Reality. The level of True Realm of Reality is to sweep away everything without establishing a single speck of dust. One is from the perspective of secular truth, it establishes everything. In the Diamond Sutra, Prajna emptiness enters from the teaching of emptiness, so it must sweep away all forms; the Pure Land Dharma is implemented from the teaching that acknowledges the existence of characteristics, and this Dharma must establish the phase. But this phase is not the phase of our sentient being‚Äôs karma. It is the phase that appears from the pure heart and merits of Amitabha Buddha, and it is the marvelous existence that arises from the true emptiness. This marvelous existence is equivalent to true emptiness, and the marvelous existence of true emptiness is two sides of one body. This is called ""the marvelous phenomena state of the ultimate truth"". Therefore, through such a marvelous existence, one can enter into the Dharmakaya Tathagata, which is the ""embodiment of truth"".

Therefore, the convenience of the Pure Land method lies in ""pointing to the direction to establish the form, and living in the form to realize the Buddhahood."" Instruct the Western Pure Land to establish the appearance of Amitabha's form and sound, the appearance of good images, and the appearances of the Paradise of Ultimate Bliss, which is upright and solemn. These sounds, Amitabha's name, and the upright and solemn state of the Paradise are all manifestations of reality. Therefore, by living in this phase, you can realize the fruit of reality. This is why the facilities of the Dharma are different, but they are the same at home.",Buddhism,1704335788.0,t3_18y1xof,0.87,15

Newish to Buddhism and came up with this question recently.,"So given that Siddhartha was born and achieved ‚ÄúBuddahood‚Äù or Nirvana in roughly the year 500 BCE.

And given that Nirvana is the path to end all suffering, for all beings, everywhere.

How do current Buddhists reconcile the fact that the amount of suffering since Buddha‚Äôs passing has only increased in our world?

And that it has increased exponentially within the last 100 years or so, and in my own personal perspective shows no signs of stopping or even slowing.

Why is suffering increasing exponentially if Siddhartha and other Buddhist practitioners have reached enlightenment and therefore know the way to end all suffering, for all beings, everywhere?

Dream of praying in a Buddhist Temple,"Starting the dream, I was a victim of an alien testing at some random facility, they were testing energy directed weapons on human subject. I was a one of the test subjects. It really hurt once functional. This entire part of fa dream was really, really dark. I looked directly in their eyes and laughed at their faces the whole time as if to show I have no fear towards them, the testing hurt in certain areas. They weren't the aliens we depict. Imagine an octopus in like walking/floating humanoid form and a rope. They took me away, I spat at the alien, closed my eyes and woke up standing in the corner of a temple.

It was a Buddhist temple, everything started to get weird the second I looked straight ahead, weird pictures showing up, there was this guy in other corner, the entire person was a silhouette and it felt like he was ready to do some very bad stuff. I felt it in my bones, so I launched and went straight at him to fight him and then I got stopped by this elder monk, very calm, without words told me to get on my knees and pray with him instead. So I prayed with him.

He was quiet and all those negative things slowly went away for good, strange creepy guy included (he was screaming his lungs out), everything felt comfortingly violent around while it was happening, but I had my eyes closed, on my knees just praying. He disappeared and then the temple started to crumble slowly and disappear top to bottom and me with it, but the entire violent part around me while being still in my prayer felt almost therapeutic in a way and then I woke up.

For like solid hour everything around me did not feel very real. I feel like I was still somewhere else still stuck. I'm not considering myself religious (I grew up christian), but it was a very real dream and it was very obviously a dream, and I don't know if it has any meaning, but I wanted to share this experience with people who practice this religion and know ins and outs. How our brains can construct such experiences is absolutely wild and I wondered about what it might mean if it really means anything.

Four Modes of Samadhi,"[AN 4.41](https://suttacentral.net/an4.41)

‚ÄúMonks, these are the four developments of concentration. Which four? There is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to a pleasant abiding in the here & now. There is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to the attainment of knowledge & vision. There is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to mindfulness & alertness. There is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to the ending of the effluents.

And what is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to a pleasant abiding in the here & now? There is the case where a monk‚Äîquite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful qualities‚Äîenters & remains in the first jhana: rapture & pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation. With the stilling of directed thoughts & evaluations, he enters & remains in the second jhana: rapture & pleasure born of composure, unification of awareness free from directed thought & evaluation‚Äîinternal assurance. With the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, & alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters & remains in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, ‚ÄòEquanimous & mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.‚Äô With the abandoning of pleasure & pain‚Äîas with the earlier disappearance of elation & distress‚Äîhe enters & remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity & mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. This is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to a pleasant abiding in the here & now.

And what is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to the attainment of knowledge & vision? There is the case where a monk attends to the perception of light and is resolved on the perception of daytime [at any hour of the day]. Day [for him] is the same as night, night is the same as day. By means of an awareness open & unhampered, he develops a brightened mind. This is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to the attainment of knowledge & vision.

And what is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to mindfulness & alertness? There is the case where feelings are known to the monk as they arise, known as they persist, known as they subside. Perceptions are known to him as they arise, known as they persist, known as they subside. Thoughts are known to him as they arise, known as they persist, known as they subside. This is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to mindfulness & alertness.

And what is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to the ending of the effluents? There is the case where a monk remains focused on arising & falling away with reference to the five clinging-aggregates: ‚ÄòSuch is form, such its origination, such its passing away. Such is feeling, such its origination, such its passing away. Such is perception, such its origination, such its passing away. Such are fabrications, such their origination, such their passing away. Such is consciousness, such its origination, such its disappearance.‚Äô This is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to the ending of the effluents.

These are the four developments of concentration.

And it was in connection with this that I stated in Punnaka‚Äôs Question in the [Way to the Far Shore](https://suttacentral.net/snp-parayanavagga):

‚ÄòHe who has fathomed

for whom there is nothing
perturbing in the world‚Äî
his vices evaporated,
undesiring, untroubled,
at peace‚Äî
he, I tell you, has crossed over birth

So Grateful,"Idk where else to put this but the more i read the Dharma the more i am just filled with joy for real. I discovered Buddhism at a very young age in a normal history class. My teachers was one of the only ones qualified to teach religion funny enough. He explained every major world religion and even though I was raised in a STRICT Christian household, Buddhism caught my eye. I began to study it and read the sutras and it wasn‚Äôt until about three years later when i really could say that i started to make an attempt to follow the precepts and meditate daily. I would do acts of generosity almost everyday for my parents and meditate in nature on the swing that was in my backyard, surrounded by trees. It was the most peaceful summer ever i swear and everytime i breathed i felt the wind blow through the trees like we were breathing together. I was far too young to really understand the essence of what the Dharma teaches though, so eventually as i got older and filled with more worldly responsibilities i strayed terribly. I‚Äôm just returning from a service trip to Africa and I felt instantly reconnected with the practice. I began to study and read again and it‚Äôs so much sweeter being that I‚Äôm at an age where I can truly comprehend just how wise the Tathagata really is. So graceful with words and so logical, the Dharma truly saved me. Where I‚Äôm located it‚Äôs not very common to practice Buddhism either so I often get questions from friends. I recently sat down and explained my beliefs to one of my best friends with no intention of swaying his mind just to answer his questions but i think i may have converted him on accident üò≠ He was so amazed at how logical and peaceful it is and how he was able to apply it to every area of his life. I felt so blessed to be able to share the Buddha‚Äôs wisdom. How beautiful is the doctrine that all who hear it are instantly moved! ü•πI continue to practice in secret because it would be a huge risk in my family. I wish I didn‚Äôt have to hide, it‚Äôs the most peaceful I‚Äôve ever been. Hopefully one day I have freedom to access a temple or monastery and have real community offline. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",Buddhism,1704353391.0,t3_18y7d2r,0.86,5
how to deal with discrimination/mistreatment?,"i started practicing buddhism in december. i started my new school in october. most of the kids in my school are black and christian (i was christian before). they think that if you‚Äôre black it automatically makes you christian and if you‚Äôre any other religion, you‚Äôre weird. a girl asked me ‚Äúso‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre african right?‚Äù to which i said yes and she followed up with ‚Äúyou‚Äôre also christian‚Äù to which i responded no. she started laughing at me and went to her friends to tell them i was buddhist and not christian. i was still nice to her despite this. a boy asked me what church i go to and i said ‚Äúi don‚Äôt go to church because i‚Äôm not christian‚Äù. he looked at me strangely. and he said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre muslim?‚Äù and i said ‚Äúno, buddhist. i started practicing a few weeks ago‚Äù. he began to laugh at me and asked me ‚Äúso your family is buddhist?‚Äù to which i said no and that my family is christian. he said my family was goated (slang for the best, having the right beliefs) and i should convert to christianity. he called me a stone worshipper and told me my faith is incorrect. things like getting called a stone worshipper, filthy devil or getting told i‚Äôm going to hell, receiving the harshest punishment from god and that i‚Äôm not a true african.

Not interested in happiness,"Hello. I have been studying Buddhist teachings for a while, and the more I learn, the more Buddhism resonates with me.

However, there is something strange. A lot of the texts, both translations and commentary, revolve around finding true happiness - the happiness that doesn't harm anyone, that is boundless and unconditional, etc. It seems that everything we do on this path is designed to bring us closer to that happiness. My issue is that I have no interest in it. I'm not depressed or gloomy, I'm just not motivated by all this talk about happiness, which is absolutely everywhere. My interest in Buddhism stems from something different, although I struggle to put my finger on it.

Every time I hear that we should do something because it will lead to true happiness, I lose a bit of spirit, because it feels like I'm following an interesting road that leads to a destination I couldn't care less about. It affects my motivation in some cases. For example, practicing goodwill involves wishing everyone happiness, including yourself, which is emphasised in the literature all the time. I struggle to do this sincerely. Again, it is not because I think I don't deserve happiness; rather, it is because I simply don't care for it. It's not my goal.

I would like to hear what Buddhists or other interested persons have to say. Is all the talk about happiness just a teaching tool to motivate most people, or is it truly essential? I could not find a post similar to this, forgive me if I missed something. Thank you for reading!

Thoughts on combat sports and Buddhism,"I train boxing frequently, spar people and participate in amateur fights.

I want to know your opinion on fighting in sports in regards to Buddhism, with the nature of the sport I'm inflicting physical pain but I wouldn't classify it as harm. When I get punched the person hasn't harmed me, I've just been outplayed.

Medicine Buddha Question,"I've been learning the different schools if Buddhism, interested in maybe picking one? I'm still figuring myself out. Anyway I came across Medicine Buddha randomly. (I honestly don't remember where). I really liked this Buddha though, almost drawn to him. 

I don't work in the medical field, but I have suffered from health anxiety my whole life. It's...somewhat under control. (It was real bad in my late 20s) I do have a slight interest in medicine, but not enough to make it a job. Just like helping people when I can and learn enough to curb my anxieties. 

I'm a bit confused about how Medicine Buddha fits into the schools though. My research isn't telling me much. I get his mantras and his 12 vows, which I like both. A small bit of history, but nothing on which schools he belongs in. I know it's mostly Mahayana, but it rarely specifies further. 

I've seen a bit of him mentioned in Pure Land, but all Pure Land research talks about Amitabha. 

I've also seen him mentioned in Tibetan Buddhism, but I'm still trying to wrap my head around that school. I like it but it's a lot to learn, so I don't know how he fits in exactly. 

So where does the Medicine Buddha belong? If I do decide to start one of the schools of Buddhism whichever one has Medicine Buddha may be the first I look into. I just don't know which one that is.

Advice on Buddhism,"My father has been a member of SGI for years; he has never involved me, but since he started practicing, his life has taken significant turns.

"Readings around ""modernist"" movements for Buddhism?","In Muslim circles, different movements arose in response to historical-critical scholarship.

While their core tenents remain (e.g. monotheism), this has many implications theologically, juridically, and practically.

Seeking Insight on Constructing Guided Meditations for Research,"‚Äã‚ÄãI'm currently embarking on a self-directed 4th-year psychology research project that aims to measure the differential effects of three types of meditation‚ÄîShamatha, Vipassana, and Metta‚Äîconducted within a virtual nature setting on self-reported Connectedness to Nature (CTN) and Perceived Restorativeness of enviornments (PR).

‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãUpon reviewing the literature surrounding my topic, there appears to be a lack of standardized or theoretically supported guidelines for creating guided meditations across the types I wish to study. This lack has implications for the validity and reliability of comparative analysis within meditation research, something I'm keen to address with my project.

I have a foundational understanding of these meditation techniques through personal practice and literature but am seeking deeper, more nuanced insights. Specifically, I'm looking for guidance on creating effective, theoretically sound guided meditation instructions that align well with the intended meditative practices.

What I'm Seeking:

Recommendations on Texts or Manuals: I'm seeking specific meditation manuals or original texts that best represent the techniques of Shamatha, Vipassana, and Metta. Understanding there are variances within each type, I am interested in texts or teachings that are considered foundational or particularly illustrative of the practices.

I am open to any criticism, corrections, or insights you might have. If you prefer a more detailed discussion, I'm also open to private messages or setting up a call to discuss further. Your input will not only aid in the advancement of this particular research but also contribute to the larger body of knowledge surrounding meditation, connectedness to nature, and psychological well-being.

Thank you in advance for your time and assistance. I look forward to engaging in fruitful discussions and learning from this community!

P.S Trait mindfulness and meditation experience will be covariates (or possible mediators/moderators) in this study so I can observe how the intervention's effects are influenced by both meditation experience and trait mindfulness. I am aware of the issues surrounding self-reported measures however my budget is literally 0$ for this study so I'm working with what I have and what has been used already in the literature :)",Buddhism,1704338373.0,t3_18y2u7i,0.33,0
Guanyin and the Oracle,"I recently visited a Taoist temple and since I was there I decided to go for the oracle at the altar of Guanyin (Kuan Yin). I'm a huge fan of I Ching, but the way I see I Ching is not as a divination/oracle/prophecy book but as ancient wisdom about human condition and existence in general distilled into powerful archetypes. The only reason I Ching survived numerous book tome burnings and destruction is that it wasn't taken seriously as a philosophy book as the authorities thought it was just a soothsayer brochure. I am curious about the oracle of Guanyin. Do people take it seriously and live accordingly? What if you get not a good lot from the oracle?

calling yourself a Buddhist,"for about 15 years I have explored a variety of faith communities and just been very interested in religion overall. i have never really felt the need to label my participation or obtain membership to any community‚Äî claim or be claimed. i was involved with in person communities, where belonging was affirmed through gathering. even then, i had an aversion to over-identifying with the religions themselves.

my relationship to buddhism different; it is unattached to a tangible community or temple environment. without people around me or participation in a community, i guess i am having a difficult time validating my involvement or affiliation. and i don‚Äôt feel as much resistance towards commitment/identification as i have before, which may be adding to this sense of wanting to be in community.

Is there a way to distance myself emotionally from my family? Please read. May sound off topic and selfish but i cannot think of anywhere where I can ask this question. So please help,"So i need to be with my family at least for the next three years, more if i dont put my emotions in order. See i asked psychologists but i find them very stupid and pseudoscientific. You see my family is very vain and money obsessed. They get plastic surgery, and since i live in a country full of corruption, doctors are willing to do whatever they can. I need to finish college to get a job, But when i talk about this to my psych she just says ""let them do whatever they can, you should love them and accept them"". Yes, like if i shouldnt be affected if they end up creepled in a hospital tied to some machines. if things keep going as they have been going for years thats what is going to happen. The irony is that they are supposed to control my life, they locked me up because i was suicidal and i smoke pot (and the shrinks said that it was obviously the pot, not their body dysmorphia and obsession with money) i came out from that hole unable to tak and they blame me (you just dont want to be happy).

&#x200B;

Thats a resum√©, its just that i thought maybe there is some kind of meditation i can do to kinda take an emotional distance of them. I mean not hating them, but get some distance. Like y'all. I mean you can read this and have compassion for people who have body dysmorphia, but you dont get totally crazy thinking about the innevetable. Thats what i want for myself. I dont live with them, since i have my own house. My dad passed away and i moved out from home because i got a house. But i havent finished college, and i still depend on the family enterprise. My plan is finish college and then cut them out from my life ASAP. But first i need to take control of this emotions. They dont listen.

See it this way friends, its like depending on people who will destroy their lives because of drugs addiction, it hurst because i grew up with them, but there is nothing i can do, they will have to learn the hard way, and when the time comes up i dont want to be emotionally involved. 

I know it may sound selfish but i am tired, i have pseudodementia because of my depression. It comes and goes. Buddhism has helped me a lot and i have faith in it.

Trouble dealing with awful family issues and trying to do the right thing..,"I'm trying  to be kind, compassionate, and understanding as I know that's the way I should be, but fighting the urge to freak out on family. 


     My grandparents passed 7 and 9 years ago, and my mom took care of them for the last 6 years of their lives.  She dropped everything and spent the good years of her retirement looking after her folks so they didn't have to go into nursing home.  Very shortly after, my dad passed, unexpectedly and my mom has so much to deal with. She's early 70s but stress and family disfunction amongst her crazy sisters has taken its toll on her spirit, physical and mental health.   

Grandfather enabled one particular sister of my moms to be worthless and dependent, and have victim mentality to the point she can't take care of herself and now uses and abuses my mom.  She abuses everyone in her circle, including her 2 children who are adult age.  My mom has continued enabling, because she doesn't want to see her sister suffer, but all her problems are her own doing. .  Sister is mentally abusive, blames all her problems on everyone else, and takes full advantage of my mom's kindness and compassion. 

      There is alot of money involved, and that's not so much my worry, as is my mom, her happiness, quality of life, mental health and such.  I'm very angry and disgusted and trying to help my mom navigate this whole situation, without freaking out myself, and losing my shit on the crazy aunt who won't ever learn or understand how toxic she is.  I'm at my wits end on this one.  So much that I'm losing sleep over it.  My mom is a little over the top with her Christian beliefs and thinks I'm wrong for not subscribing to that as ive been folllowing the teachings of buddhism for the majority of my adult life, so theres that riff to contend with as well.  

    Any advice from my fellow compassionate humans on how to navigate this to a peaceful end would be greatly appreciated.  This may not be a good place for this, and if so, I apologize, but I could use some guidance or reading resources if anyone has anything they think might help me!

Solo beginner looking for advice and/or guidance,"hello all,

i am in a bit of a difficult situation and i think i just don‚Äôt quite know what to do. buddhism is something that has called to me since i was young, but i had it in my mind that because im white and european its not something i can practice (i realize now that this notion is false).

i grew up in the chicago area, and over the summer i was attending a kadampa meditation center close to my home. but unfortunately i am in canada for university. there is a buddhist facility near-ish to my campus but transportation is difficult without a car and the meeting are late and night so i don‚Äôt feel entirely comfortable taking public transportation that late as a solo young woman. i am in a small town so that once center is really the only option. 

the temple i attended over the summer reccomended some books to go along with their lessons (written by venerable geshe kelsang gyatso) that i have with me at university. i suppose that is a good place to start, but i am weary of leaning completely by myself. for a multitude of reasons (appropriation, false teachings, incorrect practices, etc). i am really just asking what i should be doing, if anything. maybe the best course of action is to wait until im done with university, but i have 3.5 years left :/

if anyone has any suggestions, maybe online centers, resources to look at, etc. i also apologize if this exact question has been asked before. i am new to the sub and completely useless on reddit.

Attainment of Nirvana and even its quest seems nigh Impossible,"Based on my brief 10 day meditation course at Igatpuri few years back, I did learn Vipassana meditation but needless to say, I neglected regular practice. Based on my discussion with few other folks who had attended with me, they also reciprocate my same feeling. They felt good for a while but eventually, we tend to remember that we are Engineers, not Monks!

The system S.N. Goenka ji taught is based entirely on the realization of *Anitya* (impermanence) which is only possible once craving and aversion are entirely stopped. But the obvious flaw in the system is: *Where will the motivation to remove craving and aversion in life come from?*

At a theoretical level, I can understand that they're the reason for *dukkha* (suffering) but considering that the desire for cessation of dukkha or attainment of Nirvana itself is a kind of craving, it's almost like an infinite loop. Why will the ""establishment of cravings"" inside your mind ever let that happen? A loop will always want to repeat itself and not end. Once in a while, I do tend to escape its grip and meditate for a few hours (like I did today) but that happens only occasionally. It's almost like fighting your mind itself at some level.

What I've observed is that despite the realism of almost infinite miseries or *dukkha* like depression, loss of relatives, financial issues, etc. in my life, there is also a solid counter force to it called *Hope* which makes the dukkha feel tiny in comparison. Hope makes you forget dukkha and thus leads you away from the path of Nirvana!

I just don't know what I should do to motivate myself more to perform Vipassana meditation regularly. All approaches are welcome, be it pragmatic, theoretical or philosophical.",Buddhism,1704223364.0,t3_18wxqn0,0.87,19
Is knowingly trying to farm karma ok?,"I ask because if you avoid doing something to avoid bad karma I don‚Äôt think anyone would disagree with that, however if you do something  good for the sake of farming karma to contribute to a better future life all of a sudden your exact motivation is in question, and possibly won‚Äôt get karma for it. (I think)
When it comes to avoiding bad karma, your motivation is arbitrary. Does that mean that you still committed that act because deep down you really wanted to do it?
Then conversely, say you lived a terrible life and you‚Äôre on your death bed and out of fear of Hell you donated more money to charity that has ever been donated. Does that money that will go to greatly decreasing the suffering of others become arbitrary because that individual didn‚Äôt have the exact motivation necessary to reap the benefits of that charitable act?",Buddhism,1704215102.0,t3_18wuaer,0.78,20
The Result of Craving.,"I know this is not a political sub.  But, I want to offer an example of what happens when someone is so entrapped by craving, delusion of self, and subsequently, samsara.  

In order to reduce our suffering, and those of others, we must develop and show compassion.  I am suggesting that we include Mr. Donald Trump in our loving kindness meditations.

You can tell from everything that is happening that he is suffering.  We are suffering observing the consequences of his entrapment, his craving, his toxic view of self, and the hinderances he has to end his suffering.  

May all beings be safe and secure.

May all beings have their spiritual and materials needs fulfilled.

Losing faith in buddhism,"Hello my friends- within like the past hour, i've genuinely lost at least a significant amount of faith in buddhism. And whilst it is likely that i will regain my faith and/or that i will go to sleep and wake up with at least some amount of my former faith restored, i suppose it's still good to make this post because I do need advice regarding my situation.

Within like the past hour, i've looked through material regarding buddhism- things regarding Tantric sex and misogony in buddhism. The sultras contain mysoginistic rhetoric. But i don't know man, the way there is an obvious power inbalance in instances when tantric sex is practised between a lama/guru/master and consort, the many cases of lamas- people supposed to have progressed down the spiritual path further than us, doing horrible things sexually with abuse of power, sexual assault and what not. And the way some buddhism still teaches that women can only obtain enlightenment in the form of a man. I know that all these can have logical explanations- the sultras were written long after Buddha's death and hence, the misogony could be later additions and lamas are too human and can be ignorant and do things that they shouldn't. But buddhism is kinda starting to feel empty, which is ironic given that emptiness is a key buddhist teaching.

I really don't know. And i do know that a lot of what i've described (tantric sex and lamas) is mostly tibetan buddhism, but i'm losing faith in buddhism in general.

Can Bhava-tanha (craving to become) be used for good?,"It was eye-opening to me to learn about Bhava-tanha, the craving to become something or achieve something. In Western society, we're usually taught this is a good thing. Set a goal, and constantly keep it in mind, constantly visualize success, it's fine to crave the achievement of the goal - this is how you become successful.

Less so in Buddhism. Craving to become, even if the Goal is enlightenment, is a no no because it leads to attachment. An *aspiration* is okay, but there is a big, yet subtle, difference between aspiration and strong desire with some element of craving.

This made me think of Arnold Schwarzenegger's philosophy. He is one of my inspirations. And he talks about being filled with desire for the Mr. Olympia title, constantly visualizing it day and night to keep him going. Here is a glimpse: [https://youtu.be/u\_ktRTWMX3M?si=7v3g04YxVIb44gs-&t=141](https://youtu.be/u_ktRTWMX3M?si=7v3g04YxVIb44gs-&t=141).

I would not quite call his mentality one of subtle aspiration. He really does emphasize that he keeps the goal constantly in mind, and in some ways that he *craves* it. However, he's been able to use his hyper-intensive goal-focused mentality to achieve many things in his life, from bodybuilding, to acting, to becoming a politician, all at the highest levels, coming from a humble background. 

As I'm sure many of you know, the downside of ""craving"" in Buddhism is associated with the crash one experiences if one does not achieve the goal. The more one craves, the more one experiences aversion to a scenario where one doesn't get the object of one's craving (in theory).

After learning about Bhava-tanha, part of me always tries to tone it down whenever I get overly excited about achieving something. But I question sometimes whether this excitement is a bad thing - it is damn helpful for motivation to be hyper-goal focused. And I believe it might be possible to be filled with desire for something, which creates a lot of energy, but then quickly move on if the object of one's desire doesn't come to fruition, vs. being overcome with suffering. I think there are upsides to this strong feeling of desire that outweigh the downsides.

But I find that studying Buddhism can sometimes lead to trying to cut down feelings of desire at their root. While well-intentioned, I feel this mentality may be doing more harm than good, because most of us won't achieve enlightenment in this lifetime and would be more than happy with a life like the one Arnold has created for himself. Yes, he may not be enlightened, but he has done a lot of good in the world and inspired many to live healthy, fulfilling lives. If Arnold got really into Buddhism when he was young, what kind of life would he have had?

So this is just some food for thought and maybe it will engender some discussion. I'm familiar with Tantric philosophy and the ability to transmute desire into wisdom energy. But in the earlier stages of the Mahayana path, the focus is on gaining control of and reducing desire first.",Buddhism,1704201376.0,t3_18wp6yg,1.0,11

"buddhism isn't about truth, it's about the ending of suffering","happy new year 2024! 

one realization i had this year was: buddhism isn't really about truth, it's about the end of suffering.

the entire system is built from the ground up to end suffering for all beings, resting on this goal as its foundation.

the truth is also important, but at some point, it becomes irrelevant. fundamental reality is found to be ineffable *(too great or extreme to be expressed or described in words)*, partly because we just don't have the mental power to understand it. 

hope you have an excellent 365 days ahead.

EDIT: Many threads are arguing that truth is important. Famously, there are 2 truths in Buddhism. Conventional truth which includes scientific knowledge is not necessary, but can be helpful. absolute truth is definitely more important to know. I am not sure whether it is important to know everything about absolute truth... in fact, I am not sure if it is even possible to know absolute truth fully, or whether knowledge is a category that can even survive in the face of absolute truth. If anyone does have scriptural insight into this, I would love to know.

To What Degree is This Stance from the Surangama Sutra Anti-Vajrayana?,"Hey everyone - to contextualize this post, I recently took refuge within a Tibetan Buddhist temple and am a very new practitioner of Vajrayana - essentially taking part in offerings and ceremonies as well as empowerments while practicing shamatha meditation. I've been reading The Surangama Sutra and have found it very profound, but came across the following quote from it today. I'm wondering to what degree this quote might constitute anti-Vajrayana sentiment, whether given the historical context it may be an intentional or unintentional slight to Tibetan Buddhism and specifically the concept of sexual tantric practice:

""No matter how much you may practice in order to transcend the stress of entanglement with perceived objects, you will never transcend that stress until you have freed yourself from sexual desire. Even very intelligent people who can enter samadhi while practicing meditation in stillness will be certain to fall into the realm of demons upon their rebirth if they have not renounced **sexual activity**. The best among them will become kings among demons; those at intermediate levels will be members of demon hordes; female demons will be at the lowest levels. These demons will attract groups of disciples and will tell them that they have realized unsurpassed enlightenment.""

The teachings against sexual desire aren't surprising, but it does specifically point out sexual activity as not only a downfall but something inevitably corruptive of Buddha's teachings and even demonic. I'm curious as to thoughts on this stance and to what degree it might be either propagandistic or hyperbolized. ",Buddhism,1704227891.0,t3_18wzmy6,0.63,2

"What is the best Buddhist method, to help with OCD?","Hello all, and I appreciate you taking the time to read this, I hope this post finds you well. I suffer from severe OCD, and I cannot afford medication or therapy, so those options for me are not currently available, in case anyone says I need to go see a doctor/therapist. I've come from Christianity to Buddhism, because I have found that Christianity does not deal well in the realm of the mind, and it's afflictions. However Buddhism does, and I find that it's full of methods, and Buddha was a master of the mind as well.

In regards to my question, I am looking to deepen my practice in general, but also looking to see if there is any type of method I can use to at the very least alleviate my OCD? The current theme of OCD I'm suffering from is hyperawareness, specifically hyperaware to time. I'm aware of every seconds that passes, my mind can't escape it, and it creates extreme anxiety, because there's no end to it. It creates delusional, irrational thoughts, time isn't relative to what I'm doing because I'm aware of it, no matter what doing. 

So, returning to the now, being mindful, returning to the breath, is precisely what my OCD is fixated on lol. It would be exchanging one fixation for another, focus on time or focus on breath, is like focusing on blinking, being mindful of the now, all the exact same thing, so I'm not sure what to do, because it all creates extreme anxiety, and irrational thoughts and delusions trying to figure out how to end the anxiety which in this case has no compulsions, because these things can't in and of themselves be stopped, it's just an infinite fixation that I cannot stop, and don't know how to overcome, until I fall asleep at night and the cycle continues the second I wake up in the morning.

I didn't know if anyone was aware of any other kinds of techniques, mantras, distractions, simply practicing good and avoiding bad  what the Buddha might have to say on subject, etc? Like I said, I can't afford a doctor or therapist, so those options aren't available to me.

After all, my goals are not required for my survival--with modern medicine, I can expect to live a decently long life, and I'm already doing well in my schooling, which will help with my career to earn money and feed myself.

So what's the point? Why not just give up on goals that are non-essential? I thought of asking this in this subreddit as I heard of the Buddhda's teachings on suffering coming from desire--if I rid myself of this desire, will I be happier?

Butter Lamp Offering Practice Experience,"Happy New Year Everyone!

I started a butter lamp offering practice recently and it‚Äôs brought a higher level of peace to the environment and fulfillment to my practice. 

I started making my own butter lamps. I bought a brass butter lamp, Clarified Butter ‚ÄúGhee‚Äù, and candle wicks. 

I create a new butter lamp each week and do the offering practice over the weekend.
I continue to use the lamp throughout the week and let it burn out Friday evening to be recreated in the morning.

What‚Äôs a universal word for the state of mindful observation?,"When I share my meditation practice and the practice of active awareness of the ego, I struggle to describe it or even have a word for what I‚Äôm talking about. What I mean by this, is the state of not just acknowledging the existence of your ego mentally, but actually observing it directly without judgement, often referred to in our religion as the Buddha nature or enlightenment.

‚ÄúBuddha nature‚Äù tends to alienate people from other beliefs by connecting it to a specific religion, ‚Äúego death‚Äù is not necessarily accurate because often times the goal is not to kill the ego, ‚Äúawakening/enlightenment‚Äù are good terms but they carry stigma and mean different things to a lot of people, ‚Äúisness‚Äù is my favorite but it‚Äôs not commonly used and sounds awkward, lastly ‚Äúpure being‚Äù or ‚Äúpure awareness‚Äù always strike me as demeaning other states of consciousness as being ‚Äúimpure‚Äù which I personally don‚Äôt think is productive.

Do you still get ‚Äúbad‚Äù karma if you thought you were doing something good ?,"If someone did something that was atrociously bad.

Would they still be receiving negative karma ? Or would it be more neutral, per the law of emptiness, and that it isn‚Äôt up to us how the rest of the world PERCEIVES our actions since they are empty of a nature, and it only matters how WE perceive our actions? And that we can actively choose to see the neutrality of all our actions? 

So in that case is it less about the literal things you do and more about how you think about those things? Like if you do something without any feelings of guilt or shame at any point and you actually feel like you just did a good thing even if it was ‚Äúbad‚Äù in the eyes of others, would it have good/neutral rippled effects for YOU since you‚Äôre the experiencer?

"Book review - Rebirth: A Guide to Mind, Karma, and Cosmos in the Buddhist World","*Book author: Roger R. Jackson*  
*Publication date and publisher: 2022, Shambhala*

I stumbled upon this book some weeks ago. The publisher describes it as the first-ever guide to rebirth in Buddhism in which the history and scope of Buddhist approaches to this belief are treated systematically, and Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse, Jos√© Cabezon, Jay Garfield, among others, have written endorsements for it, so I thought that it might be a good handy guide to quote from and to refer people to when everyone's most favorite question pops up in the sub, and gave it a read.

First, some background regarding the book should be mentioned briefly. I'm not familiar with the writer Roger R. Jackson but he's ""Professor Emeritus of Asian Studies and Religion at Carleton College. He has nearly 50 years of experience with the study and practice of Buddhism, particularly in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition ... Roger is a highly respected and beloved scholar, Dharma teacher, and writer. He has authored many scholarly books and articles, and is a frequent contributor to Lion‚Äôs Roar, Buddhadharma, and Tricycle magazines.""

The author's credentials are solid enough, and he's done a pretty good job surveying the landscape of rebirth teachings. However, as he explains in the epilogue, his own position regarding rebirth is agnostic, predicated on behaving ""as if"" rebirth is true. So if you had hoped that the book would also include some novel defenses of rebirth teachings, that isn't the case. But I thought that other than being too lenient on modernist ideas of Buddhism, the author handles the subject fairly, and is interested in presenting the teachings clearly rather than judging them or arguing for/against.

This is a somewhat deceptive book, in a way, because although you might go in expecting information just about rebirth, you will actually get a few summaries of Buddhist history and doctrines. There's even a brief overview of non-Indian ideas of rebirth, which I found fascinating. At times, the book reads like a digest version of Williams' Mahayana Buddhism (to which it is clearly indebted). By presenting these teachings and summarizing them, it provides the context onto which karma and so on fit, and can serve to dispel received ideas such as how Zen doesn't believe in these things. This is excellent news for various sorts of beginners, or Buddhists who didn't learn much about traditions other than theirs, but for others it might feel as if the space taken up by this information could have been used for deeper discussion on rebirth and karma.

One of the best parts in the book is the survey of Indian ideas on rebirth. Jackson demonstrates clearly that these ideas were by no means normative (or ancestral) at the time, that the Buddha placed rebirth and karma at the front and center of his teaching, and that, far from repeating popular beliefs, he contributed enormously to systematic and detailed understandings of karma and rebirth while providing his distinct version. The author even analyzes and refutes the two strategies of denials used to distort the Buddha‚Äôs views.

The structure of the book is as follows: after a survey of Indian and non-Indian concepts of rebirth, we move on to an analysis of the Buddha‚Äôs teachings on the matter. After this comes the ‚Äúwhere‚Äù (six realms), ‚Äúhow‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of rebirth. This is followed by a survey of Indian Mahayana views as well as a summary of Indian Buddhist arguments for rebirth, with a focus on Dharmakƒ´rti‚Äôs defense, because the author wrote a paper on this as a student. After this comes a discussion of Theravada, East Asian, Inner Asian, and modern views of rebirth. The first three, as well as the parts on early Buddhism and Mahayana, also include a discussion of views on female birth and the status of women in each zone considered. Finally, there‚Äôs a survey of contemporary debates and ideas, concluding with the author‚Äôs own view.

A great deal of issues, including perennial questions such as ‚Äúhow can there be rebirth without a self‚Äù, are touched upon in these parts. Overall, the book is educative, easy to follow, and pretty wide in scope, designed to be read and digested easily by a large public, Buddhist or not. But for that reason, those wishing for a heavy scholarly discussion of these subjects will have to wait.

One criticism I'll make is that Pali discourses are cited a lot when ‚Äúearly‚Äù views are discussed, because the author strangely conceives of the Theravada as being the same as Sthaviravada, due to the two words meaning the same thing, even though this is not accepted by scholarship (e.g. by Bhikkhu Sujato). More problematically, the Pali Canon is considered to have been closed around 2000 years ago, but to my knowledge, this is not definitely established. The existence of the Agamas is alluded to, but they are never referenced, and this is disappointing especially in light of how the ‚ÄúKalama Sutta‚Äù is briefly looked at later. I also felt that an important omission from the discussion is the ‚Äúphysical space‚Äù in which rebirth takes place. The discussion on the six realms doesn‚Äôt touch much on the spatial and temporal cosmology of Buddhism, even though questions on these aspects feed every facet of modern discussions on rebirth: it‚Äôs confusing to some, a reason for criticism or a source of positive arguments for others, and a point of comparison with scientific theories for yet others. Since the book is very much not strictly about the teaching of rebirth, it would have been interesting to read something on this matter as well.

Overall, a pretty helpful book for beginners, for Buddhists who are in denial of what their traditions actually accept, and for Buddhists who want a concise reference for doctrines surrounding rebirth and karma.",Buddhism,1704115418.0,t3_18vwomu,0.9,16

How do I let go of the anger? Found out that the man I have dated (and broken up with) was lying and cheating all along.,"Sorry for the long post ahead.

I was dating this man who claimed to have just broken up with his ‚Äúex‚Äù. I couldn‚Äôt really trust him and there were signs of his ‚Äúex‚Äù still in his life so I ended things after a while.

Few months later we reconnected and this time started dating more seriouslyx, thinking he and his ‚Äúex‚Äù have been completely cut off.

Again I‚Äôve had my suspicions and still couldn‚Äôt trust him and for the longest time I kept thinking it‚Äôs just my past trauma and it‚Äôs just me being overly paranoid.

Well I finally ended things with him in early December because I found out he booked a trip without letting me know, thought that was very sketchy. And just last week I found that he was traveling with his ‚Äúex‚Äù. Upon more digging I found out they were never broken up - he was lying and cheating on her the whole time.

I messaged the girlfriend to let her know of his cheating, she confronted him (and he even denied it!) I then blocked both of them and tried to move on.

It should have been enough but I find myself still waking up angry and unable to relax - I think I‚Äôm mostly angry at him (who lied and showed no respect for me, despite all the time I‚Äôve questioned him and he gave all sorts of excuses), but I‚Äôm also angry at myself (that I have my suspicions, forced myself to ‚Äútake a leap of faith‚Äù and to work on my trust issues, only to end up betrayed again). I also find myself obsessing over the details and trying to ‚Äúdebunks‚Äù each lies .

I recognize that I haven‚Äôt been so attached to him and I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm hurt, but angry.

Stopping Reincarnation An Prompts For Meditation.,"As someone that is trying to start on the path of Siddhartha Gautama, I must say that being alive and continuing life in morality, good health and happiness is the point of life in every other religion I am aware of, and therefore Buddhist teaching seems to conflict with them *all* on their main assertion. I believe in Gods, Spirits, Ancestors, and I want to worship all of them. They all say to stay alive, be moral, and continue the family line. They have given me courage, love, comfort and sustenance across my life, though for most of it I didn't know it. They have never given up on me. I want to submit to their will for the rest of my days, and nothing will pry them from me, so I'm looking to mix my religion with whatever I can from Buddhism, but obviously I can't do it fully, please forgive my ignorance and implied arrogance. I understand many Chinese people do the same thing, so it can't be that bad, right? i would appreciate any advice on this point.

I love everything else I've learned about Buddhism so far, which admittedly isn't much, a religion that essentially functions as a science and a store of wisdom is incredibly appealing to a Westerner who comes from a 100% Dogma based religion and an Aristotelian intellectual path. I particularly love the tradition of meditating on prompts, I once did something similar and came out with some cool ideas, so I know it works, despite the complaints I've heard from ignorant Westerners.

For instance here are two:

The first law of thermodynamics states that it is impossible for energy to be created or destroyed in a closed system (and all existence is a closed system), and cause and effect (not the principle of causality, but the colloquial idea that things that happen require other things to have happened in order to cause them) exist simultaneously in a cyclical or infinitely regressing universe.

(The next is in thought)

Ponder.

Together they would have created a mind capable of controlling the entire universe (something we could call at least one God) given infinite repetition. There is no evidence for such a mind in the material universe, therefore the cycle or regress is not infinite, and the universe was created (by at least one mind we could call a God), and if that didn't happen, then to change the nature of both stable, eternal natures, there must have been a choice to join them, as they haven't been together long enough to make a God in this universe yet. Cause and effect and energy were joined by choice by at least one mind capable of controlling at least two universes (Or something we could call a God). There is a God. Atheism hasn't made sense since I discovered this intuitive argument years ago.

After that the next meditation:

Given Zeno's Dichotomy (The notion that moving toward an object is impossible because the time spent to get to it can be divided infinitely, even below planck time) simultaneously existing with the fact that matter must have a minimum unit in order to be said to exist, even below planck length. 

Ponder.

Time must have a minimum unit (later I found out that this has been thought of already, it's called a chronon), and so must everything else in order to be said to exist.

Cause and effect (and therefore logic itself) crossed into this universe at the great ordering I described in the last meditation description. Therefore, some must have come in first. Therefore, logic has a minimum unit, or something I call a Thales. Thales can be said to be present in the macro and less focused in the micro, after all in the macro world logic operates on laws that are universal, but at the quantum level they don't hold true, therefore two things that contradict are true in the same sense at once. In other words the law of non-contradiction is not native to this universe, this universe is one of of complete chaos and illogic without the joining.

The thalamus and its role in conscious awareness,"Wasn't quite sure where to post this but I do have a great respect for this sub. I was raised to have a deep respect for Buddhism and appreciate how among this community, one can find answers that can help in a spiritual sense, while also being quite balanced and rational.

I have always been of the belief that the brain receives/filters out consciousness, rather than generating it, and wanted to ask about something to do with neuroscience. There were studies done not too long ago where monkeys were put under anesthesic and when they had their thalamus stimulated, they woke up.

Besides my opposition to testing this stuff on animals, it left me in doubts of those philosophical views. Spirituality has been greatly comforting after a loss in the family so I want to know, does that study show that the thalamus has any role in creating consciousness? Does it point in the direction of our brains creating it rather than it coming from an outside source? Hope it's okay to post here.

Ten years of Buddhism.,"While writing another comment I suddenly realised that yesterday marks ten years since I first practiced Buddhism.

I was having a rough time of it in college and heard that this meditation thing was good for reducing stress, anxiety, depression. So I did what any good redditor would do and hopped on /r/Meditation to learn more about it. From there I was linked to /r/Buddhism and I started reading *Mindfulness in Plain English*. It has four chapters and on Dec 28 I decided that I would read one per day, before putting it into action on New Years Day. Well, by Dec 30 I was so excited by the first half that I threw out my timeline and decided to get right to it. A few days later I discovered the Four Noble Truths and knew instantly that they were correct and that this was the path for me. I know that I'm rather impulsive by nature so I (unusually prudently) decided to give it a 1 year trial period before committing fully.

Ten years later, what can I say? I'm still alive and practicing with hope and confidence. Thanks in large part to this subreddit and the many people who have been inflicted with my presence (on several accounts) over the past ten years.

How to move on and let go of a parent,"Hello everyone,

I want to apologise in advance as English is not my first language, so sorry for any mistake. 

2023 have been a very hard year for me, my mother finally decided to divorce my very abusive father, who put my mother, my brother and I through so much mental, physical and financial abuse throughout our whole lives. I am 29 and, because of the abuse, I started suffering with my mental health ever since I was 11. There came a point in my life when I was able to ""give up"" the suffering and live my life, but now that the divorce is happening I realise that I didn't let it go, it's almost like I was able to lock everything in a drawer and now that the drawer it's opening back up I find myself the most depressed I have ever been, my mind is as tumultuous as it can be. 

I have a lot of resentment towards my father and at the same time, because of his manipulations, I'm questioning my whole life.

"Zen, and understanding 'no self' through community bonds and intimacy?","So I‚Äôm slowly getting back into my practice in a deliberate way that is unlike how I have engaged with it before. I follow mostly Zen (Mahayana) and feel that much of it speaks to me and I‚Äôm truly excited to continue re-engaging with it.

However I am not finding much on how Zen engages with the concept of intimacy and community. This is sort of difficult to articulate, but from my perspective, a good amount of Zen practice is based on internal contemplation, and where other sentient beings are involved, they are seen as opportunities to be part of the practice of contemplation.

I recognize that this is a very crude summation, but while that approach does speak to me, I am curious if Mahayana/Zen teachings have a more defined conceptualization of sentient beings in the way of talking about bonds, intimacy, community, parts of one, etc? Typing this out now, I want to say the answer is no because the teachings would argue that it would go down the path of attachments and creating karmic energy that would be the result of those interactions.

But while I am grateful for the lessons Zen has provided so far, I feel that looking at other sentient beings, particularly humans, as solely opportunities to practice misses out on an opportunity to understand ‚Äòno self‚Äô through communion with others. Again, not sure if I‚Äôm articulating this well, but I would love to have any words and thoughts around this as I think about this more.

Why Believe in Karma and Reincarnation?,"So for the last few years I've been interested in Buddhism but whenever I try getting into it the idea of karma or reincarnation always put me off. I know they're inseparable from Buddhism so I definitely couldn't call myself a Buddhist if I don't believe in them and I don't think I'm ever going to start believing in them.  
So what I wanted to ask to anyone who's converted to Buddhism is why you believe in karma and reincarnation? To me living life just one time and following the barest rules of conduct feels like too much work so the idea of living hundreds of thousands of lives until you eventually end up living a good enough life to escape the cycle seems a lot worse than just not believing in anything. And a big part of why I got into spiritual stuff is because it makes me feel more at peace so having something so upsetting be part of a major religion seems strange to me.  
Almost everything else I've heard to do with Buddhism apart from the karma and reincarnation stuff is great.

Suicide in Buddhism,"Ever thought of suicide? Think suicide can ""end all my sufferings""? Let us think again and view into what Buddhism have taught upon suicide and suffering.

In the [Sutta Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta: Setting the Wheel of Dhamma in Motion](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn56/sn56.011.than.html), it is said:

>""Now this, monks, is the noble truth of stress: Birth is stressful, aging is stressful, **death is stressful**; sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, & despair are stressful; association with the unbeloved is stressful, separation from the loved is stressful, not getting what is wanted is stressful. In short, the five clinging-aggregates are stressful.

Death is a process of suffering, by suiciding you are just dying and suffering more. Then, to say that ""all my sufferings will be ended when I suicide"" is a wrong view. Why so? This is due to a simple reason, Buddhism believe in infinite life rebirth, not ""YOLO (You Only Live Once)"", by being attached to YOLO and thinking suffering ends after death is not in accordance to the right view of the Dhamma, that is the wrong view, not in accordance with Noble Eightfold Path.

Furthermore, since Infinite Life is a concept, it is known that the next rebirth is highly dependant on your last thought before death and your karma. Since the last thought of death is practically full of suffering, pain, regret, fear, anger, the next rebirth is highly likely to be in the three lower realms, where the amount of suffering is WAYYYY worse.

Thinking that you can get to Pure Land via rebirth? That would not work in my opinion, why so? Pure Land requires you to have good roots and merits, to practice the Dharma and uphold precepts.

The Contemplation Sutra on Amitayus say;

>There are three other kinds of sentient beings who also attain birth. Who are the three \[other kinds of sentient beings\]? They are, first, **those who have a compassionate heart, abstain from killing, and observe the precepts;** second, those who chant the Mahayana sutras of greater scope; and third, those who practice the six forms of mindfulness. They aspire to be born in that buddha land by transferring there the merit of practice.

By commiting suicide, you are killing yourself, that breaks the first precept. By killing yourself, you have no compassion towards yourself and others, why? Since you kill yourself, you do not feel compassion for your own body, you caused others to feel afflicted due to your death, creating more bad karma.

Although there are moral debate on suicide for those who are in extreme pain, that is for the professionals to decide, however, we layperson who are in normal suffering, that does not result in severe medical conditions (and has not been approved by any professionals), should avoid any forms of suicide as it will bring the most harm one can think of.

# What to do when I am suffering?

Practice Dharma, practice Metta, practice Noble Eightfold Path. The Buddha has laid down teachings to help us get on path and be happy for this life. One can do meditation, or even chanting Buddhas name, or finding virtuous sangha community friends. Remember, we are all on the path to be liberation of suffering and we will help eachother in need, so do not suicide!

If you, are having such thoughts, and want to find a community of virtuous friends to talk to, you are highly recommended to join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nnyYVEga), anyone else can join too! If you are thinking of suicide, please call the suicide hotline and get advice.

Can you get bad karma for taking inheritance from a parent who doesn't want to give it?,"Hey, so two years ago, my dad had this huge fight with my half-siblings. They moved out and didn't bother visiting him, even when he was in the hospital. Basically, they disowned him. I stepped in, moved in with him, and took care of him since then. I could see how upset and disappointed he was with my half-siblings. Sometimes, I'd catch him secretly crying.

He'd tell me how disappointed he was with my half-siblings and he conveyed his strong reluctance for my half-siblings to inherit his wealth. It kinda sucks because they're living the good life‚Äîgreat education, awesome careers‚Äîall thanks to my dad. He was always being super thrifty, even if it meant he had to skip meals, just to make sure we had good lives. He'd rather starve than let his kids go hungry.

He'd always remind me not to let them near his funeral if something happened to him and insisted that all his wealth had to go to me. I told him it wasn't up to me; he needed to put it in his will. But, well, he didn't, and he passed away suddenly. I did end up inheriting some money and properties, but I'm thinking of giving them up because my half-siblings are constantly pressuring me and threatening to sue. Some might think I'm dumb, but I just want a chill life, and I reckon earning my own keep is more meaningful. I've taken a bit of money to do some charity stuff on behalf of my dad.

Wondering, how does Buddhism see this kind of situation? Will my half-siblings get some karma for inheriting my dad's wealth when he wasn't cool with it? I feel it's unfair to my dad considering how they treated him, but I don't want to get into a full-blown fight with them. I just want my peace and let karma sort them out.

But I used to do it maybe once a year max, and didn't experience anything other than bad trips. So, I'm not claiming any acid enlightenment). Me experience had until then been of trauma, anxiety, depression, and a sense of losing all capacity to feel anything, almost like my brain slowly dying.  


Anyway, somehow I started reading about things I hadn't before. First I started reading about Castaneda, then somehow came across Bardo Thodol, and listened to it before going to sleep. These things all happened maybe within a week. Then one day again I was looking for answers and came across this book called  **The Mindful Way through Depression** (John Kabaat Zinn) and read 2-3 chapters from it and suddenly things clicked for me. I got this vivid and clear understanding that thoughts were not of the huge importance that I had until then given them and that if they were, they would have helped me in some way or the other in the last 26-27 years that I had them. I don't remember everything and the whole realization I had, and even if I did I bet it would be hard to put it in words.  


I tried meditating as prescribed in the book (classic breath meditation) and felt something. Concentration, some pleasure and etc. Then I meditated again maybe 30 mins after the first one. I meditated for 20 mins (2nd time meditating in my life) and experienced an explosion of joy and sense of freedom. My whole brain awakened from the sleep of depression and it was so intense that I stopped meditating. After that I had this lingering feeling (it feels like someone is squeezing your head) that I used to get when doing acid that lasted for multiple hours.  


This started a period in my life of daily meditation and learning from teachers on youtube. I was mainly identifying with Yuttadhammo Bhikku whose videos I was learning a lot from. I was chasing after that feeling of rapture, and I guess my meditation suffered because of it (as I thought a good meditation was what I felt that first time). Despite that I kept meditating for an hour a day or maybe more sometimes, and also being mindful while walking, doing dishes etc.   


As my mind got much clearer, sharper, and focused, I managed to start a career in programming. I wanted to become an urban monk, who works to support himself but dedicates the rest of his time meditating. But alas, that didn't work. Programming, analytical thinking, interaction with people it all distracted me from my meditation and Buddhism.  


It's been 3 years now, and I have made some attempts to go back to meditating, but stopped shortly after. In a way I'm still comparing my meditations to that first time of explosion of joy, and it kind of hinders me. Now I'm back drowning in depression, and in danger of losing my job because of how depressed I am. That first time I had found The Buddha in the purest way - because I wanted to escape suffering.   


I don't know what my question is or why I wrote this. I feel like I lost my awakening partly because I wasn't a part of a sangha, and was left alone with my practice with no guidance or support. Maybe I want to know if anyone had any similar experience of being awakened and losing it later. Or maybe advice on how to get that passion, that feeling of urgency and maybe fear to get back to meditation. I swear, around 2 months ago I had this dream that I was 60 years old and I was scared that I wasted my whole life and didn't follow the Buddha's path. But I'm in the slumber of the depressed mind which lulls you into a sleep. ",Buddhism,1703982014.0,t3_18uu86y,0.86,14
End of the Calendar Year. Memories,"Dear Buddhist monks, laymans and practicioners.


As we approach the end of the year, I find myself contemplating the teachings I've encountered living in the present moment. The emphasis on the now, without dwelling on the past or future, is a recurring theme in books, dharma talks, and Buddha's quotes.

Yet, as a novice in my Buddhist practice, I grapple with this notion. Reflecting on the past year doesn't seem harmful; in fact, it conjures both pleasant and painful memories. It's a natural inclination for us humans.

Recalling past experiences can be emotionally challenging, given how our thoughts and experiences shape us. The photographs on our walls capture moments with loved ones, both joyful and challenging. We hold onto these images not to live in the past but to honor and remember what has shaped us.

While it's acknowledged that living in the past is counterproductive, many of us find solace in nostalgic recollections. Personally, closing my eyes can transport me to moments with my late mother, evoking both sadness and happiness simultaneously.

I'm curious about your perspective on this. Is revisiting old memories occasionally truly detrimental, or can it serve a purpose in our spiritual journey?",Buddhism,1704033718.0,t3_18v93iz,0.57,1

Ignoring My Calling and Fearing Naraka,"I've seen many discussions come and go on this subreddit. One of them happens to be about the Buddhist Hell, Naraka. For some reason, when I read of Naraka outside of Buddhist teachings, they talk about it metaphorically. When looking at the discussions on this subreddit and doing my own research, it seems that Naraka is *very* real.

I've had a thought in my mind about Naraka for a long time. I imagined a place where I would go through all of infinity as my ego. I would live through every actual ***and*** potential reality, but I would stay as my ego. I also had the thought that it wasn't never ending, but if I experience everything through my ego, it might as well be.

I've definitely done righteous things in my life but I've also done so much wrong. I'm addicted to alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine. I've also been ignoring my calling to join a Monastery and become a Buddhist. I feel like I will go to this Naraka if I continue to ignore it.

I'm scared I will be rejected from Monasteries due to having psychosis in the past. I'm also desperately trying to tell myself that it's not real. The cycle continues to tear at my soul.

I go back and forth between believing this Hell and not believing it. Some days, I tell myself it's ok. I'll be fine for a week before the thought comes back. I just wish I could wish it all away.

TLDR; I know my calling and I fear Naraka is in my future if I continue to ignore it. I'm scared I will be rejected from Monasteries due to psychosis. Sometimes, I don't even believe in it anymore and I get confused. What do I do?",Buddhism,1704031278.0,t3_18v8d3v,0.4,0

I feel ashamed like being in mid20s but haven't worked for over a year feeling stuck and confused then ever before. I don't know what to do. This year is already ended and new year will being but I still haven't figured out a plan for a new beginning. I definitely want to improve and make a change but keep that consistent flowing. This year didn't go well and I just felt like I'm living in this rut. 
I only worked so far in fast food and retail jobs. It was okay I guess. I didn't enjoy it or felt like I'm learning anything new to leverage for better opportunities. I didn't take classes consistently this year because whatever I plan to study is giving the fear of Ai taking over someday. Then I have no backup plan to depend on.

Life/health changes as an opportunity to learn non-attachment,"I've recently developed a health condition that includes chronic pain and lots of diet restrictions. I was vegan already so it's cut down my diet when I didn't have much wiggle room to begin with.

This all started within the past 5 months or so. One day I was a healthy young adult and the next day I started having different symptoms. I never realized how much I took for granted being healthy, young, and having my body just ""work.""

I recently got a new therapist. I'm going to start doing some DBT with her and RAIN practices from Tara Brach. I want to use this as an opportunity to find refuge in my Buddhist practice as well. I figure my only options are to either be upset and neurotic about it or try to use it in a positive way. I've got a lot of anger, sadness, and loss right now. I keep thinking about when I was healthy and didn't know that soon everything would become a lot harder. I wish I would've appreciated what I had then.

But then I started thinking about it more. I felt like everything was unfair because I ""shouldn't"" be unhealthy. As soon as I thought that, I remembered that this is samsara; suffering is to be expected. This is ""normal"" for samsara. I'm still struggling a lot, but having that thought made things a bit easier to accept. I'm not owed anything, least of all a healthy body. There's nothing to fight against because this isn't out of the ordinary.

I'm going to have to switch to mostly making things from scratch with not that much flavor. I'm also going to try cutting out sugar too. Besides that, this severely impacts my sex life; I haven't been intimate with my partner or masturbated in months. Losing those sources of pleasure and indulgence has been extremely difficult. It's also made me realize how much I relied on such things to find happiness.

I'm not sure if or when I will get better. I want to develop a practice so that whether I do or not, I will be okay.

"If one exclusively recites nembutsu, Amida Buddha will certainly come to welcome this individual into the Pure Land in accordance with the principle of naturalness.","
‚ÄúThe good person should recite nembutsu just as he is, as should the bad person. We regard faithful people, who repeat nembutsu with a mind as pure as the day they were born, as those who do not require additional support in nembutsu. If the bad rectify their misdeeds, become good, and recite nembutsu, they will truly be in harmony with the heart of Amida Buddha. On the contrary, those who are unable to attune themselves to the heart of Amida Buddha and who are unable to be resolute in their faith in birth in the Pure Land will most certainly not attain birth in the Pure Land.‚Äù

*D≈çk≈ç‚Äôs note: This is based on quotations from the Collection of Dialogues on Nembutsu.
H≈çnen-sh≈çnin once said, ‚ÄúThere exists the principle of naturalness. Flames rise skyward, water flows downward. Some fruits are sour, some are sweet. These truths are governed by the principle of naturalness. The essential vow of Amida Buddha promises that his name is the means to save the most evil mortals. It is, therefore, obvious that if one exclusively recites nembutsu, Amida Buddha will certainly come to welcome this individual into the Pure Land in accordance with the principle of naturalness.‚Äù

Is it ok to be ok with not achieving enlightenment in this lifetime?,"For all of us, the goal is to eventually achieve spiritual liberation. But for most of us, most of us don‚Äôt see ourselves becoming fully enlightened Arhats (Theravada) or fully enlightened Buddhas (Mahayana) in this lifetime alone. It got me thinking, why am I a Buddhist if I don‚Äôt have the specific goal to become awakened in this lifetime? And I think it‚Äôs because honestly, the Buddhist teachings just resonate with me. 
It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt want to be an arhat or a Buddha in this lifetime, it‚Äôs just I don‚Äôt see it happening. As far as I can tell I have a lot of work before attaining stream entry at the very least. I can see myself making that a reasonable goal for myself at the end of this life time-to attain stream entry, and maybe a higher level of realization if I become a monk.

I think at the end of the day, it‚Äôs about having a goal to work on. Something to keep us going, and something to give us answers in this difficult world of samsara that we live in, and to hopefully, eventually reach the end of the path to liberation. 

I‚Äôm fine with either being reborn in another lifetime, either as a human or a deva, and continuing the practice of Dhamma there. Maybe my time will come when the future Buddha arrives, and more people will become enlightened in that age to come?",Buddhism,1703913078.0,t3_18u7nt5,0.94,64

What is some advice you could give about dealing with being hated and considered a fool?,"I have a lot of bullies who jeer at me and ridicule me mercilessly, even though I keep to myself. Yesterday, someone called me something that wasn't even true, but the gall and the hatred of the person stuck with me like time delayed poison. I didn't retaliate, but as soon as I got home I stewed in anger for hours and felt ill. I think of the metaphor of someone with an arrow in their back being grateful for that and how it's a blessing in disguise. But at times I feel more arrow than human. 

I was rereading a book by Pema Chodron and one passage stuck out. There was a tough guy who had an epiphany when he found a man who wasn't afraid of being a fool.

New Person - Trying to find a center in Syracuse NY,"Hi.  I know very little about Buddhism and I'm looking to find out more in the Syracuse NY or Central NY area.  

I live in the Syracuse NY area and only found a couple places.  The first I talked to was a Zen Buddhist temple in the suburbs.  I know even less about Zen.  My impressions was the place was for a upper middle class, well off clientele.  Most people were professionals, similar ethnic and socioeconomic background.  Nice, but there was an air of, don't know how to describe it, entitled - monied.  

People were kind of dismissive about basic information, maybe it was just who I talked to.  There website states they want you to tithe 10% of your annual income to them.  I don't mind making donations, but they also charge for 'classes'.  I never heard of this kind of request from friends who long time Buddhists.  Not judging, just took a mental note - the interactions left a less than enthusiastic vibe - so I guess this isn't the place for me.  

I am financially well off, but I find emphasis on money and spirituality don't mix well.  I got sober many decades ago, suffer from depression and anxiety (money hasn't helped much in the mental health dept).  I just want to find some peace even if it comes to doing things online vs in person.

[PERSONAL OPINION] How Karma and Rebirth cannot be seperated and must be accepted together.,"# Ever thought why you're borned the way you are? 

Ever thought why some people are borned rich, some are born poor, some are born in a specific country, some are born in a new continent, some are born smart, some are born 'silly'?  


People always say ""This is a test from xxx, life is YOLO"", I personally disagree. It is weird that if life is 'YOLO (you only live once)', then it is unfair that everyone is so uniquely different and unfairly 'created'.

Why are people in the poorer countries suffering while people in rich nations are enjoying life?

&#x200B;

Such 'unfairness' just cannot answer and logically prove 'YOLO'. Hence comes the rebirth doctrine.

> **Rebirth** in [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism) refers to the teaching that the actions of a sentient being lead to a new existence after death, in an endless cycle called [*sa·πÉsƒÅra*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra). 

In all schools of Buddhism, rebirth is accepted as a core belief. In Buddhism, we believe there is infinite life before us, and after us, where we will be reborn in the [six realms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Paths), unless we are liberated from [samsara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra) (which is what most Buddhist is aiming for). Rebirth works logically, when one create a [Karma (kamma)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma_in_Buddhism) in this life, last life, it will 'consolidate' together and with the aid of the last thought in life before death, will result in the reborn of one in next life. (Read Mindfulness of Death, [MOD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/18246rr/mindfulness_of_death_mod/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3))

The three miserable realms are full of suffering and the three upper realms although suffer less, is still filled with suffering. This suffering will repeat continously until one finally get liberated from samsara.

However, due to everyone's unique karma, they are reborn in different type of places and classes. This makes sense.   

**The King of Concentrations Sutra says:** 

>**You will obtain a result similar To the kinds of karma you do.** 

This will lead you to your next rebirth, and you get the fruit you planted one day. This explains why rebirth and karma cannot be mutually exclusive. To reject rebirth, is the same as rejecting karma, to reject karma is the same as rejecting rebirth. To claim rebirth is non evidental is to claim karma is non evidental, and the vice versa. It is a wrong view to make such claims.

It is also silly to reject rebirth or karma concept because it does not fit to your own belief, remember the Second nobles truth states we are suffering because of our ignorance to Dharma. Instead of strongly rejecting, refuting karma and rebirth, we should look at how we can make our life better. If we are poor, if we are sad, then let us find ways to make it better, plant more good karma seed and let it ripe, **PRACTICING THE DHARMA** and the Noble Eightfold Path is the way to help us have better karmic seeds.

Just because we have a bad life should not mean that we reject karma and rebirth, we should look for ways to make life better, not to develop ego and say rebirth and karma is wrong.

This is a personal opinion and my own takeaway from Karma and Rebirth, of course there is more to karma but it is how it is linked to rebirth. Buddhist doctrines are interlinked, we should not seperate them and make them an independent identity and argue the heck out of it.

Please correct me if there is any wrong ideas in my opinion.

Numbers with (?) Are estimate counts from a session. (Number) behind each mantra count is the exact amount I did prior to the formal count I started now, but ? With that number means it is a VERY rough estimate.

(12,500?) Chenrezig mantra count: 108 + 65(?) +

(10,000?) Green Tara mantra count:

(1) 35 Buddha Confession sessions count:

Milarepa mantra count:

(1,000?) Manjushri mantra count:

(250?) 7 line prayer count:

(1,500?) Vajra Guru mantra count:

(20?) Ch√∂d session count:

(20?) Lotsawa house prayers count (1): 
1 (Dedication of Merit from the Profound Aural Transmission of the Sky-Dharma Mind Treasure's VajravƒÅrƒÅhƒ´ Cycle (DoMftPATotS-DMTVC)) +

Random sites prayer count (1): 
1 (jigten sumgon's dedication prayer (JSDP)) +

I want to be able to create mantra count categories as shown above, and have an automatic accumulation system so I don't have to do the math.

Bonuses if one can add estimate numbers, and notes per accumulation session but these functions are not necessary.

NKT Warning - New Kandampa Tradition,"Just wanted to talk about my experience with the NKT. The only Meditation center in my town. I was completely unfamiliar with the controversy surrounding the organization but it all started to make sense after. I had a wonderful meditation there and met a beautiful elderly woman who led me through a very nice meditation, but throughout the whole conversation it seemed like the members were learning more from me. They had so many strange dogmas and dogmatic beliefs i didn‚Äôt understand and i could see these strange worships of very specific deities as confusing and downright bad. Just wanted to warn people about that. At one point one of the converts even told me that i could be an incarnation of the buddha or one with the buddha nature because of the things i was saying. Which was very nice of her but I think it‚Äôs one thing to understand everything being one with buddha-nature and downright just calling someone an incarnate of buddha. if i am buddha so is she and so is everyone, but that wasn‚Äôt what she was saying. which scared me. because now learning about their worship of a said ‚Äúdemon‚Äù specific entity i could see the way in which the converts were projecting outward for a savior. believing that their worship of the right specific deity or lineage would be ‚Äúright‚Äù. I write this to help get the true teachings to these people. I pray they can find peace and clarity too see through these illusions. Namaste",Buddhism,1703878916.0,t3_18tvhvn,0.85,41

books for a newer buddhist?,"i've been loosely into buddhism for 2-3 years now, maybe 4. buddhism has always resonated with me more than anything else, though i've never dove into it deeply. i've been between it, atheism, and agnosticism for quite a while. i want to learn and try my best to apply buddhism to my life, especially with this upcoming year. i am mostly asking for books i could learn from, specifically beginner level as i know there is a lot of depth to buddhism. i want to learn about siddharta, goals and achievements of buddhism, the gods, living as buddhist, etc. if you all have any book recommendations, that would be nice . :) if it helps, i am more casual than traditionalist - though i would enjoy learning about tradition, i am not as strict now as i may be later in life.

i was also wondering, even if i don't specifically believe in the gods, is it still okay to follow buddhism? of course i'd still apply respect to them, perhaps with learning i may think about them more, though i've been athiest most of my life which is why im asking.

Would it be considered disrespectful to write a poem from the perspective of Tara,"Hello everyone :)

Yesterday, a strange thing happened. I was working on a poem but i was also browsing information about Tara, Green Tara meditation etc. But then it was almost like Tara herself or her energy had enterend the space or I had someway felt her energy. I can't explain the feeling but there was joy and probably some sort of sense of peace. I smiled in a sort of joyful yet gentle way, the type of smile on perhaps a buddha statue or on a depiction of Tara. And a part of me kinda started to view the poem i had been working on as comforting words coming from Tara or something of the sort.

Should I continue the poem from Tara's perspective? and would that be considered disrespectful? I'm genuinely unsure because I mean no disrespect or mockery towards Tara- in fact, her energy is beautiful to me.

Edit: I emailed  **Dhamma Sukha Meditation Center about this and asked for consultation from a master or teacher and this was their response:**

""Our opinion would be this was more about faith and joy arising about something. Not a meditation insight or realization. This comes from the letting go of tanha or craving in some way.""

Liberation & Thoughts/Beliefs,"The further *I* head into realisations along the path, the more it becomes apparent that a lot of awakening/liberation pertains to disidentifying with thought, and subsequently dissolving beliefs‚Äìbeliefs are ultimately just another thought that is disguised as something else and largely hidden from consciousness. It has become clear that the quantity or potency of beliefs that someone has about themselves and the world, is inversely correlated with the freedom from suffering.

Some notable beliefs that many people have while being largely unconscious and wrapped up in egoic mind patterns and existence include;

\- I am here and the world is out there- I am separate from the senses

\- Time and distance exist as a thing

\- One side cannot be both sides

\- It's important to have strong beliefs about things because it makes me human and strong

There are obviously many more, and obviously not all beliefs crucially need investigating. For example, thinking that it's important to floss in the morning as a belief.

The phrase 'If you meet the Buddha on the road, slay the Buddha' directly points to the notion of dissolving beliefs. It's an important reminder that the Buddha pointed beyond himself, beyond Buddhism, and beyond all doctrine.",Buddhism,1703942067.0,t3_18ufegi,0.5,0
"'The Sapta≈õatikƒÅ (700 line) Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ S≈´tra states that through the ‚ÄòSingle Deed Samadhi‚Äô one can quickly attain enlightenment: Concentrate their minds on a Buddha, and recite his name single-mindedly.''","Namo Amituofo üôèüèª

Those good men or good women who wish to enter the Single Deed
Samadhi should live in seclusion, cast away discursive thoughts, not cling to the
appearances of things, concentrate their minds on a Buddha, and recite his name
single-mindedly. They should keep their bodies erect and, facing the direction of
that Buddha, meditate upon him continuously. If they can maintain mindfulness of
the Buddha without interruption from moment to moment, then they will be able
to see all the Buddhas of the past, present, and future right in each moment. 

Why?
Because the merits of being mindful of one Buddha are as innumerable and boundless
as those of being mindful of countless Buddhas, for the inconceivable teachings
of all Buddhas are identical and undifferentiated. All Buddhas achieve supreme
enlightenment by the same suchness, and all are endowed with incalculable
merits and immeasurable eloquence. Therefore, one who enters the Single Deed
Samadhi knows thoroughly that Buddhas as innumerable as the sands of the Ganges
are indistinguishable in the dharmadhatu.

The Sanskrit title of this is the Sapta≈õatikƒÅ Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ S≈´tra. An alternative English title would be, The Prajnaparamita Sutra in 700 Lines.

Coming to Terms with Who We Truly Are,"Since getting serious about meditation and following the teachings of the Buddha, I've come to realize that I have some flawed character traits that need work. Before this, I was pretty much blind to these flaws; I didn't think I was perfect by any means, but I definitely didn't see things the way I do now. I now see the subtle ways in which I hurt myself and/or others around me, and I'm genuinely working on fixing that now. It's so different with Buddhism though, because I also feel like there's nothing to ""fix""; I just need to get more in tune with my innate goodness and it will all flow the way it should. 

It's different than how I used to practice in the Christian church. Not only did I not see all my flaws, but for the ones that I did notice, I would just beat myself up about them all the time, and I'd never get better. It's like I lived in a constant state of guilt with no way out. Now, thankfully, things are different. I don't feel guilty like I used to; that doesn't mean I don't feel bad when I, for example, hurt someone's feelings or something like that. But I don't carry that weight around anymore. Even though I can see many more flaws now (probably because I'm learning to look deeper into myself and situations), I still feel lighter, and more free. 

Buddhism can help us comes to terms with who we truly are, and while it may be ugly at first, it's nothing to feel bad about. It's about first accepting where you are at, then making a conscious effort to transform that. Through this, I'm learning to let go of guilt and open up to my true nature, which is Buddha nature. It's already there, we just have to open our eyes to it.

Does morality affect the extent to which a person has negative meditative experiences?,"I've learned that morality is an important foundation for training in meditative concentration. 

My understanding was that by training in morality, we create the karma for pleasant states of mind, and purify the karma for unpleasant states of mind. Also, by guarding our morality, we develop the qualities which Shantideva calls watchfulness and carefulness which serve to assist us in the development of concentration. Without morality, I thought, it is more probable that a person will have negative experiences with meditation.

I'm reading a [study](https://www.proquest.com/docview/1416383190?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true&sourcetype=Scholarly%20Journals&imgSeq=11) on Buddhist teacher's experiences with their students' negative experiences of meditation. These teachers (four Theravada, four Zen, and four Tibetan - all out of Colorado) cite reasons for negative meditative experiences that do not include morality. Theravadins related these negative experiences to increased concentration without balanced mindfulness. Zen teachers referenced incorrect posture and breathing. Tibetan teachers referenced improper execution of advanced meditative techniques leading to hlung disease. But none of them (apparently) discussed moral training. 

Why is that? Is my understanding of the relationship between morality and meditation wrong, or is there another reason that 12 Buddhist teachers didn't mention it?",Buddhism,1703871213.0,t3_18tsi8h,0.82,10

Resources from Tulku Thondup,"In honor of the passing of Tulku Thondup, I wanted to share a few resources from him that have improved my life:

1) His book ""Healing Power of Mind"" is one of the best books on Buddhism and healing that I have read.  He also wrote a really good book called ""Boundless Healing"".[https://www.amazon.com/Healing-Power-Mind-Meditation-Enlightenment-ebook/dp/B00ET924G6/ref=sr\_1\_1?crid=2JI47IEXHHWX2&keywords=healing+power+of+mind&qid=1703870501&s=books&sprefix=healing+power+of+mind%2Cstripbooks%2C149&sr=1-1](https://www.amazon.com/Healing-Power-Mind-Meditation-Enlightenment-ebook/dp/B00ET924G6/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2JI47IEXHHWX2&keywords=healing+power+of+mind&qid=1703870501&s=books&sprefix=healing+power+of+mind%2Cstripbooks%2C149&sr=1-1)

3) His book ""The Heart of Unconditional Love"" is an inspiring guide on how to develop compassion by using visualization of the Buddha of Compassion - Avalokiteshvara.  In the book, he adapts traditional Tibetan mind training into a system that he feels will work for almost everyone -  the book is a systematic training program to develop one's mind based on Tibetan mind training techniques.  I would only recommend the book for someone looking for a training program; it is a system of training utilizing visualization of deities, not just a simple book on loving kindness.

How does Anatta make sense?,"I partially agree with the idea of non-self (Anatta) on that there is no permanent, fixed identity of oneself because of impermanence (Anicca), and I partially agree with the examples related to Anatta in Buddhist books and videos (e.g., chariot, car, the 5 aggregates of oneself). However, I cannot get myself to agree with them fully. I have 2 questions:

1. Why can‚Äôt the idea of ‚Äúimpermanent self‚Äù or ‚Äúdynamic self‚Äù exist? It seems to me that Anatta states that ‚ÄúI‚Äù do not exist because ‚ÄúI‚Äù am always changing, but why can‚Äôt an existence be dynamic and changing in the first place?
2. It is true that each part of an existence cannot represent the identity of that existence, but I fail to see why they cannot represent an identity once structured in a specific way. Why can‚Äôt one identity be an aggregate of multiple components and exist in that way? For example, it is true that ‚ÄúI‚Äù am not any of my 5 aggregates, and it is true that all my 5 aggregates are always changing, but why cant ‚ÄúI‚Äù be an aggregate of my 5 changing aggregates?

"Isolated and struggled for most of my life, how can I gain the strength to practice?","I've lived a very isolated life born into an oppressive Christian cult, my options for interacting with other human beings, aside from my parents who verbally and mentally abused me everyday, were limited. I wasn't allowed to make friends who were not a part of this cult so that meant I wasn't allowed to form connections with schoolmates. I was then homeschooled in my teen years and the only friends I had moved away to serve in a different church, and that's when my deepest isolation began. This has caused me never ending pain and scarred me to the point that I am now unable to form any connection or care about people deeply. Any new people in my life leave just as quick as they appeared. I know about impermanence, yet I continually struggle with the thought that anything that brings a semblance of joy or comfort after dealing with so much pain is only temporary. I've formed too many attachments in order to cope with these feelings, my health is now suffering because of it, and I feel unmotivated to do anything, including to practice. I've tried therapy, gone to many therapists, but I'm unable to speak frankly with them and they tell me things I already know.

I want to practice Buddhism but I fear I may never overcome my pain and isolation and I'll just continue to descend further and further into my attachments.

Is it possible to have goals and ambitions without clinging and attachment?,"As we're coming up to the new year, I'm sure many of us have resolutions, goals and ambitions we want to strive for in 2024 - but is it possible to strive for goals without attachment? 

I've been mulling over this questions for a few days. It's easier to understand how ""ambitions"" based in overtly worldly materialism (e.g. ""I want to buy 5 bugattis"") can lead to suffering as we understand that material goods are temporary and joy they provide is surface and fleeting. But what about goals that are adjacent to spiritual ambitions? For example, one of my goals for 2024 is to move home - primarily for the sake of having a stable living situation that allows for better focus on my spiritual and creative practice. Does this differ at all from desiring impermenant and material goods that only bring fleeting joy?

Is ambition compatible with the Buddhas teachings? Does it depend on the circumstance and reasoning behind said ambition? Or is ambition always tied up in suffering, the impermenance and pain of gains and losses?

Inspiring Story of Chanting Buddha 33 - The woman in white delivers medicine in her dream ÁôΩË°£Â•≥‰∫∫Â§¢‰∏≠ÈÄÅËó•,"(English and Chinese subtitles )Âøµ‰ΩõÊÑüÊáâË¶ãËÅûË®ò ,  written by venerable laywoman Kanzhi Lin ÊûóÁúãÊ≤ªÂ±ÖÂ£´ (1906-1992 AD) Subtitles:  The dharma of chanting Buddha's names is simple and suitable for men and women, young and old, rich and poor, as long as they are convinced that Buddha is the teacher of the three realms and the loving father of all beings. Those who have faith in Buddha and chant Buddha will be able to eliminate serious sins and obtain abundant blessings. Here are some facts to prove the point.  In about 1957, there was a small family that moved to the north district of Taichung from the suburb.  The host was Mr. Chen, and his wife is Jiao Lin, who had been sick for a long time in her hometown. Although the eldest son, Zhong, was only eight years old, he was a decent child, knowing to serve soup and medicine, and never left his mother's side.  One day, Sister Gold Twig, the leader of the chanting buddha class, went to their home. She saw Jiao lying on the bed, moaning in a state of terminal illness. The child, Zhong, was weeping at his mother's side. When Gold Twig saw it, her compassion arose spontaneously and said to Jiao,  ""Jiao, you must chant. the holy name of Avalokitesvara, the Bodhisattva of Salvation, and pray for recovery soon.  At this point, Jiao whispered, ""I can't chant.""  Gold Twig said, ""You can't chant, it's the same if your children chants for you. You only have to listen quietly and follow the chanting in your heart.‚Äù Gold Twig then invited a picture of the Three Saints of the West, mounted in a mirror frame and hung it on the opposite wall of Jiao's bed.  Then she taught Zhong to put palms together and chant the holy names of Amitabha Buddha and Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva.  This child is very smart and learned it soon. After he had chanted for two hours, she taught him to transfer the merit and pray to the Buddha and Bodhisattva to bless his mother with good health soon.  He could follow all the teachings and often pray before the Buddha devoutly.  With the majestic picture in front of her eyes and the holy names of the great virtue beside her ears, Jiao felt she had support in her heart.  It is inconceivable to recite the holy names of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. The boy, Zhong, prayed to Buddha for his mother's recovery every day. Within a week, a miracle happened.  He called out happily early one morning, ""Mom, Last night I dreamed that a woman dressed in white took a handful of herbs as long as leek and gave them to you. You received them in your hand and put them in your mouth. I saw that distinctly. He also told me that he was Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, if my mother took this herb, she would be safe.""  On hearing that, Jiao felt astonished and told her child: Zhong, I also dreamt that a woman took a handful of long herbs and asked me to eat them. I chewed the herbs in my mouth and swallowed them. When I woke up in the morning, my mind was clear, and I felt my symptom much lighter.  Hence, Jiao's illness returned to health day by day, and mother and son shared the joy of family.  Zhong had planted good roots in his little heart. So every day before going to school, he would always take leave of the Buddha and bow with his palms together, saying, ""Amitabha, I am going to school.""  When coming back home from school, he would always go to the Buddha, with his palms together, bowed and said, ""Amitabha, I am back."" He did that every day and was accustomed to it.",Buddhism,1703814660.0,t3_18tb15p,0.72,3

How is clinging/attatchment the cause of suffering?,"Hey everyone. I apologise if this is kinda emotional for me. I mean no disrespect to Buddhism, it's precepts and in fact, i consider myself a buddhist.

Buddhism teaches that the cause of suffering is clinging/attatchment. And in certain scenarios, perhaps this could make sense. But I just kinda struggle to see this being put to my case. I was abused as a child by my father and even after the physicial abuse stopped, in the past like two years, I've had a tough relationship with him and even have found myself yearning for a father and his affection. And it's tough for me to explain this suffering I've felt with attatchment because isn't it kinda expected for a young person to be attatched and reliant on his father? Is the role of the father not to love the child and show him affection and take care of him. There is much wisdom in the concept of attatchment causing suffering, but in this case where my father hasn't treated me that well and it's caused me pain, how even today i have this yearning for a father figure and that affection, how would such suffering have been caused by attatchment?

&#x200B;

What is the Buddhist antidote to suffering - or your personal antidote?,"Hi all, 

I have been in a rather depressed state lately, and unfortunately, when I am in this frame of mind, it clouds everything. Today I went out with family to eat, I had a good time, but internally, thoughts popped into my mind, my grandma is in hospital, my parents are aging, everybody I love in this life will die, I was looking and smiling at my parents who were enjoying their time, but yet my thoughts dwelled on their mortality.

This frame of mind can render me ineffective in functioning with day to day concerns.

Looking for recommendations for retreats/volunteering,"Dear community, I am looking for an authentic experience in a Buddhist monastery as a Western woman, to deepen my understanding of Buddhist teachings and personal practice. There are a lot of retreats online that seem to be more part of the Western wellness trend, which is not what I am looking for. I was already a few times in Silent Retreats here in Europe, which was a very profound experience, yet I feel that I need something more. For me personally, living a simple life would surely contribute to my personal growth. I have seen a few pages where they allow Westerners to live in monasteries and support the community by teaching English, which I find a very interesting concept because I would have the chance to give something back to the people I learn from.

"Buddhists, how close to love is silence of the mind?","I'm starting to understand something.

Correct me if I'm wrong,

Buddhism diesnt offer us answers, it doesn't seem to overcome suffering, provide answers to the deepest questions all conscious agents have.

It looks to detatch from answers, not to avoid them.

But I I believe buddhism is a state of mind for many, where we realise despite all suffering, inadequacies of the self, failures, imaginations questions, wonderings, what ifs, consequences, judgements, fears, hatred and abandonments, are not to be solved but to be integrated, understood and FRAMED.

I believe buddhism is not an ignorance of these answers, but a deep, profound realisation that the answers are beyond our human understanding. And in this realisation, comes a loving trust with oneself, that despite our limitations and lack of control, we look to detatch, not because we have given up, but we have given in...given in to our own way of navigation, as our natural reverance to what is not necessary.


It is a detachment for the need of answers...so that the questions may be asked without the answers needing to be told...

There is no doubt we are limited.. but we may find limitless in avenues we provide for ourselves.

Dhamma: The law of Nature,"Dhamma (Buddha's teaching) is divided into two groups : Mundane teaching (lokika Dhamma) and Supra-Mundane teaching (lokottara Dhamma).

Billions of humans live in the samsara. Few of them live in the Nirvana. So the mundane teaching is more important and necessary than the Supra-mundane teaching in terms of human well-being and happiness and peace and harmony in the world.

Of course, there is no alternative to the Supra-Mundane teaching or the Vinaya Pitaka and the Abhidhamma Pitaka if someone wants to understand and practise Dhamma (both mundane and Supra-Mundane) deeply and realise a happy life in the samsara as well as a blissful life the Nirvana.

I struggle a lot with gender dysphoria and suicidal thoughts on a daily basis, and have tried transitioning which doesn't seem to help all that much.  As far as I've observed, Buddhism as it's practised where I am (Thailand), seems to focus a lot on karma (an action in one's past life resulted in consequences in their present life) and atonement especially for one's better next life.

Please correct me if I'm mistaken, but I can't help but feel the idea of reincarnation encourages suicide.  I mean, if I could unalive myself with a guarantee I'd reincarnate as a cis woman, I would.  Or even if I'd experience no reincarnation or suffering after death, I'd probably do it too, and have considered many times.  However, isn't this all ... counterproductive?  Is this really all there is to life for someone with lifelong disorders?  Would love to hear more your thoughts on this!",Buddhism,1703708770.0,t3_18sa93w,0.81,10

Does emptiness not imply futility and meaninglessness?,"Little context for my question: About 2 years ago I started going down an existential crisis brought about by pondering the nature of material reality. Specifically the realization that everything around me, as well as ""me"" is just atoms and sub-atomic particles bouncing around in phsyical and chemical interactions. Me saying ""I love you"" to my romantic partner is just my vocal cords vibrating, that vibration traveling through air and her brain releasing oxytocin. I started to not see beauty, enjoyment, meaning, value in things. Just cold, dead particles bouncing around, in a constant neutral stream of cause and effect. I started to not see animals, plants and people, just cells, tissues mechanically moving around in space. Even the anxiety and depression this caused me was just neural electric activity and my brain releasing cortisol. I remember watching Jaak Panksepp's ted talk on the science of emotions and being baffled at how scientists, specifically neuroscientists can find value and meaning in empathy, love and joy when their life's work is studying how those experiences are nothing but soulless particles moving around in their brain, not much differently from a computer. If I don't believe in a soul, a creator God, or anything of the sort, then it really doesn't ""matter"". I could live, I could die, anyone could live, anyone could die, being alive vs dead is really just your brain actively producing electrical activity or not. No inherent value or purpose. Just nothing.

Recently I started reading up on stoicism, taoism and buddhism, all of which seem to have a much more materially focused and less human-centric view of the universe (as opposed to my protestant christian upbringing), and specifically the idea of emptiness in Buddhism seemed very much similar to the ideas which cause me so much existential despair. There's no ""self"", no ""things"" independently identifiable from each other. The weird thing however, is that despite all this, buddhism still teaches love and compassion for things and that we can overcome suffering. I find it very strange and intruiging how seemingly I ""realized"" or thought about the same things that buddhists did and yet they came to much less pessimistic conclusions as to what to do with that knowledge and what to do in life in general. 

So, my question is, how? How is recognizing emptiness not causing buddhists all over the world and history to just... give up on everything? How can buddhists find value in compassion, service and the reduction of suffering if in the end it's all empty and there's no supreme ""good"" or meaning to life or the universe? Maybe I am completely misunderstanding these concepts, or reality itself, in which case any help bringing me closer to the truth would be appreciated.

"""Veiled Silence: A Elegy for the Lost Panchen Lama""","In the sacred tapestry where Buddhas reside,
Panchen Lama, a beacon, our spiritual guide.
Guardian of wisdom, a radiant soul,
His absence casts shadows, takes a heavy toll.

Beneath Himalayan peaks, where prayers ascend,
Panchen Lama's teachings, a timeless blend.
A lighthouse of compassion, a vessel of peace,
In the vast Tibetan plateau, his influence won't cease.

Oh, Panchen Lama, held in unseen chains,
Release his spirit from karmic constraints.
In the scrolls of Dharma, his wisdom inscribed,
A plea for his freedom, compassion derived.

As prayer flags flutter in the mountain air,
We beseech the heavens, a solemn affair.
Grant him liberation, let his spirit soar,
Restore the balance, like waves on the shore.

Through mandalas spun with devotion's thread,
A tapestry woven, where hopes are spread.
May the Lotus-born Lama find his way,
Back to the faithful, where serenity may sway.

In temples adorned with saffron and gold,
Echo the chants, the stories retold.
Panchen Lama, a jewel in Buddhism's crown,
Release his essence, let compassion abound.

From Lhasa to Leh, let the mountains resound,
A chorus of prayers, with compassion profound.
In the cosmic dance, where destinies twine,
Free the Panchen Lama, let his light shine.

This is my first post here, so please be kind to me :D

&#x200B;

I started to practise Buddhism few months ago. I really enjoy meditating every single day, for 10 minutes, it brought so much peace and happiness in my life. But the reason why I'm writing this post is because, there are certain individuals at my workplace that are REALLY toxic, they use vulgar language very often, as well as aggressive behavior, through words and actions, like ridiculing someone, laughing at someone, treating specific person like someone stupid. Among those individuals is THAT one, 35 years old, short single guy (let's say his name is Luke), he is very aggressive, using perverted, explicit and vulgar language, he acts like a macho, always threating anyone with a beating, he boasts off to anyone, that he pays prostitutes for sex. He always got on my nerves, irritating me with his obscene and immature behavior, he ridiculed me many time, insulting me, calling me ""Chechen"", and recently, he started insulting me again, calling me ""Conchita"", like that Austrian drag queen from Eurovision Song Contest, just because I have a beard, and everyone seemed to support his foolish behavior, about insulting me and laughed at me too. I was really fed up with his behavior and started to ignore him completely, I stopped talking to him, treating him, like he didn't even exist, and since he is a kind of person that loves attention and likes to make a drama, to get attention, he said that I'm ""f\*cked up"", because I don't answer to his insults and stupid behavior. 

I noticed that there is not even a single person at my workplace that I can talk with, everyone seem to be really treating me like I was some idiot, even though I try to talk to them nicely and politely, because I'm quiet calm and reserved person, as introvert.

So, what should i do with situation, should I definitely ignore them and don't talk with them at all? if my boss tells me to work with them, should I say no or just work with them and be silent? How should I act, when I'm confronted by toxic people, not only at my workplace, how should I behave around them?

My understanding of the world from Buddhism point of view,"There are two types of phenomena, permanent and impermanent.

Permanent phenomena may and may not exist forever. But it won't change at all, and won't be caused by other phenomena.

There are three types of impermanent phenomena: form, mind and non-associated. Form, in the other word, physical, like planet, food etc. Mind, in the other word, consciousness or mental. Non-associated, like time, direction, which is not form or mind.

Looking at a person. Person, itself, is a non associated phenomenon, because it's not form or mind. It has five aggregates: form, sensation, perception, formation and consciousness. In the other angle, earth, water, fire, wind, space and mind.

To connect two angles together, four elements: earth, water, fire and wind are form. Space itself is a permanent phenomenon. Mind includes sensation, perception, consciousness and part of formation.

The most important part of a person is the mind. It includes almost four aggregates. It is sort of indivisible in certain points of view. One person's mind won't become two persons' mind. Two persons' minds won't combine into one mind. It's not a function of form(physical phenomena) while form may impact the mind. So the mind is not a function of the brain, while the brain may impact the mind. For example, if there is some brain disease, the mind may behave differently.

In another point, the mind is divisible. At one point of time, the mind can be divided into multiple pieces, like sensation, perception and so on. For example, if people see a beautiful picture, their point of the mind includes the view of the picture, enjoy or not enjoy the picture, name the picture and so on. From time series, one mind can be divided into many moments of mind.

Characteristics of mind are clear and knowing. It's different with four elements of form. That's why form is not the main cause of mind. Cause of mind is the previous moment of mind. There is no antidote for mind. It's why there are previous and next lives. That's why people grow, and eventually die in one life.

I'm wondering why in the Theravada Vinaya, a nun concealing another nun's parajika entails expulsion (see https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6/en/brahmali), but a monk concealing another monk's grave offense merely entails confession (see https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc64/en/brahmali)

In both origin stories, the concealed offense is grave (sex, a parajika, in the nuns' case, and masturbation, a sanghadisesa, in the monks' case), but only in the nuns' case is the concealer of the grave offense also expelled.

Bhikkhuni Parajika 6 explicitly covers only offenses entailing expulsion, while Bhikkhu Pacittiya 64 covers both offenses warranting expulsion and suspension.

On the one hand this seems to imply that if a nun concealed another nun's offense entailing mere suspension, this would not be an offense at all, whereas for a monk it would be an offense entailing confession. 

On the other hand, it is explicit that if a monk conceals another monk's offense entailing expulsion, this would only be an offense entailing confession, whereas for a nun it would entail expulsion, which does not seem fair!

I know that the Buddha only made rules if someone first performed the act in question (hence why there is always an exception for the first offender) but I don't think that explains why he didn't limit Bhikkhu Pacittiya 64 only to concealing offenses entailing suspension.

The bare fact is, if a monk conceals another monk's parajika, he need only confess so, but if a nun conceals another nun's parajika, she is expelled.

Hopefully I don't offend anyone when I say I'm pretty convinced that many parts of the Vinaya were added after the time of the Buddha, by people who were not free of mental afflictions. I've read the discussions of some scholars who reject the historicity of the eight garudhammas, and I am inclined to agree, but I think it would also explain a lot if the rules here were not in fact implemented by the Buddha as tradition holds.

Unless I'm mistaken, there's not yet any English translation of the Mulasarvastivada Vinaya, but I am hoping to find out if there are parallel infractions there as well.",Buddhism,1703643284.0,t3_18rp3qx,0.75,6
"Right Speech, Art, & Music","Hi!


Curious on some Buddhist perspective here.


Art & music that deals with taboo subjects, is this compatible with the dharma?

I once wrote an ‚Äúevil doo wop song‚Äù - it deals with the idea of revenge.

I‚Äôm curious the Buddhist community‚Äôs view on how art and creativity would fall under right speech, etc. 

If there is no intention to cause harm, but also no moralizing in the song, so not entirely a parable -

Is it a good thing to have art that wakes people up to their shadow? Is it immoral and sowing discord?

Adi Shankaracharya debate [Serious],"Hello there, I'm new to Buddhism. I genuinely want people to answer these questions posted by Sri Adi Shankaracharya while debating with the Buddhists of those era. It is being a philosophical/ideological barrier to me getting into the Buddhism.

Here are the questions:
1. If there is no atman and if existence is really null and void then what is it exactly that reincarnates?

2. Why should one bother about Karma if there is no atman?

3. Beyond death, what controls karma? Is Karma independent or dependent? If nothing supercedes Karma then what makes karma play out?

4. During enlightenment, when one merges with the void, how is one aware of that merger? If there is only one (during merger) then how can that one know another? It needs another to know itself in comparison. Therefore how can the void be ultimate? Because shunya is not aware (had it been aware it wouldn't be shunya)

5. If the void/shunya isn't ultimate then what is it that perceives the shunya? The fifth sheath of human existence (anandamaya kosha) has an observer too, i.e. brahman, beyond shunya. And brahman is eternally aware. Infact, it is awareness itself.

Of Recitation and Response,"### QUESTION: A Facebook user asked, ""Some fellow practitioners can feel a resonance with, or response from, Amitabha Buddha soon after starting to recite his name, while others can't do so even though they have been reciting a long time. Why is that? We all want to survive, but sometimes the tests put to us through sickness are beyond our understanding.""

**MASTER JINGZONG**:  
The practitioner who asked this question is probably suffering from some illnesses, or has a relative or friend who is ill. Someone who has been reciting Amitabha's name for a while expects to feel a resonance with him. When the person fails to get that sort of special experience while seeing others receive it, he or she invariably has doubts and thinks, ""Is Amitabha testing me? Oh, I am so weak and sick. I just want to live. Such a test I cannot withstand.""

1. **Buddhas and Bodhisattvas never test anyone.**  
Facebook is an international medium. The person who asked this question may have been influenced by the Christian faith. In Christianity, there is a concept that ""God is going to test you."" In Buddhism, however, there is absolutely no such thing as ‚Äúthe Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are going to test you."" Buddhas and Bodhisattvas deliver all sentient beings unconditionally. All our sufferings are the manifestations of our own karmic activities in the past. It's as though there is a miracle healer, who can cure any disease. The healer will not impose any condition to test the patient. He heals anyone who goes to him because that is what he is there for.  

2. **If we recite, a resonance will arise; the only factor is whether it is obvious or subtle.**  
Why is it that some reciters can feel some special response while others can't, even after prolonged recitation? In fact, we can all feel a connection. Sometimes it comes to us very clearly, and other times it is more subtle. Most of us only acknowledge the clear signs and ignore the less obvious ones.  

3. **The difference has to do with our roots of virtue from past lifetimes.**  
There is the story of a man who was so hungry that he stuffed himself with seven buns. After the last one, he felt really full and regretted what he had done. He thought to himself, ""I should have just eaten the seventh bun, which filled me up whereas the other six didn't."" Little did he realize that he felt full after the last bun only because he had already eaten the first six.  
Similarly, those who feel a connection quickly can do so because they had a virtuous association with Amitabha in the past of a profound nature. When that link ripens, it manifests itself in an obvious manner, like someone who had eaten six buns and whose recitation in this life resembles the seventh. For those less close to Amitabha in past lives, naturally the present connection will be faint. Some people may not have cultivated enough virtuous roots in the past, and the present recitations are likely to be their first bun. We mustn't stop eating just because we do not feel anything yet. We won't feel full if we stop. We must carry on eating, and reciting.  

4. **The discrepancy has to do with past karmic obstacles.**  
Another factor is the extent of karmicobstructions from past lives. If our past karma is very unwholesome, we willnot be able to feel the same connection with Amitabha Buddha even if we reciteas earnestly as others, and vice versa.  
This is like planting peas in a field. Under the same sunshine and water conditions, the pea that is planted an inch deep in soil will sprout earlierthan one that is one foot under. The buried pea does not get anysun and therefore takes longer to grow above ground. Similarly, ifour bad karma is heavy enough to prevent the seed of our merits fromgerminating, the resonance will come more slowly.  

5. **The variance is linked with our mindset during recitation.**  
If we let go of everything and rely exclusively on Amitabha Buddha, aspiring single-mindedly to be reborn in the Pure Land, the connection will come quickly. However, if we just pray for recovery from illness, with an anxious, expectant and restless delusional mind, rather than with complete reliance on Amitabha, the chances are we will be stuck and unable to link up with him. The feeling of bonding will be weak.  
Take householder Foyue of Weihai, Shangdong, as an example. She was very anxious to recover from cancer after an operation but did not get better. She called me and I said, ""You should not pray for recovery, only for rebirth in the Land of Bliss. Keep this in mind."" She understood at once. ""Yes, that's it!""  
Foyue then said to her husband, ‚ÄúTidy the room up for me, I am going to recite Amitabha‚Äôs name and ask to be reborn in the Pure Land.‚Äù Taken aback, her husband replied, ‚ÄúAre you sure? We should pray for your recovery.‚Äù  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it,‚Äù she said. Her husband thought that she would surely die. But she got better quickly after letting go of everything and single-mindedly reciting with the aim of rebirth in the Pure Land rather than recovery from her illness. This is a clear-cut case.  
On reading your question, I can guess that you are anxious to get better soon. But please try to understand that life is full of suffering and we should just aspire to be reborn in the Land of Bliss. Do not focus on whether you will recover or not. Life is impermanent. We should seek rebirth in the Pure Land as soon as possible, rather than try to drag out our feeble existence, no matter how good this world may seem. If you do not pull through, you will be reborn in the Land of Bliss. And if you are destined to live, you will regain your health soon. Anyway, do not harbor any wishful thinking about getting better. If you do, recitation will not work. Just aspire to rebirth alone, with all your heart.",Buddhism,1703630814.0,t3_18rkkdr,0.79,5

What are we going to do about all these sluts?,"(Nsfw)

&#x200B;

Generally, people like to \[**redacted**\]. It seems though there are some rules about it. The fifth precept is no sexual misconduct, when you go up to eight precepts and beyond into the  it's savakha sangha monastic vinaya into full celibacy.

Does that mean sex is bad?

I encounter a lot of people who think of religion as like a set of rules, like a prison or a school. ""Does Buddhism say X is bad""? ""Are you allowed to x?"" and everything against the rule is bad.

Some Buddhist teachers talk about wisdom beyond good and bad. Beyond differentiation, with realised equanimity.

I think that the reason is that there is a lot of unproductive karmic mental clinging in fixating on the idea of some things as being bad.

I actually think that I picked up some of this from focusing on reading the pali suttas and studying theravada monks. having this idea that sexual desire is a poison of mara here to chain you to the realm of infinite death.

I think basically that the Savakha Monastic path is really remarkable, but it's designed for a specific set of circumstances.

Vinaya in relates not just to this, set of rules for savakha monks. Vinaya also relates to vastness of mind generally, and, in the Vajrayana context, to samaya.

To repair one's samayas is to observe higher and higher vinaya.

So how does this relate to fucking?

I think that we can think of sex as a sort of energetic force or energetic power. A kind of net. that net can be a prison if we relates to this energy with a very impure view. But it is the net of liberation when  it is perceived with pure view.

Remember that the noble eight fold path circles around right view.

And it's very interesting, fascinating actually, to watch from a broad view, the way this energy pattern plays out in the word of appearances.

I live in Hong Kong. I read some research online recently that people in Hong Kong have the least sex in the world. Why don't they have sex?

One relates to excessive work culture. The main religious practice is to be and to seem very busy. This leaves people with little time and energy for engaging in blissful union.

Another relates to oppressive family culture. Generally, families will cockblock each other. They live in tiny apartments with many people and there's no way that your mother and your father and brother and your grandmother are you going to let you bring your beloved in for some midnight pounding when you're off work. And anyway they work 60 hours a week, when would they?

Marriage becomes an economic arrangement surviving overcrowded apartments and unbelievable rent prices, 300 sq feet costing you over 2,000$ a month when a lot of people earn half of this working full time. to buy a tiny box costing over  million us dollars even in an area where people are poor.

There is also a strong British influenced Christian culture and in this case I do think it relates to learned sexual shame.

People really wilt. In a way, our sexual energy is kind of like sunlight, to the budding plant of life that is the human.

I think it closely relates to affection. In this way it is not only sexual contact between genitals but also the giving of affection. It is a need like sunlight.

I have a baby. I can kind of see this clearly. Just like his mindbody has various other needs, food, whatever. has a kind of ""sunlight requirement"" of physical contact, affection. Sometimes I just put my hand on his chest to allow my energy field to mix with his ans ""charge his battery."" Leaves wilt without enough sunlight and people do too.

The need to be touched and charged up with affection does not end when one is a baby. This is a human physical need. But adults have all kinds of rules about touching. They almost never do it.

The hand is kind of a magical tool. If you have some inner sensitivity in the mindbody you will notice all these energetic flows in the world and one of them is through your hands. placing your hands open on someones body is basically a method of traditional medicine.

I think sexual energy can be encompassed in this. If you think about it - the act of sexual union is sort of like a healing therapy. There are all these various ""needs for sunglight"" being met at once. Especially relating to affection and physical contact.

Just lke you water plants, you're watering your consort so she can grow.  Hahahahaha. Why not?

it's kind of a cliche to distinguish making love from fucking, and I don't think it refers to the vigor of thrusting. I think it refers to basically your lovingness. I think people can instinctively feel lovingness and i think being close to it is like a magical healing warmth.

Spiritually profound people can internally generate this warmth, even if they are not receiving it from anyone else. But that does not mean that they won't experience the increase brightness of sharing warmth with another person.

But then, this is something that does not only apply to when you are fucking. You can express a kind of selfless, giving love, at any time. Actually this is the most intimate part of sexual union. And it's actually always there.

Sexual union without any lovingness can be a really defiling and even traumatising thing. To feel ones body objectified and to truly objectify another debases ones sense of integrity.

Thus in actual fact the real bukkake of the act is not in the boning itself but in unlocking a selfless heart of devotion. Nondual lovingness. This is an inner meaning of union.

A truly loving person may bukkake the whole world without even taking their pants off. This is the true indication of profound wisdom.

It often happens, though, that people don't have any occasion to express their affectionate energies in an emotionally healthy way. They have no way to get the sunlight they need to heal and grow. Women, in particular, are imprisoned by their families in a lot of cultures from expressing their needs. If they try to escape, the guards will shoot at them. \*bang\* SLUT! \*bang\* Whore!

I know a lot of women whose mothers called them sluts as little children. They make certain to keep the prison walls as constricting as possible so the child is emotionally anemic. A cultural standard for sexual conservativism is a cover of legitimacy for the intentional psychological vampirism of daughters, within families, including by their mothers, and in society generally.

Men, too, are often taught by fools that to experience mental ease, and to give or receive affection, is fucking gay bro and they squeeze themselves into a complete wreck of rigidity unable to navigate their own emotions with sincerity and relating to people in a disjointed way. There are all kinds of prisons

And people in prison act out of loneliness or sadness or desperation or even cruelty.

People engage in all kinds of predatory sexual activities devoid of lovingness. It's quite harmful.

The nuclear powered nature of sexual energy that can be turned into blissfulness in the presence of lovingness, can also be turned into pain in an environment where one is not emotionally healthy.

I notice a lot of this. I notice in the world that there a lot of men who have a really shockingly predatory approach to dating and courtships and intimacy. There is a way I think of conceiving of ssexual activity as being like an excretion, like taking a shit or a piss. There is an uncomfortable buildup and you ""excrete"" it into some unsuspecting ho. Then you flush and leave. She sort of occupies the emotional role of a lavatory. (Or he, you know, apply your preferred identity roles.)

Addiction to violent porn has become really common. THere is some fucked up shit out there and a lot of people (men in particular) have not the slightest clue how to express their sexuality in a healthy and loving way.

I think that sometimes the best approach for a person and a Buddhist practitioners is not to think about how to chop off their sexual energy, like a gangrenous limb, but perhaps to see it for what it is - a scarce, and actually quite precious energy. It does, in fact, have magical properties. Why else would it be sexual energy that calls life into the world?

Generally - unlocking the real juice of the sexual sauce I think requires the presence of lovingness. Expressing this lovingness kind of requires people to confront the pointless cultural shame about their bodies that most people were taught to have. One will in fact need to defy social customs in order to be happy because the normal custom is to wear heavy chains precisely for no reason.

There is a sexual therapist named Sasha Cobra who I think is really fantastic for talking about a really wise view about sexual health and energy and healing and relationships. She is not formally a Buddhist but if you are watching you will see that she is a Dharma teacher and she is one of the best living dharma teachers for talking about this topic.

Also, Dr. Nida chenadatsang has a book about Karmamudra. However, the human consort practice does require authorisation from a teacher.

Can I think Bhuddism and Christianity are both true?,"I used to be Christian ( kind of,) but I've recently became disillusioned with Christianity due to a lot of things I have learned. I always questioned it but I had a period in my life where I fully believed in it. 

I would ditch Christianity but I've just seen too much that's true about it to completely dismiss it. 

I have recently been researching Bhuddism because I find it interesting and it lines up with a lot of my beliefs ( I believe in the Matrix, I believe time is cyclic and I believe that Bhudda actually escaped The Matrix.) In particular I have researched the story of Mara and Bhudda and it's really inspiring. 

So my question is can Bhuddism and Chirstianity both be true? Can Jesus be some bhuddist monk who was just misunderstood ( I don't buy into any of the Jesus being a god stuff,) and can Mara just be another name for Satan?

It's just painful to see people hallucinating on drugs, claiming some philosophical phenomenas like ""Becoming one with everything"" and stuffs, and then relating it to jhana states during meditation or something.

"The ""superstitious oriental"" : white supremacist fantasies justifying the secular","[I'm back baby](https://imgflip.com/i/3iy9zy)... Happy 2566 from Bangkok :) 

So, this [little interaction](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/108slwv/buddhism_and_mcmindfulness_industry/j3uz5nv/?context=8&depth=9) got me sharing here today. TBH, I've been seeing similar sentiments here for quite a few months, but chose to not say anything. Yet.

As many of you know, I regard [Orientalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientalism_(book)) as a *foundational component* of what drives the domestication, commodification and secularisation attempts of Buddhist religion in the anglosphere. 

When white Buddhists seek to rationalise their pathologising of Buddhist religious practices, you see the same spectre evoked: that of the superstitious, idol worshipping (asian) heathen who refuses the light of truth (in the commenter's case, the ""light"" of secular mindfulness)

Now, we also know that [race essentialism](https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/how-should-educators-and-publishers-eliminate-racial-essentialism/2022-03#:~:text=Racial%20essentialism%E2%80%94the%20belief%20that,prejudice%20and%20diminishes%20their%20empathy) tends to run unchecked in many online platforms, r/Buddhism being no different. To address this in some small way, I want to deconstruct the commenters statement and see what we can find: 

>Ten minutes of secularized mindfulness does more to advance one along the path the Buddha taught than ten minutes of praying to a statue for health and wealth.

So, like a good Protestant Evangelical, he accuses us of ""praying to statues"" for ""health and wealth"". 

But Buddhist icons are not simply dead materials, but representations of the object of our faith: a buddha, bodhisattava, arahant, dhammapala etc. And when we [recollect the qualities of the Lord Buddha](https://www.arrowriver.ca/dhamma/budhsati.html) (or the Triple Gem), *we are in fact, engaged in a form of mental development* (samatha bhavana) as recommended by Lord Buddha himself to monastics and layfolk.

So, knowing this, one must either conclude: our commenter to be ignorant of Lord Buddha's teachings *or knows the teachings* but seems intent on presenting Buddhists as heathen ""idol worshippers"" (who refuse to accept the light of secular mindfulness). I gave him an opportunity to delete his comment, but as the reader can see, he insisted on his position.

Now from an ideological position, as I've said before, *it makes sense that some factions present Buddhists in this fashion*: to position themselves as the acolytes of what Buddhism actually is: a health and wellness regime that be appropriated for neoliberal ends. Any objections come only from the ridiculous who ""worship statues"" who can be safely harangued with impunity.

Presenting the practices of Buddhists in the above fashion is a deeply prejudiced take on a world religion, utterly out of place in 2023. It hinges on outdated constructs of race (like secular b\_ddhism), *rendering people as object*. A tchotchke to pick up, turn over and leer at in disgust and toss aside.

And as I've written before [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/kipjcm/secular_buddhism_and_the_superior_whiteness_of/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/l15dh5/a_closer_look_at_secular_buddhism_and_cultural/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoldenSwastika/comments/mjs9hv/the_secular_buddhist_movement_and_cultural/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoldenSwastika/comments/q9x8m3/buddhism_secularism_and_epistemic_violence/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), the intersection of some of those sympathetic to secularisation and secular enthusiasts are linked to racialised understanding of Buddhist people and their practices. \[In fact we see it in Buddhist revisionist/modernist models as well.\]

You don‚Äôt need to mediate to become enlightened,"Hi, I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts questioning about the differences between full time monks and lay practitioners and questions about enlightenment and Nirvana. I just thought I‚Äôd post to clear up some wrong views. 

First, Nirvana is not a place, it‚Äôs something found through an understanding of the Dhamma. This understanding takes place through the removal of ignorance. The removal of ignorance takes place when you see without cognitive or emotional obscurations. 

There are two things necessary for this. One is that you‚Äôve become sufficiently virtuous. Stream entry can be accomplished with just the five precepts.

The second is the weakening of craving. As craving becomes weaker, your mind becomes more clear, free, and uplifted. This is a mind conducive to insight.

Then you simply examine reality or the five aggregates through the scope of the three marks of existence. Feel free to Google these if you don‚Äôt know them. (I personally like the app ‚ÄúBuddhist Lists‚Äù on iOS) 

When you experientially recognize the four noble truths through this lens, you‚Äôll become weary of the stress and seek a way out. Understanding your mind‚Äôs relationship to the 12 links of dependent origination helps as well. It‚Äôs all about undermining your wrong views. 

Aka where is your mind assuming a ‚Äúself‚Äù where there isn‚Äôt one? (dependent, conditioned things) When you solve this problem you‚Äôll have corrected your view and you‚Äôll then be able attain to stream entry and the knowledges that come with it.

Understanding that there is no self in the five aggregates through investigation into the above paragraphs is all that is required for stream entry.

After this point you don‚Äôt need a teacher as the rest of the path is known. You will likely need mediation afterward to become an arhat (fully enlightened being) since you‚Äôd be looking to uproot very subtle causes of craving.

Mediation is still obviously a beneficial practice considering the investigation, weakening of craving, etc. necessary and mediation benefits everything.

TLDR: The first stage of enlightenment or stream entry only requires an experiential understanding of the four noble truths. After this point you don‚Äôt require a teacher, although one can still be of much benefit.",Buddhism,1650981492.0,t3_ucd6dp,0.49,0

"Can we please stop recommending ""What the Buddha taught""?","In almost every thread where someone new to Buddhism asks what they should read, one of the top responses is ""What the Buddha taught"". It really seems to be a favourite of this subreddit.

I finally took a brief look at it yesterday, and while it seems to contain a very good elaboration about the Four Noble Truths, I also feel it gives a very wrong impression about what Buddhism is, and I've even wondered if it's the ur-text for misinformation about Buddhism.

Chapter 1 opens by saying:

> Among the founders of religions the Buddha (if we are permitted to call him the founder of a religion in the popular sense of the term) was the only teacher who did not claim to be other than a human being, pure and simple. [...]  He was so perfect in his 'human-ness' that he came to be regarded later in popular religion almost as 'super-human'.

That might be literally true, but it also omits that the Buddha *was* super-human. Immediately after the Buddha was born, he took 7 steps and declared that he had arrived as chief of the world, which Buddhists celebrate every year on Vesak. This is true for all branches of Buddhism. Even in the Pali canon, the Buddha performs miraculous deeds.

The book also says a bunch of stuff in the final chapter which I think might be the root of lax Western practice:

> There are no external rites or ceremonies which a Buddhist has to perform.

Again, literally true, but misleading. You don't *have* to perform them. But they are an important part of the religion.

> Of course there are in all Buddhist countries simple and beautiful ceremonies on  religious  occasions.  There  are  shrines  with  statues  of  the  Buddha,  stupas  or dagabas and Bo-trees in monasteries where Buddhists worship, offer flowers, light lamps and burn incense. This should not be likened to prayer in theistic religions; it is only a way of paying homage to the memory of the Master who showed the way.

Only a way of paying homage? I think that would be news to the millions of Buddhists who pay for those shrines, offer those flowers, and take care of those Bo-trees.

> These traditional observances, though inessential, have their value in satisfying the religious  emotions  and  needs  of  those  who  are  less  advanced  intellectually  and spiritually, and helping them gradually along the Path. 

*Less advanced intellectually?!* Okay, this book is now implying that lax practitioners are *smarter* than observant temple-goers. Now I see why Western converts take pride in their laxness.

The book also doesn't mention the Six Realms. From reading this book, you'd have no way of knowing that canonical Buddhist belief involves Gods, Ghosts, or Hell. (There are a couple brief mentions in passing to the Gods, but they aren't explained.) From the way the book derides the concept of God and Hell in Christianity, the reader might likely assume there was nothing analogous in Buddhism, which is incorrect.

I really don't think we should be recommending this book and perpetuating incorrect impressions about Buddhism.

If someone wants a book recommendation, I'd suggest [Popular Deities of Chinese Buddhism](http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/ancientsgrfx.pdf), which is available for free on the internet. (Despite the title, the book also includes a good section on Buddhist teachings, including the six realms, the twelve causes, and the six paramitas.) It's a Mahayana book. If you know any good Theravada or Vajrayana books, feel free to comment.

A Student of Lama Federico Andino & Lama Dorje Sherab Speaks Out,"Hello, I am a Buddhist who joined Tantric Sorcerous Underground a.k.a. Tantric Revolutionary Centre in May 2021. Now that they are going more public, and trying to reach out to more people, I feel it's a good time to speak out about my own experience practicing in this group, and learning under these two Lamas.

A little bit about myself: I am of Vietnamese descent, and of course my first exposure to Buddhism would be to a very particular expression of Mahayana Buddhism. I still attend my local temple during big ceremonies or festivals, and have taken refuge under a Vietnamese master. As an adult, I came to have gripes with how many Vietnamese people treated Mahayana Buddhism as ""our"" cultural property, looking down on other schools, etc. But I thought it was weird that despite laying claim to being Mahayanists, a lot of people didn't take the idea of original enlightenment or Buddha nature very seriously. Popular cultural beliefs include thinking only monks can become enlightened, or that there was something fundamentally special about Siddhartha Gautama that caused him to be enlightened. Exacerbating this was also the popular tendency to put Confucian ideals above Buddhist principles. Naturally, this pushed me to seek to learn and practice Buddhadharma elsewhere. I already had an interest in dharani, mantras, etc. I thought maybe it was time to branch out to esoteric Buddhism, and learn more about its promises of lightning-fast enlightenment and deep experiential insights.

With the pandemic happening, and there being an enthusiasm for making events accessible to people who could not leave their homes, I was able to do a good amount of ""window shopping"" when it came to teachers of Vajrayana. Of course one major teacher I would land on, as numerous people have, would be Garchen Rinpoche. I attended a lot of empowerments, and according to his students this gives you ""authorisation"" to do the sadhanas associated with them. But I was left with more questions than answers about how to actually practice, visualising correctly, etc. etc. Questions I wouldn't be able to just ask straightforwardly and get an answer. I found I wasn't happy with calling someone my teacher, but not having an actual student-teacher relationship with them. I felt just as lost as I was before I even found out about Vajrayana.

A friend with a mutual interest in Vajrayana introduced me to a group called Tantric Sorcerous Underground. I will admit, I immediately had reservations regarding the name. I was really worried about all sorts of implications the name would have. But then I also thought, would people not consider people in the old days being able to summon rain, cure epidemics, end civil wars, ""sorcerers""? I set aside my immediate concerns and gave joining TSU a chance.

My request to join was granted, and I spent a good amount of time asking very inane and beginner-level questions. This wasn't really to test the waters or anything, by this point I was still very ignorant and just had a lot of questions, and assumptions. Lama Federico and Lama Sherab would both be very responsive and answer my questions very thoroughly. After taking time to see how they treated newcomers I decided it would be a good time to take my first empowerment with them.

It was a completely different experience from a Dharma Center empowerment event. At no point did I ever feel lost during it, we were guided step by step and at the end of it I was equally as shocked that we would be going through the sadhana together, and received explicit instructions over how to actually do the practice. To top it off, any further practice questions would be personally answered by the Lamas. This remains generally the norm for how teachings are done in this group, sometimes a senior student is also able to help field questions and they try to answer as specifically as they can. I also came to find their exegesis on sutra and tantra texts to be highly informative and helpful, and it led me to develop trust that these two people have a genuinely good understanding of Buddhism.

Now, more than two years later, besides adjustments to how courses are structured and levels of student experience are organised, not much about my experience with TSU | TRC and its Lamas have changed very much.

Despite provocative vocabulary, and unique revealed teachings from LF and LS, we don't actually all get together to do drugs and have kinky sex parties and what have you. Sorry if you came to this thinking a victim of a crazed sex cult has finally come forward, but it is just another Vajrayana Buddhist group. They offer plenty of more traditional sadhanas and termas if the former things just aren't your cup of tea.

Whatever your disagreements with how this group presents itself, the people within do care very much about preserving traditional Buddhist teachings, and are just trying to offer them to more people in an attention-grabbing and fun way.

To those of you who *wish* for TSU to be a sex cult, and then are waiting for someone to get hurt from it so you can be proven right, I would sincerely ask you to reevaluate your motivations for calling yourself a Buddhist. That just does not seem right to me.

"Unless you have received confirmation from a qualified master, you are not enlightened.","This is something that I've encountered often enough to warrant a post.

Individuals who claim that they have been enlightened, because they experience something that was unfathomable and undeniable and other-worldly... this is simply wrong thinking; nothing more than pride, ego, and imagination. It is only when one has been verified by a qualified teacher, of a respectable lineage, with roots in correct teachings of the Buddha, can one even begin to consider the possibility of their own enlightenment.

The lineage of the masters is something that is real and true; a gift from the Buddha himself. Traced back directly to the Buddha. It is the acknowledgement of the enlightenment of the student by the master. Not just a age-old tradition, but it too is an essential for curbing wrong thinking on the Path.

So many people these days read books like the Power of Now, Autobiography of a Yogi, Sri Ramana Maharshi, and other new-age fairy tales that speak flippantly on the nature of reality, despite being impossible to describe. Unfortunately, upon reading these boorish works, what comes about is not the discovery of enlightenment in the individuals, but rather the awakening of deep dark and defilements posing as enlightenment.

The practices of morality, constraint, and discipline are not merely traditional, feel-good practices; the relinquishment of unwholesome thoughts and habits and the embracing of wholesome thoughts and habits is in order to reduce the power that the defilements have over us, as a prerequisite to insight. Without cleansed virtue, one instead risks the corruption of whatever insight they gain. As my abbot once said, ""Even Mara had a great awakening.""

For those who take these shortcuts, either through books or drugs; what they risk finding is not true enlightenment, but a wolf in sheep's clothing. Those defilements, strong and courageous due to our untamed minds, will have no qualms appearing and parading around as God, when we look. What else can we do but happily submit to His every whim and command. He walks and talks just like the books said, and after our desperate search, we couldn't be more happy to find It. Without hesitation, we integrate It into our own mystique: ""I am enlightened!"" we proudly claim as we proceed to walk through life causing havoc and distress for everyone, in the same of our Lord, the True Self, the Present Moment, and other witless monikers that we proscribe. We unabashedly seek to dominate the lives of others: to control their actions, their deeds, for their own good, of course. We are the only source of Truth, after all, and anything done by anyone else that is disagreeable to our wishes is probably Evil.

What is there to be done to protect us from this terrible travesty?

This is where the lineage of the masters comes in. There's no need for us to make guess work, ""Am I enlightened? Am I not enlightened?"" for we have the lineage of the Buddha. When one has certain experiences in meditation, rather than jumping to any conclusions, we seek out the advice of a qualified master, the one who holds genuine lineage. We should not feel fear of disappointment, but gratitude for being steered in the right direction. Then, when awakening does happen, one can feel confident and secure that, not only has one achieved the Path, but one has the Buddha's guarantee that one has practiced rightly.

Thus, for those who only believe they are enlightened, you are not. Find and serve a qualified master, and when the time is right, ask them for verification of your meditative experiences.

Ultimately, whether you are awakened or not, it matters little; even after awakening, the path doesn't change in the slightest. Just keep on practicing the ending of defilements and the perfection of the paramitas. Nothing but awakening can happen if one follows this practice diligently.",Buddhism,1613948827.0,t3_lp94cf,0.57,9
I dropped a tab of LSD...just want to share my experience,"After a slight buzz that carried through the first 45 minutes I was giddy and excited to explore the college campus and found my way over to watching the sun set on the slope with my friend. Looking up at the clouds I was throw into a visual spectacle of fractal patterns and increased appreciation for color. It was after the first two hours that I started my journey that gave me a little taste of what enlightenment is.

I remembered. I remembered what I truly am and I remembered that I chose to forget what I was by incarnating as the person I am now. I remembered that I am everything; there is nothing else!  Wherever I looked someone into their eyes I realized I was looking at myself in another incarnation and that I was being observed by my other incarnations. I remembered that the dog wagging it's tail so happily was also me, and that the ground I was walking on was also me. 

Everything was me and I've known it my entire existence, I've just forgot it while incarnated in this life.

Why I hesitate and say this was only a taste of what Enlightenment truly is is because I was scared almost the whole time. I was scared that since I'm everything I'm alone. I began to ask ""what is the meaning of this,"" from the perspective of I am everything. ""Where did I come from"" I am God. I am relieved momentarily that I remember. But then I immediately regret remembering. It's too much, but I didn't want to go back and forget again. 

I was thinking ""I will not forget after this trip is done"" but as I slowly sobered the real me had a trick around every corner to make me forget. The anxiety that I create for myself pulled me back into the normal world smoothly and deceptively covered my quasi-enlightenment experience.  Now, after writing this, I realize that to obtain enlightenment, I'm going to have to see through the suffering I cause for myself. I'm going to have to stop making up problems for myself and start meditating through the ones I believe I currently have. Very strange. Very, very strange.

Hot Buddhist Sex,"I think a lot of people think Buddhism teaches that sex is bad. I once heard someone recently call it ""sinful."" That feels very Catholic to me. I think shame about your body or sexual energies is not a goal of Buddhist practice - quite the opposite.

I think that this is driven a lot by the Theravada/ Pali canon teachings, because they are oriented around instructions for celibate monastics. eat once a day, no sex, can't touch money, can't consume entertainment, can't interact between the sexes, must beg for food, can't own possessions.

These are exactly the correct instructions for renunciate celibate monastic ascetics. If laypeople tried to live this way generally it will just be a cause of stress because it is impossible.

Truth be told this is a limitation of Theravada. You can read the suttas and feel that one must become a monk to achieve anything at all.

 ""This is where lay practitioners encounter a limitation to practices oriented around celibate monasticism, and may benefit from tools for traditions that are are more oriented towards lay practice."" 99% of Theravada is the monastic vehicle and so there may be a limit to the content about sexual health. 

For laypeople it is okay to have sex. Buddhists don't need to feel that it is a moral crime or something they have to destroy.

Generally the way people relate to sex seems crazy to me. For example the idea that it is dirty or filthy or naughty or raunchy or... it's always viewed as like a force of corruption.

I think that this is because of the presence of other afflictive emotions. Greed, anger, jealousy, etc. Desire plus compassion is the heavenly realms - desire plus anger and jealousy is the demon realms.

What about desire free from anger, jealousy, or greed? In theravada they teach that you have to cut the chain of the 12 links at craving. At one meaning this can be taken to mean desire for sex - at a more refined meaning it is any subject-object differentiation. Ultimately, sexual energies are an aspect of the manifestation of the perfect display of wisdom of the Buddha bodies, not something that we are meant to cut out like a tumor.

Sexual energy resides in your mindbody. There's one aspect of it that is a physical energy, and one aspect that is a sort of mental energetic pattern. There are also subtle energies throughout the channels of your body, like capillaries in your veins.

Generally, if we hold our body or our mind in a way that's twisted up and tense, it will cause blockages. Like if you sit funny your leg falls asleep - your psychosexual energetic system can get blockages in it that cause you to feel afflicted in all kinds of ways.

A lot of people come onto here asking about if it's safe to masturbate or if that violates the five precepts. Anything a person does can be done in a healthy or an unhealthy way. One basically has to look at their own mental state. To what extent are you driven by compulsion?

There are some men who masturbate so frequently and with such aggressiveness that they actually removed the sensitivity in their penises. To speak nothing of the psychological effects of porn addiction.

This is kind of a disrespect of the body's own energetic system. Sexual energy is kind of like a precious life energy. It comes with youth and health, there is a limited amount of it.

And it does have a role to play in the body. In Traditional Tibetan medicine doctors would consider how many times it is safe to ejaculate without losing too much vital energy, based on various factors such as time of year and weather/ etc. In the winter they would cum less because you rejenerate your vital energies more slowly in the cold, and more slowly again without proper nutrition or calories.

So, masturbating 25 times a day is often not the answer, and driving yourself insane by holding your cum for years and years while you try not to kill yourself is not the answer either.

Questions like ""is masturbation bad"" are I tink the shadow of religious systems that are basically systems of power. the ten commandments for instance well-establish property and ownership - including rape and slavery. Health is not usually not the concern in religion - power is.

Buddhism isn't about power. Buddhism is about health. Our conditioning wants us to ask ""What do I have to do so the king doesn't flog me."" Ever since the neolithic revolution we have lived as slaves to kings of every sort, some named this some named that.

I say fuck the king. Go live wild. Follow the rules of nature like mankind is supposed to.

What question shall man ask  in the rules of nature?

He can ask if it is healthy. If it is in balance with the environment around it. Is it safe, does it have its needs met. What are its needs?

The logic of nature is very straightforward and simple, so much so that people  can't figure it out. This is true of health generally. A lot of people eat themselves to death, or chug two liters of coca cola per day and feed it to their babies. It is evidently easy to forget what is natural for a human body.

I think that when it comes to sex, we ultimately have to ask two questions: am I healthy? and, are they healthy?

I think that we need to give up on the idea that we can take pleasure in something that harm's someone else's well being. If we have such a tendency, we should resolve to abandon it. There are sexual complexes where people get aroused by the thought of hurting or killing people. it's a case to be made for free access to mental health care - if someone is jerking off to the thought of killing and eating you, you will want him to have a mental health professional to talk to.

I think though, we need to give up that we can drive pleasure not only big cases but even small harms, even the smallest ones. I don't mean pain play, like someone asking you to slap their booty. If someone wants you to slap their ass you can do it, I don't care.

I mean \*causing harm\*. Degrading their health and well being. Even if it seems like they consent to it, getting pleasure out of sexual activity that degrades another person's well-being is \*always\* going to end in an unsatisfying way.

The real joy of sexual contact is in the affection. This is a person that's chosen to express themselves to you in a deeply intimate way. We try to treat with sensitivity and care their well being. When two people genuinely care for each other's well being, the energy of mutual emotional supportiveness is very freeing. It can feel like freedom for the heart.

Ultimately, engaging in sexual contact with people who indifferent (or hostile) to your well being causes injury in the mindbody. Like burning the tip of your fingers again and again. I think we have to basically realise its not worth it.

This is why people drink alcohol in order to ""get dirty"" and ""get down."" You know what else you drink alcohol for? Before you're going to have a leg amputated when you don't have any anasthesia.

If sex for you is like cutting your leg off, then, perhaps it's worth asking - are you healthy? Is he/ she  healthy?

There's all kinds of paths to improving our health but the point is that people accept this as normal. They accept that that's just how life is as a human - sex is so painful and ailenating that we need to insert anasthesia before we can do it.

Desire can be beautiful when it is kept safe by sincere compassion.

You are not a monk,"Please do not take Buddhism to the extreme where you start to imitate monks while being a lay-person. I've experienced it myself and I see a lot of people doing that as well. The Lord Buddha had explicit teachings for lay-people and they can all be found in Pali Canon scriptures. Please, do not try to radically change your life because you feel so motivated to become a better practitioner. Focus on gradual training instead of trying to achieve everything within a week or a month. I personally hear from a few teachers telling lay people to meditate 4-5 hours a day, stop having relationships and become vegetarians. But for many of us it is pretty much impossible, especially living in this modern world. Also be very careful when doing a meditation practice or going on a retreat. There are monasteries that allow people without any training to stay for a month or more than that and this can be very dangerous for lay people if they don't have any prior meditation experience. Also do not change your diet drastically. If you stop eating meat immediately or eat only once a day, your body might get sick very fast. Even if you break precepts do not take to the extreme and don't be too harsh on your self. Buddhist practice is a gradual training that requires years and years of discipline and reflection. Take everything easily and the results will come!",Buddhism,1633948339.0,t3_q5szbv,0.52,2
How can Non-veg eaters. call themselves Buddhist?,"Even the most contemporary interpretation of Buddhism involves Non-killing as a precept.

Why Suffering?,"These are the Four Noble Truths.

The First Noble Truth is All Life is suffering.
The Second Noble Truth is suffering is caused by desire.
The Third Noble Truth is that there can be an end to suffering.
The Fourth Noble Truth is that the end to suffering is in following the Eightfold Path. The Eightfold Path is: Right understanding, Right thought, Right speech, Right conduct, Right vocation, Right mental attitude, Right mindfulness and Right concentration.

I try not to do this on this sub, because there is a general attitude here that Buddhism is like a survival guide. You have a problem, you turn your page 4 and read the solution. Only even turning to page 4 is too much for you. You want a hip and wise teacher who will give you the answer. It happens daily here. I often disagree with the answer, but I always disagree with the method. Buddhism isn't so you can read, or write an article called: The Top Ten Ways To Break Up With Your Boyfriend and Still Be a Good Person.The purpose is not for you to find splinters of meaning to hang your hate on, so you can talk about how much you don't like that guy, and still feel like a good person. That's not Buddhism. Normally, I don't say anything because I don't want to argue, and that's all that's going to happen because you're on your own path. You are a light unto yourselves, and that's as it should be. The more lost you are along the way, the stronger you will be when and if you finally reach your destination. 

I decided to write this because there is a strong need here for the basics. You all know Suttras and debate sanskrit terms, and are very smart knowledgeable Buddhists, but it seems like the basics of Buddhism are lacking.

Today, I'm writing about the First Noble Truth. The First Noble Truth is All Life is Suffering. There have been some posts and comments that people aren't liking the term Suffering and prefer another. Basically, you don't like The First Noble Truth at all and would prefer it say something else. You aren't the only one. You won't have a hard time finding articles by pundants of Buddhism, or even popular teachers who feel the same way. And at one time I was confused by this. I never had a problem with The First Noble Truth but I noticed that other people did. At the time I felt that these people knew a lot more about Buddhism than me, so was I missing something?

I read the objections and they basically go like this: I don't like the word suffering, because that means that life sucks, and my life doesn't sucks. I'm having a great time. I'm a Boss of Buddhism and almost completely enlightened. Life only sucks if you suck at Buddhism, if you have desire, if you're doing it wrong. My life isn't like that. My life may be a little stressful, but I'm a Boss at Buddhism, nothing sucks.

I also try not to do this because I personally don't like to read long posts on Reddit, so I try not to make long posts, but this is going to be long. I think that Buddhist teachings were originally translated by some pretty smart responsible persons: maybe a Monk or a Nun. I think someone gave a little thought to what they were doing, and I think they chose the word Suffering for specific reasons.

There are two reasons I think the word Suffering was chosen. The first is the actual scripture. Like the Bible there are several books which refer to The Four Noble Truths, but this is usually how it goes:

These are The Four Noble Truths. The first Noble Truth is suffering. Birth is suffering: decay is suffering: illness is suffering and death is suffering. The presence of objects we hate is suffering: separation from objects we love is suffering: not obtaining what we desire is suffering. In short, every form of attachment is suffering.

That is how it is written in most of the texts I've studied. Now if you replace suffering with the word stress, or unsatisfactory in that paragraph it seems to understate the issue. I'm sure you'll want to debate this, but this is how I've learned it. That text comes from a book called Mahavagga. It Say's 1:6, 19-22.

So, the other reason is the life of the Buddha, which is a very important Buddhist story. 

The Buddha was born the son of a King, and at his birth it was foretold that he would either be a great ruler or a great teacher, and his father was warned that if his son knew the reality of decay and death he would become a teacher. So the King tried to shield his son from the world, so that he would never learn of these things. But the Buddha, who's name was SiddhƒÅrtha, was a very head strong and curious man and decided to sneak out of the palace in disguise to see the world, and this is how he encountered the Four Signs.

The first sign was an old man. Siddhartha had never seen an old person before, and he asked his servant about it. His servant told him that old age happens to everyone. Another night he encountered a man who was sick with a disease that made his mouth foam and his eyes red. Siddhartha asked his servant about this and was told about illness, and that this usually happens to everyone. The third sign was a funeral procession. The dead person was carried on a litter at the front of the procession. Siddhartha was told about death, and that it happened to everyone. The fourth sign was when SiddhƒÅrtha saw a Monk. He was told that monks seek the truth, and that is what he decided to do. SiddhƒÅrtha wanted to find a solution to all these newly discovered problems: suffering.

This is not about stress. This is not simply unsatisfactory. This is not: I hate my job, I don't have a nice car, my friends are all jerks. This is not about that imperfect person you look down your nose at who is sad, or angry or worried. This is about Suffering. Sure, you can add all those things to it, looking down your nose at someone is suffering too. So is shallow fake pity, and angry arrogant judgement. All life is suffering.

When you look at The Four Noble Truths this way it changes everything. The Second Noble Truth is about the cause of suffering. Suffering is caused by desire. You desire a new car and you can't afford it. Yes, that's stressful. OK that might even be unsatisfactory. But this is about suffering, your desire for life, health, comfort. All life is suffering. Suffering is caused by desire. This is Buddhism.",Buddhism,1472553311.0,t3_50agiw,0.47,0

PSA: You Are Not The Authority On Buddhism,"Buddhism is a practice which is thousands of years old, spans continents, and encompasses at least a dozen major sects.  It is also a practice which teaches that it's truths cannot be accurately expressed in words, and encourages practitioners to take personal responsibility for their understanding of it's concepts.  As such, it is inappropriate to simply tell others that they are incorrect when they express a thought about Buddhism that you don't recognize as true -- *especially* if you are doing so simply because you've read things which appear to contradict it.  It is more approriate to ask questions or throw your own perceptions into the conversation.  Do not simply say ""You're wrong,"" explain why you feel that way at the very least.  It is also inappropriate to downvote comments simply becauae you disagree with them -- the downvote button is for low-effort or inappropriate comments, not comments which you don't agree with.  For a community of mindful individuals, this is the most obnoxious subreddit I belong to.  I shouldn't have to worry about being insulted and talked down to regularly in a Buddhist community like this.

"Buddhists in sciences, do you think that what the Buddha saw was just Fourier transform?","So I observe that all problems in life seem to be unable to find the balance point between two opposite things, and the pendulum is commonly used as an illustration to this. But if it makes a suitable analogy, why don't we find out which physical property that make it a suitable analogy? 

[Long story shorted](https://osf.io/m3x2q/?file=5b03270ba556d00011088b6b), I think that what the Buddha saw was just Fourier transform, because: 

* The koans advocate you to remove your conceptualization to see the thing that even the teachers cannot tell you. So is the faded trajectory of a pendulum between its two clear extremes.
* Samsara is periodic, so is oscillators.
* Meaningful quotes or jokes always have a logical contradiction, that are so true and so absurd at the same time. 
* The mind is regarded as a sensor like the eyes or the ears, which do Fourier transform all days.
* The physical phenomenon that are considered to align with Buddhism perspective - the uncertainty principle - is actually a consequence of Fourier transform, not quantum mechanics.

Why do monks hide?,"I am getting more and more into meditation and my mind is getting undoubtably clearer but something still concerns me. Why are the most enlightened monks and other followers of buddhism, who preach of their compassion and wisdom, not going out and changing the world for the better? In my current state of increased calm and clarity, it seems clear to me that the most compassionate thing one can do is take aggressive action and make the world a better place but when I look for role models, people who have used their increased wisdom as a tool to compete against evil, I see very few. I see most monks and others like them seem to predominantly remove themselves from society, and even worse, take charity from others.

"There's no such thing as ""Asian"" Buddhism","When Buddhism first came to the west academics who studied it classified Buddhism as ""western"" v ""Asian"" Buddhists.

Academic studies emphasised Asian Buddhists as doing it by tradition/family obligation and Western Buddhists as ""true believers"" who literally believed everything they heard and who made tremendous personal sacrifices to study it. This was when the western world was much richer than the East.

Since the 1960s this model is now very out of date as many of the Asian countries are some of the richest places on earth - see Japan; HK; Taiwan; South Korea; Singapore and the like.

Many formerly third world countries now have a second world standard of living - average salaries in Thailand are now close to USD1k per month. 

Most of the ""Asian"" Buddhist tropes are out of date and seem to apply to rice farmers in South East Asia rather than to Japanese Google employees or investment bankers in Taiwan.

""Asian"" tropes seem to never apply to middle class to upper class workers in Japan; HK or Singapore. Ie people who speak multiple languages; post on Reddit and who have multiple properties in different countries in some cases.

It's more accurate to say ""x"" v ""why"" when speaking of the types of Buddhist practice.

This is particularly the case when many ""western"" Buddhists have Asian roots as second or third generation immigrants or reconnected with Buddhism from temples in western nations such as New York/Sydney etc.

The gap between a banker who is white who is Buddhist and a tech developer from Singapore who is also Buddhist is pretty modest versus the understanding and life experience of someone from Laos/Cambodia or Bhutan who is less economically well off.

If someone wants to learn about Buddhism they should be exposed to as many different schools of thought as possible to find one that ""fits"" them.

I've used this expression myself; but it's incorrect.

I think some of it might be related to idpol and the desire to create binary ""x"" v ""y"" categories - ironically an American thing that's tend to essentialise people into easily understood ""categories"".

A lot of the stuff I see described as ""white"" Buddhism applies to how Buddhism is practiced in Japan for example in Zen.

Asian Buddhists can learn a lot from how European descendants practice Buddhism and Asians can teach Europeans much too. It's a two-way process of ""learning"" between fellow students not one group ""teaching"" another.",Buddhism,1615652358.0,t3_m49hio,0.52,1

Why doesn't Mahayana Buddhism allow holy war?,"Hi

> ""Killing to save lives"" is, uniquely amongst Buddhist schools considered justified by certain Mahayana scriptures such as the Upaya-kaushalya Sutra where, in a past life, Shakyamuni Buddha kills a robber intent on mass murder on a ship (with the intent both of saving the lives of the passengers and saving the robber from bad karma).

This[ Wikipedia article](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Buddhism_and_violence) talks about a sutra where the Buddha kills a criminal to reduce the suffering and death of living beings. This sounds like utilitarian logic. If we reason like this, why doesn't the Mahayana allow defensive holy war to defend Buddhism when its lands are attacked? The justification could be that defending the dharma saves many living beings in the future.

(My personal opinion is that we shouldn't kill anyone, even at the cost of our own lives. But I'd like the Mahayana's opinion on my question).

Most people's understanding of Anatta is completely wrong,"Downvote me, I don't care because I speak the truth

The Buddha never espoused the view that self does not exist. In fact, he explicitly refuted it in MN 2 and many other places in no uncertain terms.

The goal of Buddhism in large part has to do with removing the process of identification, of ""I making"" and saying ""I don't exist"" does the exact, though well-intentioned, opposite.

You see, there are three types of craving, all of which must be eliminated completely in order to attain enlightenment: craving for sensuality, craving for existence, and cravinhg for non-existence. How these cravings manifest themselves is via the process of identification. When we say ""Self doesn't exist"", what we are really saying is ""I am identifying with non-existence"". Hence you haven't a clue what you're talking about when discussing Anatta or Sunnata for that matter.

Further, saying ""I don't exist"" is an abject expression of Nihilism, which everyone here should know by  now is not at all what the Buddha taught.

Dharma and Sex,"&#x200B;

I have been toying in my head for a long time with the idea of making a post about sex and dharma.

It is a bit challenging to do, for one, people have really strong emotions about sexuality which can relate to their fears, their sense of identity, their orientation in the world... their sense of cleanliness and purity or dirtiness and defilement. Many of us carry trauma of sexual abuse in our bodies or other traumas and we have an  aversion to sexuality and the body caused by the pain of this trauma.

If one is to talk about sex and the Dharma I think it should be really pithy and compassionate to be worth saying.

How to do that? Where to start?

Among Buddhists, I think that it is possible to find a strong fixation to sexuality. A sort of puritanism. I think that this is not  common to Buddhism - one can easily find this across religions.

I think that a cultural orientation around celibate monastic lineages can have the effect of encouraging this. People think real Buddhism means being a celibate monk. This idea - of Buddhism being a monk's robes - is a mental fixation.

I think there's this image of, buddhism is a robed guy who has a long list of things he's not allowed to do, and if he does anything, bam, he's fucked. If he follows the rules forever eventually he's enlightened, but mainly, it's about wearing robes and not being allowed to do stuff. You're not allowed to have sex.

This is relevant in the Savakha Sangha, yes, and in some monastic lineages. And they have their reasons for it. But the kind of implicit religious belief that, this is what everyone's supposed to do, and if they're not , it's shameful, creates a lot of... well, shame.

Conservative culture reinforces it a lot, and, behind that, can hide all kinds of bodily kilesas and shame and ego clinging hiding in the body and in one's way of relating to the world.

The Ajahn Mun lineage are my heroes, But there's no lay version of this in thai culture. You can't really divorce Ajahn Mun from ""celibacy."" That's full on part of the package when you talk about the savakha or theravada monastics. So the best you can hope to be in that system is - wishing you were the monastic. You can never really do it. Maybe emulate a little bit for a short while then you run back to samsara. This is a barrier to your potential as a layperson to practice in the style of the monks. The life style is just so different, you really cannot emulate it. You're not doing dhutangas. People like to talk about that sutta of the buddha telling the guy that he would rather stick his dick in a snake than a woman like it shows how evil sex is. But this is parcel of a practice involving dhutangas. That's the context of this teaching. If you're a lay person with a familly you're not practicing the dhutangas and the patimokkha. You're just not, it's not going to happen. Not unless you ordain.

This is one cultural advantage that Himalayana Buddhists have. There are lay equivalents. I can cite an example. Dr. Nida is a lineage master of Tibetan Buddhism but - he is also, just a guy. He's got a wife and kids, and his kids sometimes run in the background when he gives teachings. He's also a traditional medicine doctor. Drukmo Gyal, his disciple, is an amazing woman who is a shining holy beacon of Dharma.

For me as an attempted practitioner of Vajrayana - it is as clear as day that these are realised bodhisattvas. To me it is obvious that Drukmo Gyal is Arya Tara. Can't you tell? She is not hiding it at all. I don't care that he's not practicing the dhutangas and the pattimokha. He's got a different tradition he's practicing and this one is just as legit and wayyyyyy easier to do than fucking with the tigers.

The practices of these lineages of people like Drukmo Gyal and Dr. Nida are not oriented around celibate monks who are practicing the Dhutangas like Ajahn Mun. There are other ways to do dharma than to live in a cave and do the dhutangas.

As for me I tried to live in a cave. I have fucking had it with samsara. I am so sick of this shit, let's do it, get me out of here. Beam me up. I wanted to ordain. Under Ajahn Martin, who was a disciple of Ajahn Maha Boowa. Bring on the fucking tigers lets do it. I almost did it. But I couldn't leave my wife.  I didn't want to. I love her. But I thought that celibate monastic is the \*only\* dharma then. And I thought I had to give it up. So i turned away and tearfully returned to my life in the world as a .... non celibate lay householder... and I bent over for Mara. This is it - I can't get out. But I couldn't leave her. She is my other half. Our fate is together. i can see that clearly.

And then the tears dried and I discovered - there is another way. There is a lay dharma. Even if my heart is still in the cave staring down the tiger, I can be, outwardly, in a household.

The Ajahn Mun lineage meditates on bodiily death to completely uproot their sexual desire. You can meditate on pictures of mangled corpses to uproot your sexuality.  Read Arahattamagga Arahataphalla.

You can do it  that way. This is real theravada. How can I do it? How can I fuck my darling wife while meditating on her yoni rotting rotting and decaying? It doesn't vibe. Something about this did not seem harmonious.

You don't have to do it that way. If you really, really believe - that celibacy and destroying all sexual desire - is the only way - then you would have to commit to it. I believed it, and so, I committed to it. If you say you believe it but don't commit to it then you're just trash talking. Put your money where your mouth is and do it. I did it -  I was trying to some how at the same time make love to my wife and meditate asubha.

But I realised quick - this is just not the right way for me to practice the dharma in my circumstances. Same as when I tried to eat in monastery rules while at home. Not eating after 12 just caused so much stomach pain and i'd have to eat to the point of extreme bloating to eat enough in one meal. It just wasn't giving any benefits. Now I just eat in a way that feels natural.

IT's the same with sex. You don't have to intentionally uproot your sexuality. Or try to destroy it or crush it, or think of it as some kind of sin. Some inherent evil. The chains of desire chaining you horribly to samsara if you give in to them.

That shit is Mara. To view our bodily energies this way is Mara. Our own minds are not separate from the minds of the buddhas. How, then, can we perceive our minds, our bodies, as corrupt and impure? What kind of refuge do you have in the three jewels that you view the Buddha's body like that?

You can do it the Ajahn Maha Boowa way and do corpse meditation, but if yo'ure going to do it, commit to it. If you're still a householder - then accept being a householder. Don't be a householder who strains out of the wish he was a celibate monk instead. It's just not healthy, and it's not effective dharma practice. It's okay. Just let yourself be who you are. Love you wrife, or, whomever. Squeeze her tits (if she likes it.) Do the whole thing. It's okay, it's not sin. What do the kids say these days? Back that ass up? Twerk it? All of them, why not.

There is nothing dirty about sexuality or sexual desire. There's nothing wrong about it or bad about it. Bodily shame is mara. I think that this often a revolutionary and inflammatory thing to say around Buddhists but that's why I think it needs to be said. Because it is true.

Generally, shame and bodily shame, trauma, and repression are endemic to the world of this age. This world is full of darkness. It is unfortunate. Many religious traditions are tainted by corruption or sexual abuse. People are so used to hearing sex with ""abuse"" that they can think that all sex is abuse.

Sex is also healing, it is also divine. There is a way of relating to our bodily energies in a compassionate way. Viewing them as inherently corrupting or evil is not compassionate. IT is cruel. It is like taking knives and stabbing them into the energetic space of our subtle psyche. Shame is a mental violence. It is wrong view.

Sex is also magically powerful. IT is not by accidente that it is only sexual energies which may manifest birth into the world. In their pure form, the sexual essences of both men and women are the sun and moon of Buddha nature.

Among lay practitioners, I think, there is a conversation to be had, basically, about how much a man should cum. Ejaculation has an energetic effect on the body and this is related to spiritual practice. What is that effect? How much do you care about the effects of loss of essence? Alternatively, what about his partner's needs? A woman (or, whomever) will have her own sense of how much man milk she needs to feel healthy. How does this balance against his sense of his own supply? I'm not telling you how to answer it - I'm just saying, that's a conversation to have. Just like ""how much should I eat."" If you really believe in bodily shame you will be too afraid to ask, you think it's wrong.

It is never wrong to learn with your partner to share more intimate trust. As a compass points north, it is always right. If you really truly love your partner you may find that the door to divinity's bedroom has been unlocked. This is not samsaric activity - deep love is the real shit, it is no joke. love is spiritual power.

The intimacy involved in a relationship like this can be an avenue for healing traumas in the body. Sexuality when used skillfully can be a tool for healing traumas. Sasha Cobra says a lot about this.

If we can release shame, then, we can connect with the subtle energies in our body in a more full and harmonious way. Shamatha. In doing so we will can realise their true nature with greater clarity. Vipassana.

What is the essence of sexual energy in the body? In a man? In a woman? Does a woman lose a sexual her sexual essence when she orgasms? What is lost?

Okay, what if she doesn't. How much can she orgasm, before being energetically spent? Her ""upper limit?"" what's his?

It's different for men because male ejaculation exhausts an energy in the way that is not lost with female ejaculation. female essence is lost more from menstruation and, i think maybe, breastfeeding. Girls don't blow their load and that's sort of a magic power.

So if a man wants extra bliss than he can get from just spraying around as quick as he can, he has to learn \*some\* kind of discipline because he has to borrow her magic power - to orgasm without blowing her load. It has to be a team effort. If a man really wants to experience bliss - he cannot do it with selfish sex. His small deposit is a mere moon in comparison to the great sun of her female bliss. If he learns to work with her - she can take him to places of bliss he could never, ever go himself.

IS this so dirty? Why? If you are lay person, your partner is the very center of your life. Is it so wrong to learn to please each other?

If you talk to a lot of women privately, they might  quietly express their exasperation that some men don't have the ""discipline"" to hold it. This is a real issue for them. At some point, using someone else's body for release while refusing to give them release is predatory. At the same time, most people could learn and grow with some supportive communication. Sexual ethics are not separate from your dharma practice. They *are* your dharma practice.

A legalistic attitude can prevent us from engaging deeply with virtue. A person could say, ""I didn't engage in sexual misconduct because she didn't fit these criteria... 1) married to another... 2) living with her parents.... etc. but then still be cruel or selfish. It's possible to do this. Mistaking the ""precept"" for the virtue is like mistaking the moon for the finger pointing at the moon.

Engaging deeply with sexual ethics isn't about some list. It's about compassion. What change did you bring about in the world by sticking it in her (or, whomever?) How \*healed\* were they to share intimacy with you? How honest were you, how compassionate your intentions?

How compassionate were you to yourself? I have known women who engaged in sex acts with a lot of abusive guys because she wanted to punish herself. She knew it would hurt her. She felt she deserved it. She was full of shame, anger, and sadness. In some kind of way, she had compassion for others - but she did not have it for herself. That was the real issue of why this was unskillful sexual activity.  Not because cocks are evil and filthy and they polluted her vagina like nuclear waste in the river, but because, she didn't have compassion for herself and was hurting herself emotionally.

I think that, historically and culturally, harsh repressiveness of sexuality is a tool for oppressing women. There are a lot of religious conservative cultures, including buddhist ones, where all the women know they will be harshly punished for sexual sin (which, for a woman, can be almost anything) but everyone looks the other way as the men cheat on their wives with prostitutes or whomever they can. This kind of piousness is disingenuous. It is just a cover for abusiveness and oppressiveness.

Ethical sexuality grants - everyone, but, also - women the space to make their own sexual decisions.

It is a little bit similar to the issue of menstruation and access to feminine pads. It is shocking to learn about what women go through in some societies where they don't have access to feminine hygiene.

The cultural taboo is a vehicle for oppression.  Women's basic physical needs for survival are forbidden to be discussed. If women are not allowed to say ""menstruation"" or ""orgasm,"" one will not need to look far to see them being treated as cattle.

This is the rabbit hole of bodily-shame. Don't let it try to ride on the coattails of Dharma practice. It is not dharma. Sometimes in this world we are like the frog that has been slowly boiled. Standards have gotten so bad that we can't even tell anymore. We have always lived in a world where the divine feminine has been subjugated.

To view a woman's body as sinful is a breach of the fundamental refuge in the three jewels. To view the body as corrupt and defiled is to be caught by Mara.

If you believe in Buddha Nature then you have to find the Buddha Nature even in creampies.

"How do you reconcile some of the ""bullshit"" in buddhism with the fact that it was written by accomplished meditators?"," So I think most western practitioners kind of bracket out some aspects of buddhism. Maybe it's the siddhis that they will not believe or the 31 lokas with their devas and asuras, or the existence of past lives and the potential to remember them. All of these things are hard for the western mind to swallow. 

 In western buddhism this skepticism is handled by saying that one needn't believe any of these things to practice meditation. But is such a position tenable?

"We truly learn how to ""stand alone"" when we summon the courage to leave the SGI cult.org behind, and seek our own path to enlightenment.","We finally learn how to ""stand alone"" when we summon the courage to leave the SGcult behind. Disconnecting from the control-monster cult.org imparts a wonderful feeling of freedom and lightness that replaces the repression and delusions which we had formerly allowed to enslave our minds, spirits, and our precious humanity. 

Leaving the Sgcult is strikingly similar to breaking up with a psychopathic spouse. In both cases, one must summon great courage and overcome each and every fear that keeps one locked into a harmful and destructive relationship, while deluding oneself into believing there is no other choice that can be made to alleviate the pain and suffering that life may bring. Friends and family (or cult.org members), usually resort to ""blame the victim"" tactics rather than admit the ugly truth, thereby protecting the abusive oppressor and their ""good reputations"".  Even worse, we may self-delude into playing the victim role all by ourselves, and do all of the defending the abuser stuff ourselves as well.  But no matter if its a spouse or a cult.org, the problem remains the same - we have conceded control (submission) to some dominating figure or authority outside of being, thereby giving up the freedom to chose for ourselves.

Psychopaths, be they abusive spouses or religious organizations, are adept at hiding their evil control-obsessed nature, while simultaneously presenting a beautiful and perfect picture of themselves to the world. They fake-smile while driving their straws deep, hoping to suck their victim's energy dry without them even noticing the drain. If you do begin to notice something and make overt objections, or try to re-establish self-autonomy, they quickly reach into their bag of psychological tricks to help misdirect and use your own words and thoughts against you, keeping you off balance, enslaved, easily manipulated, and led to believe there is no other choice but the one being presented to you by your abuser/user.

Completely dominating members through ""guidance"" is an SGcult leadership power trip and cult control mechanism. The cult understands that by appointing ""leaders"" they gain a very powerful and useful tool of control over the members. Even the good people that know better than to get sucked in by the slick cult propaganda become easily coerced into cult.org obedience by their surprise induction into the leadership hierarchy. Little by little (or sometimes in great leaps) cult.org members surrender themselves to the will and authority of higher positioned leaders, until they have become an empty shell of themselves (to use their own terminology - manifesting the world of ""animalism""),

I do not speak rhetorically here - this is something I know about from three decades of cult.org experiences. When I was in college during the early seventies, I had so involved myself in being an SGI cult.org senior leader that I suffered a major identity crisis during my first attempts to reject control of my life by the SGcult leadership.  Eventually, I literally had to run away and go into hiding so they couldn't find me and brow beat me into returning to my senior leader position (as had happened during my previous attempts to get free of the cult.org).  HQ in LA actually harassed my parents by phone repeatedly in an attempt to gain information about my whereabouts. I felt that I had to move out of state to keep them off my trail, because I was so fearful that the SG cult would re-addict me to their brand of heroin.

The ex-members that have been brave enough to stand alone are the truly fortunate ones - we recognized the danger from the cult to ourselves and made our break(s). But most members are too bamboozled by cult propaganda to know what is happening to them - they get hooked for life, or even worse, for generations by the SGcult. Like an abused spouse, these subservient cult victims always manage to find any poor excuse for the bad behavior of their dominating, abusive oppressors (leaders).

Years later during the eighties, I was still yearning to practice with a group. During my second stint of practicing with the SGcult, I thought that I could safely cancel out the negative aspects of cult leadership by refusing to hold a leadership position of any sort. I jokingly called myself a ""positionless leader"". But it didn't pan out, as I eventually still had to deal with the ego and power trips of the leadership hierarchy. The local cult leadership would continuously redress (f**k with) my small group of unorthodox member/friend/converts (mostly over facial hair and using cannabis), while leaving me completely unscathed, as they had no control mechanism (leadership position) to bully me with. The local cult.org threatened to take away leadership positions from any youth division leader that did not comply with their rules, and it was a ploy that worked practically every time. People were forced into making lifestyle choices to conform (or were forced into lying about it) which ultimately benefited and pleased the leaders/org only. 

When I witnessed the hypocrisy and injustice being fostered by local senior leaders upon all the youth division members to concede to their unreasonable demands for conformity, I saw a repeat of what they had done to me in my youth. I stood alone and spoke out against it.  It was the right thing to do, and it was very self-empowering, and it instantly created much hatred and animosity toward me as I spoke out with the hard cold truth. But the senior leaders still couldn't DO anything to me, because I wasn't a leader (sheep/follower), and could not be threatened with the removal of some precious official position granted to me by the good graces of the cult.org. I ceased participating in cult.org activities and eventually, I departed from the SGcult for a second time, only this time I was angry, not scared.

Fast forward to 2003 - my third round of involvement and ultimately final departure from the SGcult. I had remarried and moved to Seattle, and had taught my new wife how to do gongyo (recitation of the sutra) with me.  She wanted the experience of practicing Buddhism with a group, so there I was yet again, back with the SGcult for the third time. Then, the straw that finally broke the camel's back occurred when the SGcult senior leadership in Seattle refused to speak out against the Iraq War, or even support any of the efforts of SG members that were boldly independent enough to be anti-war activists without the cult.org's blessings. 

Every feeble excuse made to support the Iraq War by the local SGcult leaders only served to drive home the hypocrisy of this so-called ""Buddhist"" organization (with it's untold BILLIONS in assets) that is in reality, pro-war (just the opposite of the Makiguchi/Toda propaganda fable). I finally had enough of the SGcult and it's hypocritical over-the-top Ikeda mentor-worship. Getting rich and powerful by exploiting the suffering of people isn't Buddhism. Where was the compassion? Where was the enlightenment? As usual, nowhere to found within a religious organization more akin to being a cult. Nothing but another absolutely disgusting display of arrogance and militarism was all that was apparent to me. The SGcult can talk the talk but not walk the walk, and then turn around and celebrate dear leader as being in the same league as Gandhi or King.  F**king hypocrites!  As I walked out the door of the Seattle ""culture"" center for the last time, I knew I would never return to the SGcult.org. Never!

Fast forward another ten years. I stumbled upon an amazing online discussion forum on cults. At last, after 40 years, I came became fully awakened to the true nature and scope of the SGcult world.  Perceiving the hidden realities and connecting all the dots about my former cult.org, and just as importantly, about my dysfunctional relationship with the cult, was such a fantastic revelation of truth and healing.  And I found many kindred spirits that shared my experiences and viewpoint.  For the first time in along while, I didn't have to stand alone, as I had discovered a support group that could relate to me and that I in turn could relate to. 

Over the years, doors opened in my mind and in my heart, and I continued to step through the portals until eventually, I became bathed in the bright light of spiritual freedom. Never before have I been so happy as I continue to proceed along my personal path to enlightenment, no longer encumbered by any cult.org detours or delusions.  

In the end, sooner or later, we inevitably must sometimes stand alone while continuing to seek our own ""way"", our very own path to Buddhahood.  And we must never seek this path outside of ourselves, just as the Buddha taught.  

I fervently pray that we shall all quickly attain the true way.  (Soku joju busshin)

"Buddha taught to light your own torch and not to follow anyone, why is everyone would be so dependent of texts and teachers?","If writing a textbook would help everyone, why didn't Buddha write one instead of going around and teaching people?

Buddha's teaching is very specific to the person being taught. Buddha's teaching is like medicines to specific illnesses. You can't just drink all the medications and expect to get well.

Texts can be so misleading due to translations. Words can have so many meanings. And even if they are correct, it can only be correct for a specific amount of time. That is why despite learning all the texts, nobody becomes Buddha or Arhants in the last 2000 years. Also, the Buddha and the Arahant never learn any texts or recite mantras. 

I am not saying to disregard the texts or teachings, I am saying if don't actually see the teachings in yourself, then those teachings are useless. 

Buddha also never gives finite answers on concepts of souls, rights and wrongs, etc. Do you know why?

Simply because these concepts are not true. The human mind tries to understand things by translating them into concepts, but these are not true nature of thing. Cause what is real is always changing, you can describe it now but the next second, what you just said is false. What was right could be wrong in the next minute. 

Buddha also never answers questions that come from logical/egoic minds. Do you know why?

Questions like where do fire, earth, water, wind come from? He never answers those types of questions because doesn't get you anywhere. 

The core of Budha teaching is not about how to attain Nirvana, or any blissful state, or end of rebirth. Why?

Because if you goals were to reach these things, you are still greedy. You still want something. The only thing Buddha taught was how to end suffering. So how is it not greedy, wanting to end suffering? Because to end suffering, you must be free from the ego self. The ego self will grab on to everything and identify with them, including Nirvana, and a blissful state. Wanting Nirvana and fearing of losing it is suffering. Wanting to end rebirth and not attaining it is suffering. Fearing of hell realm is suffering, and wanting to go good things to reincarnate in a higher realm is greedy.

The Buddha never teaches the hell realm is bad, and the heavenly realm is good. Without the hell realm, nobody will become Buddha.  In facts, people in the heavenly realm are more likely to reincarnate into the hell realm than humans. Buddha said that.

However, as the result of ""reaching"" stream entry, you will no longer reincarnate into hell realms. Cause by then, you are no longer egoic or self-central. You see what Nirvana is and what suffering is.

Three questions from a Christian.,"i‚Äôm a christian, but i‚Äôm curious in knowing other religions, i know that i can‚Äôt comprehend buddhism, and i as an un-enlightened person can‚Äôt comprehend the concept of enlightenment, so for me the concept of reaching Nirvana makes no sense. 
I have three questions:

1) if the Nirvana is the cessing of desire in a human being that doesn‚Äôt want anything more from this or any other life. But why would i want that? If i‚Äôm in an infinite cycle of death and rebirth, it will eventually end (human species will eventually end). So why would i want to stop this cycle? The only logical answer would be if All the existence was pain, and that‚Äôs possibly true, but life isn‚Äôt just about that, a parent could be in the worst period of his life but be happy watching the smile of his child, and a child dying of hunger could find rest in the arms of his mother, we humans are complex beings: we can concentrate on hope when the world around us is crumbling. Even during the WW1 people celebrated christmas all together, enemy with enemy, killer with killer. So how do you Buddhist answer the problem Of Good?

2)how can you be sure? If Buddhism is based on human reasonament maybe 99% of it‚Äôs teaching could be true, and i admire that, but it‚Äôs what we can‚Äôt know that Buddhism doesn‚Äôt know either: reincarnation, how can you be sure we reincarnate: if we don‚Äôt reincarnate being a buddhist can still make you find your true happiness but can you be sure it‚Äôs true happiness?

"I propose that abuse is a near inevitable consequence of dogmatism, regardless of what religion, and that secularism is the best solution to getting rid of it","First of all, I love Buddhism. I value Buddhist psychology, philosophy, practices, etc. very highly, and am glad that it's finally getting taken more seriously in the Western Academic world.   


BUT, if you A: pride something, someone, anything, as sacred, untouchable, unquestionable, unaccountable and B: consequently: prioritise/place it before ethics, logic, the pursuit of truth (what's good and what's true), etc. then, you create an environment where unethical action is near guaranteed to occur.   


Behaviour that in other situations you wouldn't tolerate for a second gets explained away, justified, ignored, allowed, because: ""the teachings/teachers are sacred and could not possibly be/do wrong."" And, concurrently, the teachers have free rein to do whatever they want/think, because everyone acts as if they're perfect/infallible/omniscient, etc. As with all things, there's an interdependent nature to all of this; followers/students are actually, unknowingly, fostering situations in which it's surprising there's not way more corruption than there is. It's like spoiling a child. If you never question someone and let them do whatever they want, whenever they want, surprise surprise, this may alter their personality in unpleasant ways.   


This is why I encourage secularism, not meaning to disregard any parts of Buddhism inherently (including the metaphysical/ontological/mystical aspects of it; as, to anyone well versed in the research, there's plenty of data that goes against materialism, etc.), but to prioritise ethics (re: the pursuit to figure out what's good and to do what's good to the best of your ability), and the pursuit of truth and logic (re: to drop practices/aspect of traditions that CAN BE and ARE either empirically \[e.g. with scientific data\] or analytically \[e.g. with logic/reason\] proven not to do what they say they do), before your tradition.   


Really, this, to me, self-evidently obvious logic is what I used to think the majority of Buddhists believed and acted in accordance with in the first place, and that it's even written into Buddhism not to do engage in dogmatism. Maybe this sub isn't a good representation of Buddhism as a whole, but the amount of people being pro-dogmatism here is astounding to me.   


‚ÄúNow, Kalamas, don‚Äôt go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture, by logical conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability, or by the thought, ‚ÄòThis contemplative is our teacher.‚Äô When you know for yourselves that, ‚ÄòThese qualities are skillful; these qualities are blameless; these qualities are praised by the wise; these qualities, when adopted & carried out, lead to welfare & to happiness‚Äô ‚Äî then you should enter & remain in them.‚Äù  


Anyone who is pro-dogmatism is generally revealed to be logically and morally inconsistent by The Golden Rule, as they wouldn't tolerate pro-dogmatism in any other domain but THEIR SACRED domain. E.g. if they found out that Catholic priests were abusing children, then they'd (hopefully) point out the problems with dogmatism causing this; but when it comes to their dogma, the same attitude isn't applied.   


I predict to get downvoted into oblivion here, because much to my surprise, Buddhists seem to be just as susceptible to dogmatism than any other religious followers, and ironically equally egoically/atta-ly sensitive to having it pointed out.

The other day I decided to ""friend""/follow his account.  I was kind of shocked to see him participating in /r/PublicFreakout and also making crass comments about homeless people.  It wasn't what I expected given his demeanor in the Buddhist subreddits.

The Buddha started as an extremist,"> He started out with the extreme of sensual indulgence. Then in order to get away from what he saw as the problem of sensual indulgence, he went totally into self torture. He was an extremist. If it wasn‚Äôt one extreme, it was going to be the other. **Thinking that deals in large abstractions tends to push us to extremism.** And the type of thinking that likes to deal in drama goes in the same way as well.
>
> So there‚Äôs an ordinariness to the practice that sometimes we resist. It‚Äôs like the poets and artists of the 19th century who despised the bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie were prudent and sensible, and the poets hated them. There was nothing dramatic in their lives. But living a dramatic life could be pretty miserable. **It may make for great art, but it‚Äôs a miserable life.** I read a novel one time in which a guy had been put in prison for murder. He was reading letters from his wife who was going through psychiatric counseling, in which her grief counselor had taught her to go step by step through the stages of her grief. And you could tell from tone of the narrative that the novelist despised grief counseling. It didn‚Äôt have the drama, didn‚Äôt have the excitement or grandeur of someone who gets excited enough to go out and kill somebody and then has to suffer the consequences.
>
> Again, that‚Äôs the kind of mindset that deals in extremes. Would you like to be somebody who is constantly going through one extreme or the other? Part of the mind enjoys it. It makes life more interesting. But it doesn‚Äôt really help in terms of finding a solid happiness. **There‚Äôs nothing dramatic about solid happiness.** There‚Äôs nothing dramatic about a sensible attitude that learns how to deal pragmatically with issues as they arise. That‚Äôs when you learn to get past the romanticism and the drama of the extremes. That‚Äôs when you really get on the path, and your practice really matures.

"Would it be okay to believe that Jesus performed miracles and maybe even rose from the dead, and still believe in Buddhism?","This is related to the question I asked yesterday https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/10510ez/according_to_the_pali_canon_the_buddha_had_all/ and the impression given by the answers that supernormal abilities are not super rare, so just because Jesus may have had supernormal abilities doesn't mean that Christianity is true and every other religion is false.

I have been interested in both Christianity and Buddhism for a few years now, and doctrinally they both cannot be true at the same time. So one way to reconcile the two would be to say that Christianity is correct about some things like the general existence of spiritual entities and that some people have possessed supernormal abilities, but wrong about others things, like the exclusivity of its doctrine and wrong about some other truth claims, possibly the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent creator God.

Is this a result of appreciating every moment because I find it a little off putting and worrying.

"""True Buddhists believe in rebirth"" - the corollary","The following points are true and not debated:

1. Secular Buddhism is not real Buddhism because it rejects core Buddhist doctrines such as literal rebirth and Kamma (over many lifetimes).
2. Can‚Äôt reach the traditional definition of Nibanna without these beliefs.

However it's still possible to make significant progress down the path towards Nibanna without believing in rebirth.

Imagine a person who follows the 5 precepts diligently, lives mindfully and always strives to cultivate skilful action.

He‚Äôs mostly happy and tries to uproot the poisons of greed, anger and delusion (excluding belief in rebirth).

He‚Äôs convinced of the Buddhist path (excluding belief in rebirth) and is well on the way. Nothing much can convince him away from his practices, he loves them and it's a part of who he is. He‚Äôs clearly committed and made significant progress down the Buddhist path.

My point is belief in rebirth is necessary to be a real Buddhist but it‚Äôs not necessary to have freedom from suffering (in this lifetime).

Live mindfully, don‚Äôt break the precepts, and strive to make progress. You will be fine.",Buddhism,1617776956.0,t3_mlvzm5,0.53,2
"What are your thoughts on psychedelics as a ""side dish"" to a meditation practice?","I've had a question I've wanted to ask for a long long while, but for some reason never did. I'm not sure if my question is related to Buddhism enough for this subreddit so if it doesn't fit here at all please let me know and I'll remove the post. 

Anyways, ill get right to it. I have some decent experience with psychedelics, between LSD and Psilocybin about 25-30 trips under my belt, with 6 sub breakthought DMT trips last summer (never could get myself to go over the edge, something holding me back, but I know I'll get there one day). However, this last january I started to do kriya & hatha yoga, very regularly. I'm up to about 3 hours of practice a day, and I'm seeing some of the thought trains, visual effects, feelings and emotions that came to me throught my trips are slowly entering into my everyday life (I guess just a result of increased perception?). At this point, I feel as thought I've taken a microdose as LSD, all the time, even thought I am completely sober, and I can only see this going upwards if I continue with the proper practice, lifestyle & such.

Thoughout all this progress, I've been interested to take a trip, but I wouldn't want to hinder the progress I've seen, but also, maybe the trip would be beneficial. I haven't tripped since last August. 

So my question is this: what do you think are the role of psychedelics on the ""spiritual path"" so to speak? Most ""spiritual"" role models (Dalai lama, sadhguru, osho, even Ram Dass) all speak against psychedelics in the serious spiritual path, and instead push for daily meditation and yoga practice. I think they may be a useful tool to ""declutter"" the brain a bit, but I'm not really sure. What is your opinion? Do any of you have experience with meditation and psychedelics?

Also one last thing, where do you think cannabis sits in all this? I used it in the past quite regularly, but ever since I've started my practices, it seems to just fog my mind, and hinder my meditations for the week or so after I use it.

Thanks for your time :)",Buddhism,1556101973.0,t3_bgsziw,0.55,3

"Teen trying to seek God , pls answer my question","I was an ardent believer of God I'm a Hindu I love this religion and is a beautiful religion for sure but I always had the problem with the concept of God .

At that moment it was around 11 o'clock at night yesterday I realised why isn't God helping these people the Hindu's answer it by saying it's your past life Karma but what I believe is that my soul is going to be burnt in the hell for the things I did why should my body the current body which is innocent should suffer the things which it did in passed life and not even remember . I realised this is the biggest cope. I don't think highly of the abrahmic religions. I do believe if God is there he can be found only in Hindusim.  but I now have doubt over the concept of God , whether he even exists or not . So I have some ques regarding God from budhists.

Why the Existence of Jainism is Pulling Me Back to a Secular Approach to Buddhism,"Starting out as an atheist, I have gotten into meditation more than a decade ago and, after experiencing the very real benefits of practice, over the years I have also grown to have a sincere reverence for the Buddha and the suttas (as well as Chan and Zen masters, but that's another story). It's clear that Buddhism holds many important truths about our lives, with the 3 marks of dukkha, anicca and anatta being the most important to me perhaps, as well as the beautiful and logical Noble Truths (at least the first 3).

The Buddha and his teachings are widely known today and there really is nothing quite like them - in most places. It stands as a unique monolith amongst world religions with it's standoffish (but true) view of the world (dukkha, anicca, anatta, sunyata) and framework of personal liberation. Buddhism's uniqueness holds true even among other ""dharmic"" religions of ancient India... or does it?

Enter Jainism. The truth is, Buddhism is not that different from Jainism as a _framework_, apart of course from the different philosophy and nuances. And here comes my detailed breakdown of the issues I face when I attempt to put absolute faith in Buddhism. None of these prove the religion untrue, but what they do prove is that it's far less unique than believed to be and in fact show it to be quite arbitrary and constructed. 

_Formulaic_ is the keyword here and while Jainism and Buddhism are obviously different, I'm hoping to build a quick picture of examples here that showcase this issue and ultimately point to probably neither of them being the absolute truth.

1. Karma

We all know that karma is not unique to Buddhism and exists in ""Hinduism"" (meaning vast and diverse religions of India) as well. Yep, Jainism has got it too. All three worldviews assign different attributes to it, but the main principle is generally the same. Reincarnation is also a concept in Jainism of course, although this is not surprising based on its cultural context.

2. Wandering Ascetic Origins

Both Buddhism and Jainism emerged from ascetic movements which well directly opposed to the established vedic religions of the time. In fact, they emerged around the same time too.

3. Enlightened Founder

Mahavira is to Jainism is what the Buddha is to Buddhism. Not only were they contemporaries but scholars hold that Mahavira was slightly earlier (thus an older contemporary of the Buddha). They are also from the same region in India. Both founders are held to be enlightened by their respective traditions, in fact in sculptures etc. both are quite often depicted in eerily similar meditating ascetic postures.

4. Cosmology

Eternal universe in both frameworks. Long line of Buddhas in Buddhism, long line of Tirthankaras in Jainism, with the Buddha and Mahavira just being the last, respectively. 

5. Scriptures

This point might be less important as it can probably be easily explained with language, but guess how Jainist scriptures are referred to? Agamas.

6. Enlightenment

Jainism also believes escape from Samsara to be the goal and this is through reaching liberation, which they call ""moksha"". By reaching enlightenment, you become an arhat according to Buddhism. Jainism calls enlightened people ""jina"".

7. Morality

Both spiritual paths have their own distinct nuances, but generally it can be said that they both preach nonviolence, truthfulness, the avoidance of sexual misconduct and non-attachment.

---

Now, anyone can argue for the differences and show that they are quite distinct religions - of course they are. But the point I'm making concerns the many-many similarities between the two that reveal both having been developed from the same formulaic pattern of thought... which is not a good sign for an _absolute truth_ claim in any case and makes the sceptic in me suspicious.

Giving Homeless People Money,"I'm curious to know if people give homeless people money when they ask for it. It's kind of confusing because the Right Action might be to help them. But saying no can have Right Intention because it helps them want to independently work towards happiness. Today and yesterday I had someone ask me for money and they usually phrase it ""Do you have a dollar?"" not ""Can you spare a dollar?"" and I understand that some people don't have the language skills to put that out, but when they ask me ""Do you have a dollar?"" I say no (which feels like a lie because I do and I don't like lying). It would be more wonderful if they could ask the other way around, but we are all here to fix our actions and not other people. Sometimes I do give them a dollar or spare food/water. Anyways, is there a better way to phrase ""I don't have a dollar."" without it possibly escalating the situation and telling the truth?

Validate My Enlightenment,"I have this state of being right now. I realized the true illusion that is my will. There is no me that controls anything. Life is a ride, and it is my job to experience and perceive the thoughts and experiences that is this sentience that ""I"" am. The reason why I suffered in the past was because this mental construct of ""I"" tried to control what it could not truly control. I know that I am one with ""God"" and so is everyone I see. The ego tried to much to call things its own, ""I"" am moving my arm right now, ""I"" am thinking these thoughts right now...just a false mental construct.

I realized this during this week. 

But my ego still shines through sometimes, will the transition become complete? Will my ego dissipate as the now continues to evolve? I still desire to bring people to this state.

"Don't get angry when it's not important, don't let it slip when it is.","I write a lot about welcoming anger, and it's for one reason: Most people in here are introverted, and anger is a ""taboo"" emotion. 

But when something like this happens with whatever emotion, there's imbalance; and thus we suffer.

If you don't start to allow yourself to speak out and vent that repressed anger, you will one day explode. More than so, we learn to manage emotions like we learn everything else: Thru experience. If you never experience anger, specifically because you repressed it, you will never learn it.

It is indeed a ver dangerous emotion, and very negative. But it's part of your colour palette, and you need to start painting with it.

Anger is something quite easy to give into. It is like salt, too much and you spoil food. But without anger you can't defend what must be defended, you can't attack and end samsaric conditions, or improve yourself. So it's quite necessary.

Why do so many Americans cut ties with their parents?,"There's been lots of posts on here on this exact topic.

This article in the Economist says it could be more than 1 in 3 Americans could cut all contact with a parent or close family member

The article suggests part of the reason could be people going online and deciding that their parents are abusive and says that just as we shouldn't assume all parents who say that they are great parents are we shouldn't assume when people say their parents are awful that they necessarily are as their adult children describe.

I put this under ""practice"" as a big part of Buddhist practice is managing relationships with ones parents/kids and partner and so forth.

Now I don't know alot but I know basic's about It. 

Buddha created over a long time the rightful 8 fold path and the 4 noble truths.

I have a few questions as whole?

Origins how did it all start?
Life of buddha before he was enlightened? 
Beliefs on stuff like safe sex? Alcohol, tabacco, diet, abortion, drugs (In moderation.)

Can someone give me a guided  tour/lecture on Buddhism belief's orgins storys and practises. 

Would really help If someone could teach me the faith as I went along.

Aswell Yes what does the term 'Nivarna' actually mean?

From my best of knowledge Is It a place of Happiness beyond human recognition. 

I know apparently If you banish all anger Hatred Selfishness and Greed you alledgedly reach 'Nivarna'. 

I'm not quite sure about selfishness but I know It's bad from a moral point of view. 

Greed, extreme promiscuity, Hatred I think are the biggest thing keeping you from the best place realm or feeling It would be like stopping your chance's of reaching the Chrstian Heaven.

So bassically Nivarana Is a place of great Natural happiness without angel's and all of that.

It's a spirtual realm so happy and devoid of misery and pain but without the heaven like feautures God ect.

What rationalisations square the perfection of nirvanna with the imperfection of a 2500 year old unbroken male lineage?,"Disclaimer

Although Buddhsim, or more specifically meditation and Buddh*ists*, have profoundly changed my life, I am deeply sceptical of many of traditional Buddhism's claims. I very much position myself as secular, though I do have a degree in Religious Studies. I don't believe in karma, rebirth nor enlightenment. However I'm sincerely commited to an ethical life and absolutely acknowledge the potential for personal and spritual transformation.

So I admit my question is already biased. However, I'm currently writing a book about the popular perception of enlightenment where I use Buddhism's unbroken male lineage as an argument for the possibility of nirvanna's over-stated definition. As I'm sure you can relate it's all too easy to get lost in your own strongly held opinions, so I'm just looking for some genuine counter arguments to help balance my perspective.

"SGI's President Ikeda's ultimate aim to ""realize Soka Kingdom""","Many people are deceived (or even prefer) to only see the ""bright shiny - everything is wonderful"" side that organizations work incessantly to show to prospective members and followers.  Before making any decisions regarding joining, remaining, or leaving a religious organization, it is a good idea to first do some independent in-depth research on the past history of the organization and its leader(s).  This pragmatic step is necessary to offset dogma and propaganda generated by religious organizations designed to entice enrollment and donations, and is an especially crucial step to take with organizations that have degenerated into using cult dynamics.  Religious cults are very adept at employing subtle mind control techniques while deftly covering up their unsavory histories and ulterior agendas from members or from public scrutiny.  With that in mind, the SGI and it's president for the last 54 years, Mr. Ikeda, deserve a much closer look.  

Ikeda's SGI claims to be a benevolent religious organization seeking only to spread Nichiren Buddhism and World Peace. However, researching historical archives plainly reveals Ikeda's hidden goal of creating a ""Soka Kingdom"", while placing himself as a monarchical ruler over his kingdom, and, generates substantial doubts regarding their claims of innocent benevolence.   

Let's examine his own incriminating words to discern the true nature and goals of the self-proclaimed fascist monarch, King Ikeda. Below are some very revealing quotes regarding ""Realizing the Soka Kingdom"" from the megalomaniac himself.

Quotes from SGI President Ikeda:

ON SOKA DOMINATION;
"" We must place the Soka Gakkai members in all the key positions of Japanese government and society. Otherwise Kosenrufu (world peace) will not be accomplished. ""
September 6th 1957, Seikyo Shimbun ( SG's daily organ newspaper )

ON TAKING OVER JAPAN
"" I feel the time to take over Japan has come close. A party that can't take the rein of the government need not exist. But don't worry. Here, I am behind the (Komei) party. ""
November 16th 1976, Photo gathering with members of the SGI's Komei political party

ON BECOMING KING & DISCARDING SGI
"" What I learned (from the second president Toda) is how to behave as a monarch. I shall be a man of the greatest power. The Soka Gakkai may be disbanded then. "" (The Soka Gakkai is just an instrument for Ikeda power quest.)
July 1970 issue of Japanese monthly magazine ""Gendai"" (English: the present age)

ON CONTROLLING THE ECONOMY
"" In the process of (our) Kosenrufu activity, the SG political party (Komei), the SG schools, the Bunka (SG's cultural organization), and the Minon (SG's entertainment business organization) have been founded. The last yet unaccomplished (revolution) is the economy. From now on, we members of the Shachokai (a group which consists of CEOs from Soka Gakkai front companies) shall create an economic revolution. ""
June 25th 1967, the 1st Shachokai meeting

ON POWER PLAY
"" Extend our power inconspicuously, set up networks in the industrial world.""  
"" Yasuhiro Nakasone (former Japanese Prime Minister) is not a significant matter. He is just a boy on our side. When he asked me to help make him Japanese Prime Minister, I said "" Okay, Okay, I'll let you be a Prime Minister. ""
November 25th 1967, the 6th Shachokai meeting

ON POLICE CORRUPTION
"" My men manipulating (the) police are Takeiri and Inoue. ""
July 8th 1968, the 13th Shachokai meeting

ON BEING GOD/KING
""To found the Soka Nation, the Soka Kingdom, on earth, in the universe, I shall protect Soka Gakkai members.""
The Second Head Quarter Meeting in Tokyo, June 10 1975

ON LOVE OF FASCISM (combined state & corporate power)
""To tell the truth, fascism is my real ideal.""
The 61st Executives Meeting, June 15 1972

ON BEING ABLE TO CONQUER JAPAN
"" The Soka Gakkai would then be dissolved. ""
July 1970 issue of Japanese monthly magazine ""Gendai""

ON MISUSING TEMPLE AS MASK TO DISGUISE SGI AS TRADITIONAL BUDDHISM
""The main temple Taisekiji is a sacrifice for the Soka Gakkai. The Soka Gakkai is most important of all. ""
The second Headquarter Meeting in Tokyo, June 10 1975


In short, the Soka Gakkai's (under Ikeda's control since 1960) unscrupulous ambitions are an attempt to completely rule Japan (and possibly an effort to create a template for future use to eventually dominate other nations as well) in a multifaceted way.

That is,

1. Spiritually: Make all the Japanese belong to Soka Gakkai.

2. Politically: Have the SG's Komei Party take the rein of the Japanese government.

3. Economically: Have business enterprises affiliated with Soka Gakkai control Japanese financial circles.

4. Have Soka Gakkai members slip into key positions of Japanese society, including administrative organs, the Ministry of Justice, the media, educational organizations, cultural organizations, etc., then take control of Japan.

5. Then finally, Daisaku Ikeda will become a man of absolute power to rule Japan.

Ikeda's ambitions are not merely big talk by a megalomaniac. Actually, the Soka Gakkia's own political force, the Komei-to Party (thanks in part to its merger with another party) has become the the most powerful party in the Japanese Diet's House of Representatives - its increased success is in direct proportion to the increase of millions of Soka Gakkai members. Elite individuals, who are members of the Soka Gakkai such as lawyers, prosecutors, judges, accountants, policemen, diplomats, government officials, etc., have already penetrated into Japanese society. The number of those elites has continuously increased. Ikeda and the Soka Gakkai's plot to take over Japan has been advancing steadily so far.


The ugly truth is this: ""The Soka Kingdom"" comprises a terrible fascist nation. The ultimate cruelty is that Ikeda's followers, and even his organization are considered by him to be disposable in his quest to rule his kingdom. Building and maintaining power and control is what is most important to a despotic king.  

Ikeda's ""Soka Kingdom"" aims at realizing a dictatorship nation based on fascism with Ikeda wearing the dictator's crown.  There are many well-documented criminal acts committed by the Soka Gakkai, including the oppression of the freedom of publishing, the spurious substitution of votes, the wire tapping incident, the Recruit bribery case, The Jari Senpaku bribery case, and many more. If the Soka Gakkai's goals of taking over the government were to be fully realized, the use of violence, corruption, and injustice would be justified to protect the dictator Ikeda's privileges, honor, wealth, and his power.

This terrible plot, ""Realizing the Soka Kingdom"" can be said to be the ultimate goal that Ikeda and the Soka Gakkai, under a mask of religion, have been aiming at all along. Furthermore, the existence of the Soka Gakkai, for the fascist despot Ikeda is, after all, just a tool or base to take over the rein of the government.

Here is a man that is revered as the modern-day Buddha by his disciples.  But based solely on his own words, it becomes crystal clear - IKEDA IS THE OVERLY AMBITIOUS TYRANT KING OF HIS EXPANDING 'SOKA KINGDOM', WHOSE TRUE OBJECTIVE IS TO BECOME A DESPOTIC RULER OVER A FASCIST JAPANESE GOVERNMENT. 

No need to take my word on this.  Read the quotes. Do your own independent research on Ikeda, the SGI, and what ""Realizing the Soka Kingdom"" means for the nation of Japan. Check out the unexpected turn toward fascism and war that is happening right now within the Japanese government whose Constitution prohibits Japan from waging war. Free speech is under a serious repressive attack by the right wing government in the wake of the Fukushima scandal.  The movement to return Japan to fascism is quickly gaining ground.  Find out who (or what political party) is generating this movement to fascism.  Think about the dire consequences that happened to Japan and the world last time it embraced fascism. Form your own opinions, and make up your own mind.  Remain independent - do not rely on SGI doctrine to uncover the hidden facts and figures (for instance, as a member, you will not hear this fact from the cult.org - the SGI pulls in around 2 billion dollars a year!).  If you are content to continue on with the SGI regardless of the hidden past or the buried facts - fine.  

But if you have doubts or reservations, please remain extremely cautious of any covert or overt influence or pressure on you to join or remain committed to the SGI.  Do your research. Carefully re-evaluate / re-assess your own relationship with the organization and it's cultish demands for members to declare Ikeda as their personal mentor (master). IF you have not ceded your ability to think for yourself to this power/control hungry cult, you may have a lot to gain and little to lose by acknowledging your intuitive ""second thoughts"" about becoming or remaining a member of this rich, powerful, and control-obsessed organization.  Nothing in life is cost-free. Those so-called fantastic benefits that are so loudly touted and advertised at introduction meetings don't come without a high price to pay. Buyer beware! Remember the old adage, ""if its too good to be true - it probably is.""        


An un-enslaved spirit... 

This post is intended to establish published quotes and facts, generate thoughtful discussion, and function as both a warning and a wake up call to those exposed to or under the influence of the SGI's powerful propaganda machine.  Sometimes the truth is very difficult to accept. It was for me. As Mark Twain famously said, ""It is much easier to fool human beings than to convince them they have been fooled.""  Legitimate on topic discussion and questions are always welcome.  Thanks.

I need honest opinions about my pregnancy loss story,"TW: Pregnancy Loss no follow up scans

What is your opinion on this story?

How should I view this situation? 

Please. I genuinely need to talk to some people here. 

I love my partner very much. We have been together for years 

My long term partner found out she was pregnant

She was having seriously bad cramping for a few days and then some normal pregnancy spotting.

She went to an unplanned sexual health clinic at 7 weeks but was told the embryo was 6 weeks and had no heartbeat.. was offered induced medical miscarriage pills and she took them after only one scan. No follow up scans. 

I don't know how I should feel.

She told me she would never have done it if there was a heartbeat ( the ultrasound showed no heartbeat )

Part of me feels that we could have waited longer to take the pills just incase..and that we should have followed up as ive heard it CAN be too early to confirm at 6-7 weeks if they see a HB.

I am in shock.. 

She was in a lot of pain... How should I view this situation? 

I can't live with myself if I know we ended the pregnancy but she said she felt ok taking the pills cos there was no heartbeat found on the ultrasound at 6 weeks when she was 7 weeks since LMP

There was no heavy bleeding but there was a lot of pain ( stronger than period cramps ) 

She seems absolutely fine..but I'm in turmoil. That was my child too.

She says she was in pain and that there was no heartbeat at the ultrasound and she would not have carried on if she had found out it had a heartbeat.

Was she morally justified to take these pills given the information she was presented but this was at a private clinic not a doctor's office? There was no follow up.

Honestly I love this girl but this changed me. I'm anxious 24/7 now.

Is marijuana intoxicating?,"I think our initial intuition to this question says, ""Yes, obviously,"" but there's something different about marijuana (and lsd and psilocybin for that matter). The difference is that marijuana is not toxic. 

I think the initial intuition regarding the fifth precept is that we should refrain things that impair our facilities of mind. Now, there is literature which suggests that marijuana impairs short term memory, but maybe we're not seeing the effects of marijuana ""intoxication"" as they really are.

The main point that leads me to wonder that marijuana might not be intoxicating is that marijuana is not toxic.

Push for diversity in Western Buddhism is missing the point of Buddhism in my opinion,"lionsroar has been putting out these articles about inclusion in Western Buddhism.  Here is an example:

 [https://www.lionsroar.com/the-infrastructure-of-inclusion/](https://www.lionsroar.com/the-infrastructure-of-inclusion/) 

A quote from the article:

"" This practice of radical inclusivity requires robust feedback loops that promote active, intentional learning efforts. For example, when we noticed that POC attendance percentages were falling, POC community members felt that we needed to support white practitioners to develop skills for navigating a diverse sangha. This led to a six-month class series for white folks that is now in its fifth year. We are also turning our attention to the unique impact of patriarchy, so as to develop programs that incorporate a more complex understanding of intersectionality. ""

To me, this is kind of Western super liberal politically correct nonsense that has nothing to do with Buddhist teachings.  By tracking and then trying to solve the ""problem"" of POC attendance, you are just strengthening an attachment to self.  Someone's race, gender, or sexual orientation becomes their identity and whatever group they fall into is more important than anything else.  

I want a Sangha to be completely open to different races, sexualities, genders, etc.  But to make a point of tracking attendance metrics and worrying about if they are hitting some made up quota of what a diverse Sangha should look like is completely missing the point.  Why can't you just go to a meditation meeting without focusing on what groups people may fall into?  If someone wants to bring up specific problems relating to their own race, gender, sexual identity, etc. that is great and it should be discussed.  But don't make it some sort of necessity because you have ideas about society and how things should be.",Buddhism,1568567663.0,t3_d4ncyc,0.57,6

For context there are many students of Lama Ole that have difficult circumstances with muslims. Many want advice about it and are searching for solutions. His usual advice is to inform yourself about the koran, islamic history and islamic societies.

In this subreddit I could mostly find criticism about Diamond Way. Its not actively discussed other then being called a cult whenever somebody is searching for a buddhist group.

I had a good exchange in this thread 18 days ago, about my issue with that.

Other than that I could find a few posts and comments with only negative comments.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/rppl34/diamond\_way\_centers\_and\_idolatry/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/rppl34/diamond_way_centers_and_idolatry/)

The Diamond Way community is obviously not very active on this sub. I can understand that. Most of what I find here is very one sided. It is like an accumulation of all negative one can see or interpret. Even from an outside perspective Diamond Way is very successful. Through the many centers and activities of Lama Ole, easily a hundred thousand people in the west took refuge. Today thousands are active practitioners that visit the centers regularly and practice the Guru Yoga of the 16th Karmapa. Of course I can't tell how everybody is doing on their way. But from what I observed people get more compassionate and wise. I have seen many people change their difficult life. They get very idealistic and try to make use of buddhist practice wherever they are. Even more people don't practice but are touched by the activity of Lama Ole and his students. For many it is an easy possibility to hear about the buddha and his teachings. Some may not like the style or the people but we try to show the compassion and wisdom of buddhism. If somebody doesn't fit, there are many more buddhist groups in the west, as we all can see in this sub. 

The most important fact is Diamond Way and Lama Ole Nydahl are under the patronage of Karmapa Trinley Thaye Dorje. There is active exchange between Diamond Way and other organizations under the Karmapa. Things are changing organically (for example there is no alcohol allowed in the centers anymore) and Lama Ole and the organization represent most of the lay buddhists under the Karmapa. 

I think it boils down to some acceptance between the Karmapa candidates. In the past there was a lot of tension between the two sides. Both candidates want to mend the wounds of that. I think a part of this is to accept each other. I think going around and talking that the other side is not really buddhist is not very useful. My thought is that we should see the merits both sides have and continue on our path. Of course that doesn't mean I only want to read bad things others think about my teacher. 

So my question is:

The acceptance of the mixing of Buddhism with Christianity,"I get it. Christianity is the dominant religion in the west. But i am also an ex christian who has seen too much. I cannot agree with the mixing of a religion that has caused so much pain and suffering with one that teaches you to overcome pain and suffering. I know many people compare Jesus to Buddha, but good people dont get crucified. I know ill get some flak for this, but i disagree with That Nich Hahn, to my way of thinking, if you want to be a Buddhist, be a buddhist, but Christianity should never enter into the equation, because christianity is a different religion with different ideals, rules and laws.

Buddhism podcasts in English featuring non-white hosts?,"Hello!

On Leaving Online Buddhist Communities ‚Äî A Word of Advice,"I posted something along these lines sometime last year, but in time I came back. However, I've decided definitively that not only /r/buddhism but all online sanghas are a waste of time. I'm writing this to provide a last word of advice. For the record, I will not receive notifications about this to my inbox.

It's in vogue lately to insist that the internet can be a force for good. I've acquiesced that this is not possible. We wanted to be born as humans, and unskillful speech is par for the course of a human existence. Of course, we should strive for skillful speech in our own affairs, and treat others with respect and basic dignity regardless of their background, but that's on us to do the work of the religion.

That said, none of us here are arhats: Dan Ingram and Kenneth Folk's hyperbolic ramblings to the contrary. We are all ignorant to varying degrees. Some of us are real bastards who conflate being Asian with being a good Buddhist, and openly advocate killing Muslims in the name of defending family or culture without any sense of shame. Regarding killing, *you* cannot know for certain whether someone with a knife or a gun means to kill you or not. But if *you* kill that person, *you* know you have killed *them*, and *you* have hurt *yourself*.

The simple fact is that I have strong conviction in what the Buddha taught. I believe many of us come to these online communities because we have something to prove to ourselves: that this identity we've fashioned for ourselves is valid. But what do you do when you no longer feel the need to prove your convictions are valid? You set it aside, and you do the work that you need to do.

I encourage you all to make a similar investigation. I will not be visiting this subreddit any further. If you have any questions about the practice, you can address them as a PM to me, /u/Pathos315.",Buddhism,1462928484.0,t3_4ish5a,0.48,0
"I think Buddhism and Christianity are very similar religions/philosophies with the same message, just in another cultural and social environment","Now, ignore everything about the institutionalized version of Christianity, including the Catholic church, popes, bishops, crusades, wars and ignorant laws, since they are rather products of society and human ignorance, greed and other political & economic goals.

I think that Jesus is basically the Western (Middle-Eastern) Buddha. I think his story should not be taken literally, but rather as symbolic messages. 

Virgin Mary might represent innocence and moral purity. He was not literally the son of 'God', and 'God' itself should not be imagined as a talking lunatic residing in the clouds, but rather as the Universe itself.

My interpretation is that Jesus was very similar to Buddha. Buddha was from a noble family living in a palace, Christ was from a regular family living in a town - Buddha was intended to become a king, Jesus was intended to become a carpenter by their families.

The kicker comes next, they both somehow realize they aren't really happy in this repeating cycle (Samsara) and are suffering (dukkha), so both of them withdraw from society, Buddha starts meditating and Jesus starts praying.

They both realize the true nature of suffering - in Buddhism, Dukkha, in Christianity, Sin - Buddha finds Enlightenment, Jesus becomes the Son of God - symbolically One with the Universe.

They both began teaching about the right path, love, tolerance and the release of material wealth and desire, and gain followers and found their own churches. Jesus later gets executed by the Roman Empire, which might be interpreted as him becoming a Boddhisatva.

I think Heaven is basically the same as Nirvana, Finding God is the same as Enlightenment and Praying is the Western equivalent of Meditation, and the main goal of both religion is finding inner peace within the Samsara and achieving Nirvana.

Of course, this is only my personal interpretation, which might not be entirely correct.",Buddhism,1438240973.0,t3_3f4uv4,0.48,0

The Hate Against Soka Gakkai Nichiren Buddhism is Unjustified,"I am a lifelong practitioner of Nichiren Buddhism as an SGI member, and although my interest in the practice has ebbed and flowed over time, on the whole, I feel very grateful to this practice for helping me understand Buddhism and make sense of suffering and the challenges of life in this world. I feel that the message and practice of Nichiren Buddhism is very profound and meaningful. I like the community and gain great strength from the daily practice of chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo and gongyo (recitation of sections of the Lotus Sutra). I try my best, as a lay practitioner, to maintain a daily practice, and ponder about the utility and value of Buddhism in my daily life.

However, I feel that many people on the internet hate the SGI and Nichiren Buddhism a bit too much. SGI isn't perfect, but neither is it as bad as many people online suggest. A lot of the aspersions against the SGI are derived from bad tabloid journalism or anonymous posts on the internet. There is a great deal of conspiracy theorizing, rumor and gossip when discussing the SGI on sites like SGI Whistleblowers. Sometimes, it is fear of the unknown. That is not to say that all negative experiences that people have had with the group are illegitimate - indeed, individual encounters with members and leaders and the practice may have had issues for a variety of reasons. SGI has made mistakes, especially in earlier decades, and it remains a work in progress.

I, for one, remain grateful for it. It has connected me with the message of Buddhism, and introduced me to some great people, who have helped me at various points in my life. As a gay man who struggled with his identity as a teenager, I drew strength both from SGI's inclusivity as well as from the teaching of universal enlightenment that all human beings, regardless of any distinction, have the Buddha nature inherent within themselves, which they can polish through a regular and consistent practice, among other things. SGI Nichiren Buddhism is derided as materialistic, but this is untrue. Firstly, using the Buddhist practice for conspicuous benefits, although looked down upon by some Western Buddhists, is common in various parts of Asia. As such, living in the world in which material existence can be so challenging, deriving conspicuous benefits, can connect greatly with ordinary people (the poor, the sick, etc.) who may not have the mind space to think about greater things. Beyond that, however, the aim in Nichiren Buddhism and the SGI is to transform our desires, and to ultimately accumulate ""treasures of the heart"" and inconspicuous benefits, which will be valuable through the cycle of birth, death and rebirth. I encourage fellow Buddhists and indeed everyone to engage with this aspect of Buddhist philosophy. SGI members are often some of the less materialistic people among the people I know.

In Nichiren Buddhism, this world, and the transformation of life and suffering in the world we live in is crucial. We need to make it a Buddhaland (not defined as the universal acceptance of Buddhism, but rather the values that it is based on), and work towards alleviating suffering. This is the message of Mahayana Buddhism - not only working towards our own enlightenment/Buddhahood, but also of our fellow living beings. I feel that SGI and Nichiren Buddhism deserve more respect than it receives, and certainly less hate and backlash than it gets, based on incomplete and often false narratives and ideas.

I really don't understand... why ?,"# 1 ) To all people who say that they believe in karma, but not rebirth.

How does this logic even properly function at all ? If there is no rebirth, then what would you explain about whatever phenomena comes after a being on Earth dies ? Or before a being was born ? And by your logic, you also mean all beings that have just been born, have zero prior karma at all right ? Okay so let's assume that's true. Every being is born equal. Then how do you explain the unequality in form, environment and other elements about each of these beings ? Why are some born as animals like worms and pigs, while some are born rich - poor - or with physical - mental problems ? And evil people who do evil deeds, after they die, they get away from karmic debts for free right ?

I'm legit so confused by this logic. Karma and rebirth, to me, can't NOT exist together, without one another. If you have any plausible explanation as to why some people can even think like this logic at all, please comment down below to enlighten my ignorance.

I legit have seen this statement by many people so many times and my mental capability fail to comprehend the logic process behind it everytime.

# 2 ) To all people who say that ""Why aren't evil people punished by karma for their evil deeds ? Karma is fake/ unfair ?""

Umm this life isn't the only life we've experienced. Because unenlightened sentient beings experience rebirth so there are past lives and future lives, and who knows such evil people we see right now, did good deeds in past lives so they reap the sweet fruits they sowed in the past ? Of course their current evil deeds will lead them to pay the debt of bad karma in the future or future lives. Karma is NOT INSTANT justice system lol. There are conditions in between the cause and effect, which takes time. If it was instant and so obvious, people from millenials ago would've easily learned about its existence to do good, avoid bad. 

Also, karma doesn't work straight and directly 1 to 1 like, say, if a thief kills you to steal your cash, that doesn't necessarily mean you did something like that in a past life so now you're paying for it. That's a false assumption. We unenlightened beings have no knowledge about our past lives so these bold assumptions are dangerous and can lead people to wrong views.

What I'm trying to explain about the example above is like this. It could very likely be that: You don't have any bad karma like that in a past life to deserve to be killed and stolen as such. But, at that moment, at that place, that thief DECIDES to commit the crime by himself, and thus he created the evil deeds. Maybe you were just unfortunate somehow to be the victim who just happens to be at that moment, at that place, and the thief sees you as a target to commit the crime. Thus, the thief will reap the fruit of the evil karma he did in the future or future rebirth.

Samsara is dukkha,"Birth is dukkha. Aging is dukkha. Sickness is dukkha. Death is dukkha. As long as we are in the samsara cycle, there is dukkha.

As sad as the situation in Ukraine is right now, and as difficult as the issue of violence and defence is all the while, perhaps it is timely we self-reflect just what buddhism is about, and just what we have actually been saying and doing in the name of buddhism. Just so we are clear the buddhism we are practising.

I'm not a buddhist and I don't know the doctrines well. But I understand that buddhism is not ultimately about building karma. Because karma perpetuates samsara. It doesn't matter how supposedly 'good' a karma you tried to accumulate, as long as you are within the cycle of samsara, you will eventually be thrown into difficult situations like that of being a Ukrainian being attacked by invaders, or that of being an immediate witness to your sister being gang-raped and violated by a group of guys and she pleading for you to help. What are you going to do?

There is no true safety in samsara. This is dukkha. This is samsara.

So it's perhaps important to keep in mind that buddhism isn't simply focused about escaping bad karma (which is what many of the conversations recently focus on), and especially so in intentionally calculating karma with regards to self.

As long as we are training our mind to intentionally try to calculate karma (I don't know how that works out), and specifically calculate in terms of self interest, whatever conducive conditions of practice you find yourself in, present or in the future, will not help much, because you are just entrenching yourself deeper and deeper in samsara and dukkha.

Just like many of us now sitting and resting in the safety of our homes without bullets and bombs and aggressive invaders attacking us. How much of this conduciveness are you actually making use of to practice?

For those who finally have some appreciation of samsara and dukkha, and with the necessary disenchantment and thus sincerity in practice, there is the path of renunciation. And that is why we have monastic institutions to offer some protection for these renunciants. So that they don't have to get too involved with unconducive situations, and that they may fervently and wholeheartedly dedicate to practice.

The precepts, just like the monastic institutions, are also meant to protect. To help prevent the practitioners from getting involved in unconducive conditions. But these are not true refuge. These are not true safety from samsara.

The true refuge is that of nirvanic mind. It is realised through knowing the truth of samsara, of dukkha, of self. Technically you don't escape samsara and dukkha. The goal is actually relasation - awakening/enlightenment. Seeing through them for what they are - samsara, dukkha, self etc.

So karma and supposedly conducive conditions are just that. If we remain ignorant and deluded, we are just going to waste them and perpetuate samsara. If we are wakeful and mindful, every moment can be a moment of enlightenment.

Such that even when a man is spraying his machine gun on a crowd of people, you will not be stuck trying to calculate karma intentionally in terms of self interest, you will not be stuck in a simplistic binary mode of decision-making of that of killing that man or allowing that man to kill you.

There's a wide range of possibilities available in that situation, and it's open when we don't fixate in simplistic binary thinking and when we don't fixate simply to calculating karma of self-interest. It's open when all the while we have been making use of the conducive conditions we are given to practise, to understand the truth of samsara and dukkha and self etc.

There is no safety in samsara. Whatever we do as deluded beings will have consequences. So even while it's important not to justify and advocate violence/killing, it's important also not to make easy comments on intentional calculation of karma with regards to self interest from the comfort of our chair during a sensitive time like this. Don't advocate things you probably aren't capable of doing when placed in difficult situations.

This is a good time for self-reflection and to ask ourselves just what we have been saying and doing. If we aren't wise and capable enough to handle difficult topics yet, offer goodwill and compassion and encouragement to people who are suffering right now.

Dangers of astral travelling/OBE,"Hi everyone

I have been meditating for a while now(usually before sleeping) and this causes me to wake up after some hours of sleep and enter that physical state that precedes the out of body experience.

I managed to astral travel only once by pure chance and for me it was nothing but a beautiful experience because I thought about the cemetery where my grandma was buried but it the astral body made it seem a totally different and blissful place.

After searching for some more informations I encountered some videos and websites that advice against astral travel and say that if you don't believe in Jesus you will get possessed by demons or other entities.

I would really like to explore more dream yoga because I think is the right path for me but first I would like to ask you how to correctly behave from a buddhist point of view during these out of body experiences and if it is really dangerous to do them.",Buddhism,1552079018.0,t3_ayvasr,0.5,0
This will be a VERY unpopular opinion but new people should read it. People complain too much on here. We're not magic.,"But I'm done pretending. As said by the Buddha basically, if it has good true intention he said it, even if someone didn't like it.

Somebody asked about addiction help on here earlier. They didn't like responses. Someone asked about this, that and the other thing. A couple didn't like responses.

You cannot just hop on a Buddhist subreddit and crap on people because you ask a question and don't like the replies.

Sure Buddhism is about the end of suffering but I honestly feel people misinterpret what suffering is. We're not talking about crying because your cat got run over. It's not about hating living with your parents because your dad is sometimes mean. It's a whole other level of suffering.

At the same time some very valid Buddhist things are brought up and people get upset about them. One thing I've done a lot of googling about if jhana. I found a lot of reddit posts with negative replies. Sorry folks but it's a big part of it, deal with it.

I feel like Buddhism is becoming a tool for those that don't wish to address their lives directly and are instead looking for some quick fix.

This doesn't exist in any religion. Even Christianity and alike where things are quickly ""forgiven"" and God shows you the way. I'm not knocking that religion but we all know honestly a lot of people sell it like that.

If you're addicted to drugs, quit.

If your dad sucks, leave. Don't say there's not a way, there always is. Worst case scenario, call the cops.

Girlfriend being mean? Dump her.

Want to kill something and justify it (like the other person that didn't like the response earlier) I'm sorry but that's just not Buddhist. Don't look to us for justification.

Not sure of what to do with your life? Neither are we lol. To an extent yes but in the bigger picture, we're all figuring it out.

Water flooded your basement? Get an insurance agent.

I think we get the point.

I'm not sure why so many people come here with trivial problems and get upset when they don't get an answer they like. I'll admit I'm in the ""don't like"" (complainers that don't address their issues) category but it's honestly not just about me. I see countless (at this point) good replies from other folks downvoted. Do you guys remember what downvotes are for? No? They are for topics that do not apply to the situation, not things that don't stroke your ego.

So the next time someone complains about their wife leaving them and stealing their trailer and dog like a sad country song, think about it. Don't encourage it! You're upvoting crap that has nothing to do with Buddhism and making it so more people fill this subreddit with junk.

I know Buddhism stresses compassion but it's hard to truly practice compassion for those that intentionally pervade and strive in ignorance. Like non-self, compassion is not a simple phrase that means the first thing you jump to. It's part of the bigger picture too. When it comes to trivial life issues, YOU need to address them. WE ALL DO. Buddhism cannot save you IF YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO SAVE YOURSELF!!!!

Buddhism is seen as a philosophy to some. Others a religions. Others a way of life. I like to combine all three but tell me, what other philosophy, religion or way of life instantly solves your problems?

Buddhism is a good REMINDER to address your issues but, it cannot save you if you do not try.

I wish people would see that.

Yes I suppose I'm being selfish. It's because I've limited time and come on here to read Buddhist things, not psychiatric issues.

I'm turning off inbox replies. I've said what I had to say. I hope some of you think about it.

Do you disapprove of stepping on bugs - why or why not?,"I'm 25 years old and have purposely stepped on bugs my whole life. Occasionally - rarely, a friend, acquaintance, or stranger will comment that what I'm doing is wrong or a sign of bad character or someone (usually a girl) will say I need to grow up. I've even heard people say that you can extrapolate how someone would act toward others based on their purposely squashing bugs for no reason. Once at a picnic I got up to throw something in the garbage, noticed a horde of ants bustling around a little ant mound, was sort of bored, so I lifted my foot over them and stamped it down. I sat back down and my buddy and I sort of snickered because I noticed my running shoes were full of mud and a ton of ants were now pressed deep into the maze-like treads and squirming about in their new rubber prison. Then out of nowhere some guy with another group who had seen me stepping on the ants called me a bully and ""inhumane"" because I step on ants. I replied to him by telling him to kiss my stinking feet, and which I guess is not that nice.

But at the same time, I believe I'm actually a pretty good natured guy to others. I volunteered as an EMT in college, treat others respectfully, believe in fair play when I run or swim competitively, I'm against scams, violence, etc. Most people I know consider me to be a pretty damn good guy.

I recognize some people believe in reincarnation, but I'm not one of them. So I don't see how stepping on bugs can be a sign of character. And if I really were stepping on someone's granny jane or their uncle bob, I guess my thoughts would be eh, better luck next time.

I'm an Eclectic Pagan and I incorporate Buddhist teachings and practices as well as Bodhisattvas. I wanted to share how I view these to get some feedback and comparison/contrast from all of you.,"So, to start off, I am an Eclectic Pagan, as I stated in the title. What that means for me is that I encorporate multiple spiritual beliefs, practices, and perspectives in order to make a more authentically personal system of my own.

I am also till debating whether or not, for me, if the devas/deities, bodhisattvas, elementals, etc have a physical form or if they are only a collective energy.

I wanted to see how all of you view Bodhisattvas as well as devas, in your own practices, for feedback and perspective purposes.

I have heard some say that bodhisattvas were actual beings whom strive to one day become buddhas; I've heard they are without form, etc. And am kind of confused on how buddhists view them, compared to my own perspective.

So I use mantras as a base for a majourity of my spiritual practice. When I, for example say Om Mani Padme Hum or Om Namo Bhagavate Sarva Durgate..., I feel the intent of that mantra and send it out into the Universe so that the intention can be fulfilled.

Which is a bit different than when I say the Medicine Buddha mantra ""Tayata Om Bekandze..."" wherein I usually have my animals or myself in mind,I am asking for the wellbeing and good health of myself or them to be restored. When I do this I feel like I am using the Bodhisattva as a conduit between myself and the Universal Energy (whatever energy can take away the suffering and restore health) which for me is usually the deity Gaia ( personification of the Earth Herself) Again ,I am growing with my practice and new theories and understandings of Deity change. 

But I guess my question is, do you see Green Tara, Medicine Buddha, Quan Yin, Shakyamuni, as real beings who ascended, primal energy like that of the cosmos (a star, nebula, atoms, neutrons,) a personification for our Higher Self (enlightened self), or something else?",Buddhism,1503902722.0,t3_6whqgx,0.5,0

Killed a crapload of flies this summer after 7 years of no killing,"Just curious what you think of this.

I am a dzogchen practitioner first and Namkhai Norbu did not have us take refuge formally with the Five Precepts, **but I do believe he thinks they are all important to maintain.**

He says mostly **""do your best""** and I think he keeps it this informal on purpose so that you won't break your vows.

He also says you can do whatever teaching you like if you think it will help you, so when I had the opportunity to take refuge formally and be connected to a vajrayana lineage, I did so.

I am sure over the years I have broken all 5 precepts, but not killing was one that I felt fairly easy to keep. I'm not sure exactly why breaking the others didn't bother me much. Like most people, I always find a way to rationalize an e-book heist (hey, I would have just bought it used, anyway, or borrowed it from the library; the publishers and the authors wouldn't have received a dime from that) and in the moment I am lying, I know there is a ""good reason for it."" Drinking? Dzogchen practitioners have no law against that.

Looking back on it, I find it extraordinarily unfortunate that I ever took the precepts formally because I simply opened up the opportunity to break them. I don't think I generated much merit from the act since I've done it. Although I've become a non-drinker and that vow is no longer hard to keep.

Anyway, last summer our house became insanely infested with flies. 12 in the morning, 30-something by the time we got home, even more the next day. There was no choice but to kill them. My wife was frustrated as hell (and terrible at killing them), so I finally decided to take some of this bad karma upon myself and kill them all. I said ""om mani padme hum"" as I did so and kept thinking to myself and making the wish almost like a magical pronouncement that these beings would be connected to the dzogchen lineage by the power of my intention and self-sacrifice in taking on negative karma for the good of all beings involved.

It took some thinking before I made this decision. **I won't explain my rationalization thoroughly because I see no reason to encourage other people go kill bugs.**

Just wondering your opinion. I killed probably 40 flies in all. Then, in the fall, I killed 3 or 4 mosquitos for the same basic reasons.

A reminder that we have a duty to other religions,"Recently, I've been seeing the occasional anti-Christian message. Instead of downvoting and being passive, let's try to correct wrong views with new wisdom.

Ashoka, the king who converted to Buddhism, has famously treated his subjects in his kingdom with respect to their religions. Not ""respect"" in the sense that many today see respect (i.e. ""I respect your religion as so far as you don't talk to me about it"") but actual, legitimate respect.

There was an edict enshrined by Ashoka, that still exists today, that had declared:

‚ÄúOne should not honour only one's own religion and condemn the religions of others, but one should honour others' religions for this or that reason.  So doing, one helps one's own religion to grow and renders service to the religions of others too.  In acting otherwise one digs the grave of one's own religion and also does harm to other religions.  Whosoever honours his own religion and condemns other religions, does so indeed through devotion to his own religion, thinking ""I will glorify my own religion"".  But on the contrary, in so doing he injures his own religion more gravely.  So concord is good: Let all listen, and be willing to listen to the doctrines professed by others.‚Äù",Buddhism,1392487538.0,t3_1xzufc,0.5,0

does anyone else think Christianity is a misinterpretation of Buddhism?,"edit: sigh, i hate my posts getting downvoted... especially when i feel like i've had some good conversation and learn quite a bit from it.  oh well, all i'm trying to do is learn and how else do you learn but to ask questions... if not silly or dumb questions?  thank you to everyone who replied

I saw an interesting [documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY0Ib3aPG6Y) about how Jesus might have actually been a Buddhist monk and it kind of opened my eyes.  I mean Jesus said he was son of god, that he was god, etc... and this makes sense from a Buddhist perspective right?  We are all god.  I now kind of think Christianity is just a misinterpretation of Buddhism.  I mean Buddhism is a bit abstract, the idea that we are and everything is god.  I can see someone get confused and personify god or maybe maliciously personifying god so that they can rule over people?  

I see similarities in praying vs meditation.  Its a bit simpler to think you are praying to a monothestic god, that praying the over encompassing universe.  

I dunno, just lately when someone says ""god bless you"" or something, i just kind of take it in a ""may the world/universe bless you"".  I have no desire to say ""i don't beleive in god"" anymore... because i do... i beleive in the universe and i personally feel that anything a Christian can share about god or their religion can be translated to a spiritual Buddhist-like perspective without offending the Christian.

Anybody else have any thoughts on this?  examples of similarities?  critiques?  i think this could be a fun conversation.

How can I verify if somebody is truly Enlightened?,"Lots of people have claimed Enlightenment, and many monks believe that they are Enlightened even though they are forbidden by precepts from claiming enlightenment. Even though the monks don't obviously claim their belief of Enlightenment, they still teach others what they think. The problem is that when we try to verify such person's teaching, they are able to deny responsibility for the result of what they taught because they didn't clearly claim any authority, even though, realistically, their claim of authority is implicit in their activities to teach others.

I believe that people should be able to know who they can learn the right way from. So I am wondering how I can determine whether someone really knows what they teach.

So my question is, how can I confirm whether someone is really Enlightened or not?

Are Mahayana Buddhists Worshipping Devas?,"Are Mahayana Buddhists worshipping devas? It seems like as Mahayana Buddhism spread throughout India and the rest of the world, it acculturated a lot of local deity/deva worship. These local deities or devas were then classified as Buddhas for the sake of providing a yidam/i·π£·π≠a-devatƒÅ and possibly for the sake of incorporating the local populace's pre-existing norms. I can see this quite prominently in the Tibetan tradition, where a figure like Tsong Kha Pa literally takes Saraswati as a yidam, or where Tara is revered as a Buddha, but may otherwise be perceived as a goddess in Hinduism. 

If I were to be charitable, I might say that the Mahayana is simply using these as immanent objects of concentration/reverence so that the individual practitioner may have a revelation of the transcendent. But if that is the case, then the practitioner could select a stone, or something that has no mindstream of its own (which a *deva does have*), or any old sentient being (because after all, even a deva is not a suitable refuge) . 

What do you think? Are there generations of Mahayana practioners worshipping devas under the assumption that they are Buddhas?

Buddhism and the Covid-19 Vaccination,"OK, I know we all heard enough about Covid-19 and the vaccines in the news and over the last 16 months already, but I need to ask this question!

First of all some things about me:

I'm 25 and currently living in Vienna, Austria, I started researching Buddhism about a year  ago. Turned Vegetarian about the same time! Buddhism was a light in the dark for me in the recent month and helped me to understand a lot of things going on in the world! But I still don't understand all of the traditions fully and that's why im asking this question:

Till this morning I  was 100% going to take the Covid-19 Vaccine as soon as I could. My believe is, that we are all connected on a higher spiritual level, which means, if I protect myself from Covid-19, I protect everyone I'm connected with! That's a kind of  basic belief I took from Buddhism and how to live my life. Correct me if I'm wrong here please!

Today Austria announced the ""Green Vaccination Passport"" and that every person having it will get back his rights, like visiting cinemas or night clubs. As it seems right now, Europe will introduce it soon afterwards as an international document.

I'm a defender of freedom and think we all should get back our normal lives as soon as possible! And of course, every single person at risk of dying from Covid-19 should be protected!But our Government does it by giving vaccinated people more rights than others. I basically feel like I'm forced to take the Vaccine now or otherwise won't be able to get back my rights.

I'd like to ask for your advice here. What's more important?Should I get vaccinated anyway to ensure my own and others safety and overlook the forced Passport?Or should I not get it because I feel like my rights get heavily violated with the forced Vaccination? It just feels like I would be doing it for the wrong reasons?

I know buddhism is not a forced religion and many things can be practiced different, but I¬¥d like to hear your opinion on this matter and maybe you know a similar situation in Buddhist Practicing where I could get a lead in the right direction!

Rebirth is a metaphor,"Hi all. I've posted here before, and I love lots of Buddhist teachings, but don't accept the supernatural claims such as gods or reincarnation.

&#x200B;

I'm also convinced that ""rebirth"" simply means ""to experience certain states of consciousness over and over again."" So for example, if the Buddha says, ""The way to avoid rebirth is to avoid the mental states that are associated with a new birth,"" such as anger, jealousy, hatred, etc. I don't see a reason to assume this ""rebirth"" is an entirely new body in a new life. Rather, it's talking about states of consciousness, right now. How many times have we gotten angry? Then we look back and say, ""Oh, that was stupid. I don't want to do that again."" And yet, later on, we forget, and we get angry again. That's a ""rebirth"" of anger. The SAME STATE of consciousness that you live once, you are forced to live again. Unless, of course, you start to see it so clearly through meditation that you give it up, and it's extinguished (nirvana). I also believe nirvana is a metaphor for when these strong, negative mental states are so diminished that they, for all practical purposes, disappear. Anyway, please tell me what you think!

I'd like to think that Buddha wasn't lying when he mentioned these and that the only disconnect between the texts and the current reality is that most of us just aren't achieving this yet, or have but have chosen to stay quiet about it.

"I have the ""knowing"" of my previous lives... I don't know where to go from this point. Should I keep this for myself? Will people think I am mad if I talk like that? I don't live in a Buddhist country...","I had a revelation two weeks ago during a meditation\*. It came to me, I saw my previous lives up until seeing the first light... splashing on the bottom of the sea. I was there during the times I write about, I saw the events unfold. I travelled to times when humanity lived in the bushes, I had fur on my lower body and hands. Felt the fear of not having fire. And so on throughout all time. I felt that paganism or the old religions connects us to the nature, the animals within us that we were/are, the divinity of nature in all forms and the processes around it and within, we need to be connected to nature to be ourselves. There is no goodness or badness in nature, there are only processes to harmonize. Then there is the enlightenment, the understanding that we are part of both the physical realm and infinite metaphysical realms, the Buddha understood and because the Hindus already understood that we are all gods and part of divinity, he could proliferate his message. The story of us being gods went different in the Western world, as we all know. We westerners are just too stuck in duality, even today.

I constantly met the same kind of people within my visions, like they were bound to me. Especially my partner. The effect of it was so strong that I do see people differently now, I have seen most of them before. We have entangled lives with some people throughout eternity (or what I concieve as eternity). This is just a fact now, everything has become very simple to me and actually I have gotten much more confident in myself, my anxiety has gone and ADHD is so much better. The difference is stark. I love it and my partner as well. We love this idea of eternity together.

&#x200B;

I  know psychadelics or toxins are not accepted by the buddha, however I really feel like I have deepened many of my meditations and my understanding of the universe within me and the totality. I grew up non-religious in a christianized country, I never connected to christianity and thought that was the only spirituality there was, so I became a scientist. Five years ago, I started mindfullness and I discovered things in me that I really love to explore. I am now consciously moving to Buddhistic readings, with some other religions and spirituality in the mix as well.

&#x200B;

After I started meditating, I realized that we are all part of a higher consciousness or ""the knowing"", I searched and found the writings of the Buddha about non-duality, being one and nothing. I have  been the darkness, or the thing in between the light/consciousness.

&#x200B;

The problem is...I have been seeing a therapist for ongoing relationship issues with my family and I suddenly feel a strong aversion to telling her my truth of my past lives. I did the mistake of telling her a bit, but immediately regretted it after I uttered the word. Nothing she did or said made me change my view, but I felt I had already done this mistake in the past, and paid the consequences in horrible way. I have been extrememly open with her about everything and she has been very helpful but I cannot let go of the fact that I feel I have put myself in danger.

What could happen if there is a file somewhere with this? Should I downplay this a quirk and never talk about this again? Am I too paranoid? What would you do/have you done after realizing your past lives?

To give context: I have had ""visions"" of different things since I was a teenager, apparently it is normal. In my culture the lines between nature, spirit, ancestors and yourself is not so clear. For example, my grandmother was somewhat of an oracle, who people would ask for opinions and guidance. She would never take money or anything like that, it was just something normal, like the healer of the village would guide with some pain soothing medicine or the teacher telling what books to buy. So I accept that this is my reality, or my understanding of it as a human now. It will be strange for me to keep this a secret.

I'm so tired of telling people I'm not a Buddhist,"This is a bit of a rant but I hope you can see it as an essay. 

Ever since my teens I've been interested in how our brain works. I wanted to become a Psychologist, and for the first time I really applied myself in School with good results. Then I started studying Psychology in HS. I was so excited to get the book for PS I read through it the first day looking for what I could do. I didn't find anything. There was Roscharsch (this was the 90's) and if you were an ""Anal"" or ""Oral"" personality type. Neither of these are in PS books today btw. Then I talked to our teacher, asking him what we could do. He said Psychology didn't work that way. So I asked him how it worked. He told me you could either work in research or therapy. ""Great"" I said, ""What do you do in therapy?"". Apparently you just listen to people talk about their problems. This can temporarily feel better but imho it's certainly not a long term resolution. Analyzing yourself is not a solution either because it doesn't teach you what you can do to feel better, which it seems is what people looking for therapy really want at the heart of it. 


I dropped out of HS and started working in IT instead. I became somewhat successful but I never had any real passion for it. So in the early 2000's I stumbled upon something, something more pragmatical which made sense. I think the most valuable thing I garnered from here was the ability to test, both logically and pragmatically, the value and/or quality of something. This means if I stumble upon a technique I can with some speed and accuracy determine if it's hogwash or not. This is when I got in contact with Buddhism on a more intimate basis. And by that I mean more than just history and basics that you might learn in School, but instead I got access to the more pragmatical parts of it. And I'm in awe. 



I tend to compartementalize Buddhism into 3 areas:


The religous part - Ending the cycle of rebirth


Philosophy - Here might be included to not hurt other beings, being humble etc. These might lead to actions but they are not really pragmatical in and of themselves


Techniques - Here's the meat (for me). This includes things such as Meditation, Mindfulness, Firebreath and so on. 


Now I consider Psychology as the Buddhism of the west. But it's pretty horrible. There are very few techiques and the only Philosophically oriented tips I've heard are ""Don't just rely on one thing in your life, you need to do more things. Have several hobbies, several friends and several things you are interested. Don't rely on just one person such as your gf."" That's it. In fact it's so bad most studies aren't even repeatable: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/scientists-replicated-100-psychology-studies-and-fewer-half-got-same-results-180956426/


Now I don't know why we don't teach Buddhism in School. There at least 2 parts of Buddhism that are of much higher quality than anything that the west has produced, in fact, as far as I can tell the west has not produced anything new that's not already been mentioned in Buddhism. Flow? It's in Buddhism. Focus/Attention? It's in Buddhism. Etc. Now I know some of you, becaus I've written about this before here, don't consider Buddhism scientific. But I disagree with that, Buddhism is in fact highly scientific. Buddhism, as far as I can tell, is very experimental. They test things and if the results aren't good they drop it and do something else. This is why 5000 years of tradition have produced so many effective methods. 


And this is why it pisses me off so much why this stuff isn't taught in Schools. Can you imagine teaching meditation and mindfulness to all children every day from a young age? The amount of impact this would have on our society would be absolutlely massive and totally unpredictable. And the rest of these childrens school attendance would be dramatically improved. The ""information stuffing"" would go easier and they would probably become a lot better at being autodidactic. 


Now the reason I titled this the way I did is because when I talk to students I often mention Buddhism and as a result of that people think I'm a buddhist and think it's weird. First of all it should'nt be weird to be a Buddhist to start with since it's the most effective thing we have out there. Second of all they should already know these things I'm teaching them.

The reaction should be ""Oh, it's so nice and interesting the things you know about Buddhism"" not ""OMG are you a Buddhist, that's so weird!""",Buddhism,1643726518.0,t3_shwjvt,0.55,3

"Westerners pretending to be Buddhist, does it bother you?","To preface, I‚Äôve learned a long time ago to completely stop talking about Buddhism to many people close to me in my life and even in this forum at times. 

They argue over concepts and dictate what Buddhism is, when they have never read a sutra or stepped foot in a temple with the intention of learning from a teacher. 

On Reddit it is less concerning, just yesterday someone was telling me we have no gods in Buddhism and it is just a philosophy. That‚Äôs easier to ignore, however I feel like what happened to yoga is happening to Buddhism. Some people believe it is just breathing meditation. They proclaim to have vast knowledge of Buddhism and practice when it couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. 

A person close to me went on a visapanna retreat and believed they have been learning Buddhism all along. They don‚Äôt understand simple terms like non-self. They argue when I say it means impermanence. They said no ‚ÄúIt means, don‚Äôt take things personal‚Äù

I guess I‚Äôm happy they are interested but it makes a one way conversation of me listening because they get wildly upset when I explain what something actual is. So I typically change the subject and avoid these topics

I feel bad though for them and myself in a way I maybe shouldn‚Äôt, it seems like someone may be interested in something I am deeply involved. They don‚Äôt understand it at all and are trying to dictate something they have never practiced. I can feel the anger form people when you correct them. 

Is there another way to approach this other than ignoring them or changing the subject?


Edit: Apologies if westerner offended anyone. I am a white westerner. I find our culture on individualism potentially can be a barrier and we typically water down anything to sell for money. It was why I had mentioned yoga.

It's clear that Pure Land teachings focus on getting to a heaven realm via faith in a being (where they then enjoy their time and train to be enlightened).

It seems to me that there is much less emphasis on Gautama and the actual teachings of Gautama.

It's like if I started worshipping the Virgin Mary, said ""her son was pretty cool too I guess"" and called myself a Christian.

(potentially upsetting) How Can Transgender Work with Buddhism?,"I am not transgender, but a close friend is. Here in the United States, Buddhist circles seem pretty passionately pro-transgenderism and non-binary.

I don't intend to sound inflammatory, but am asking from a philosophical/theological perspective: are these not incompatible?

If one of the central tenets of Buddhism is not clinging and cutting through the illusion of the ego, I don't see how transgenderism isn't rejected on a philosophical level, since it is inherently rooted in clinging/aversion to the aggregates. Transgenderism is clinging to an idea (gender, what gender am I) and of course ego (I am the concept, how do others see me, they need to see the concept I want them to see).  It is also aversion to the opposite idea (the gender you don't want to be). Is this not contrary to the Buddha's teachings?

Also, the very claim of transgender is metaphysically dualistic (despite your body, there is a Self that is a certain gender inside).  Is this not contrary to Buddhism?

Again, I am not asking this to be mean-spirited or pull a ""gotcha"",  I just genuinely can't justify the transgenderism from a Buddhist philosophical framework, and so either the entire US community has a blindspot, or more likely, I do and I just can't for the life of me see what I'm missing.  It is difficult because I can't really ""support"" my friend when fundamentally, I view them as confused and ego-clung from the Buddhist framework (we're best friends and nothing changes that, but if they ever try to elicit my support for transgenderism itself, I feel forced to lie and then further confuse them).

Thanks.  


  
EDIT:  Amazing responses so far, I'm grateful for that, as in many communities this topic is tantamount to hate speech and so nothing gets accomplished.  I've definitely gained more compassion for real gender dysphoria (I specify ""real"" only because I do know it can be transitory for some people rather than chronic/immutable) and those who have taken steps to alleviate it. I think fundamentally, my questions don't pertain to real gender dysphoria, because they cropped up around my friend who experiences none at all, which does still strike me as obsession with the aggregates since it's not rooted in the alleviation of psychological suffering but embodying a concept more fully.",Buddhism,1650491134.0,t3_u87drh,0.57,7
The family life is indeed no good for serious practitioners. Consider this a part two to a long lost post.,"In summary of the other post I had mentioned basically that it can be rough if you're a SERIOUS buddhist and have a family. Finding time to meditate, study, etc. I got lashed out at for it of course by the non-buddhists and such that don't understand the whole foundation of buddhism is about escaping rebirth which requires detachment to put it in simple simple english.

Anyhow, that post never said I didn't love them. It effectively said I did love them and that itself was a problem but I did not expect to be fully enlightened this life anyway so I'd go on a family man.

TO NOW:

Things have changed. Communication was never great I've realized. During the first half of our relationship I was a drunk. I guess I was a buddhist too but, I didn't know what buddhism was. I just believed the same. Then googling my beliefs I found Buddhism. Yes of course it had some thoughts I didn't but it was spooky similar like I had studied it prior. Part of why I believe in rebirth. I don't wish to debate it.

That is my fault see. I wasn't a mean drunk fully. Sometimes I was a dick but I quit drinking eventually and we grew really happy even while I was drinking. I mean, she was too and smoking weed and stuff which whatever but my drinking was killing me and interfering with aspects of life so I intended to quit.

Why am I focusing on the drinking? As the years go buy I'm realizing more and more that communication just .. hardly exists ""proper"". It exists but she constantly misunderstands everything, I must repeat things over and over, she argues, etc. See .. this would be great practice for understanding and patience and I've used it as such. The problem arises when I kindly explain what I've said prior and she'll argue until I show her the text or simply walk away if it was said in person. Sometimes I do snap which, I really do not like. Not physically but .. I am human. I yell. ""enough"" basically.

Even that see. There's constant stress from this communication thing.

On top of that ... sex. See for a while she like didn't want to have sex as much for some reason so I'm like whatever. I started the meditations on the body. The intestines and all that fun stuff ya know. Charnel grounds, etc. During the day I got to never wanting sex, even when naked chicks popped on TV. My wife works nights. The only time sex popped in my mind were the nights she had off and I woke up beside her.. right beside her... Anyway.

Suddenly she wanted to go back to normal again. I wasn't the most happy given she knows my practice and that I'd rather ""be all in"" or ""be all out"". In other words, I'd rather be abstinent or just have sex on the regular. I don't want to be TRYING to not have sex but have her springing it on me randomly.

That happened multiple times. There's more but I'm not here for counseling nor to simply complain. Truly.

Now, let me go onto children's behavior, time consumption, etc. I love them. They're great but, good luck with time.

&#x200B;

**Let me say this bluntly: I love my family but if I could do it again knowing what was in my mind and heart was Buddhism, I would not have. I do not regret this and will not leave them but if you're seriously considering buddhism then seriously consider the sex you're having. EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT AIMING TO BE A MONK. You may find you wish to practice more seriously than you intended. You can always get laid/married later if you change your mind.**

EDIT for the non-practioners: Why are these problems? Because they're obviously constant distractions and stress. Like I said, ""serious"". Please don't comment your OPINIONS on family arrangements as typically seen without buddhism and such.

Setting Christianity Aside,"I think I can prove to myself whether or not Christianity, or Catholicism in particular, is false. And that‚Äôs by transforming myself through sheer willpower. That‚Äôs because the teaching of my current faith is that you can‚Äôt be freed from sin but by the grace of God. This is a dogmatic teaching, so if it‚Äôs shown to be false by proven experience, then it‚Äôs as though the whole edifice of Catholicism crumbles. Because a dogma is a truth fallen from heaven, the Church is supposed to be protected from binding the faithful to heresy.

Reality honestly seems to suggest to me however, so far, from my immersion into different religions and philosophies, that ascetic practices in general, in and of themselves, are capable of healing sin and freeing one from suffering. Practices such as devotion, meditation, introspection, thought control, contemplation and more. And, of course, worldviews also have an impact on how one lives and responds to things as well.

As the title suggests, I‚Äôm not quite giving up on Christianity. There‚Äôs intellectual problems I still have to face if I‚Äôm to abandon it entirely. I‚Äôm just going to put it off if you will to see whether or not Buddhist teachings and practice can result in a significant self-transformation. Indeed, I think I‚Äôll strive to keep particularly Christian morals as a point to prove to myself whether or not it‚Äôs false, such as no sexual activity outside of marriage.

I struggle with mental illness and addiction, and have sort of relied on this powerful religious experience I went through several years ago to maintain my faith. I was practicing hesychasm in a way, or rather, the Jesus Prayer, for a couple of weeks, all day at work. O Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner. But I wouldn‚Äôt pray at all if I had fallen to one of my addictions that day. I was smoking synthetic marijuana, and one night I was contemplating suicide by heroin, when I prayed the prayer for the first time a day I had fed my addictions. Well, it was a clear night, and I swear I heard thunder, felt my bosom become energized, and it was like I was compelled to pray the prayer until I was sober.

It was as though God proved his existence to me that night. I just sort of ignored the major delusional episode that happened shortly after. And just always assumed that this experience was legitimate. But after having had my third major delusional episode, the experience has lost its impact.

To learn the teachings of the Buddha, I am turning to the two most popular teachers in the West, Thich Nhat Hahn, and the Dalai Lama. I‚Äôm ordering their books on Amazon tonight, The Heart of the Buddha‚Äôs Teaching, and One Teacher, Many Traditions. I‚Äôm also ordering a zafu/zabuton meditation set, and some mala beads. Mantra meditation with beads seems very similar to the hesychasm I have been practicing.

"Beware anyone who refuses to talk openly or honestly about even the lowest levels of attainment. There are 10 fetters, someone who cannot even admit their own state as to the first 3 should raise giant red flags. The Buddha was open and honest about sharing the secrets of the Dhamma with others.",">  A sotƒÅpanna is a person who has seen the dharma and consequently, has dropped the first three fetters (sa≈ãyojana), namely:  
1. Self-view (sakkƒÅya-ditthi)   
2. Clinging to rites and rituals (sƒ´labbata-parƒÅmƒÅsa)  
3. Skeptical indecision (vicikitsa)  

>  The first moment of the attainment is termed the path of stream-entry (sotƒÅpatti-magga), which cuts through the first three fetters.  The person who experiences it is called a stream-winner (sotƒÅpanna).

>  The sotƒÅpanna is said to attain an intuitive grasp of the dharma, this wisdom being called right view (sammƒÅ di·π≠·π≠hi) and has unshakable confidence in the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha. 

There are many valid reasons to refrain from claiming the higher states of attainment such as being a once-returner, non-returner, or an arahant.

There is NO valid reason to brag or expect praise after achieving the lowest level of attainment, stream entry.  Anyone who is lying about attainment to themselves or others would clearly lie about grander things than the first 3 fetters.

Any ‚ÄúGuru‚Äù who refuses to talk about even the lowest level of attainment, refuses to give any clues or help to a student trying to achieve stream entry, is obsessed with aggressively attacking other stream winners ‚Äî such a person should be viewed with extreme caution and any advice they give should be taken with extreme skepticism.  Any Guru who only quotes the Dharma but never explains anything in their own words and always changes the subject away from stream entry.  All signs point to such a person as masquerading as a Fake Guru. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

Stream entry is overcoming:

1. Self-view 
2. Clinging to rituals and practices 
3. Skeptical doubt 

If you only look inward, only trying to see your true mind there is no ritual.  If you see your true mind, essentially the pure imagination of birth, which has created a complex and imaginary sense of self and all the fetters over a lifetime of sensory input, this is seeing through self view.  If you really believe this is ‚Äúit‚Äù and there‚Äôs no deeper secret you‚Äôve overcome skeptical doubt and are ready for stream entry.  It has to be an insight you feel in your bones, not simple words.  There is no rule on how long it will take for your mind to be ripe to attain steam entry, or how it will finally occur. 

Anyone who refuses to talk openly and honestly about even the very first step of their attainment should be seen as a potentially Fake Guru with questionable motives or incomplete knowledge of the Dhamma. 

The Buddha talked openly and frankly to anyone and everyone about all of the states of attainment, clues and practices to get there, and gave descriptions of his inner state almost to nauseating length in order to help others achieve the same result. 

You do not have to be a perfect saint (arahant) to become a stream winner.  Buddhism is the path to enter sainthood, sainthood is not the requirement to enter Buddhism. 

The Buddha helped an untold amount of ordinary people become stream winners and he was never obscuring anything.  If anyone is seeking to obscure or hide anything about even the lowest levels of attainment it should be viewed as a giant red flag. 

You should not spend your whole life in suffering, it is worth the effort to try to become a stream winner.  It is possible and anyone can achieve it with sincere effort and practice.

I feel as though there is a dearth of literature/discussion specifically around the intersection between Buddhism and feminism. Does anyone feel similarly?,"I am 23 years old and consider myself to be a passionate and dedicated feminist. For the past few years, I have undergone a sort of ""feminist awakening"" and have been reading, writing and talking about feminist issues with others. For approximately the same amount of time, I have been reading some Buddhist literature, and slowly absorbing and embracing the ideas. It has been a struggle to completely implement Buddhist teachings into my everyday life, but I know that is a universal struggle among practicing Buddhists. 

One big problem I have run into is how to seamlessly integrate feminism and Buddhism into each other. I almost never come across the topic of feminism in readings, podcasts, or posts in related subreddits such as /r/ZenHabits. This is distressing, because I firmly believe that feminism at its core is a ""wise and loving politics"" (to quote the great Bell Hooks, a wonderful feminist author. The entire quote is right [here](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/295265-visionary-feminism-is-a-wise-and-loving-politics-it-is) for anyone interested). 

One difficulty in particular that I regularly encounter is the ability to curtail my own reactivity when faced with street harassment or other forms of public sexual violence. As the great Eckhart Tolle (the writer I have read the most of) says, reactivity is just another way for our egos to feed themselves. Yet, when I experience or read or hear misogyny out in the world, it is very difficult to not be affected by it. And I'm not sure it is *right* to strive to remain unaffected by it, because I believe taking a silent and passive approach is not helpful for change, and calling people out on hateful speech is important.

I know that people who are particularly chauvinistic are generally deeply unconscious people and are also likely to be racist, classist, materialistic, etc. However, I am friends with certain men who I know read/study/attempt to internalize Buddhist literature, and cannot understand the sexism that women regularly face that make it difficult to remain as calm, nonreactive and stable as the Buddha. In many cases, it is simply very unsafe for one to not react to forms of sexual violence, and it is extremely offensive to tell female victims of rape/assault to ""just forgive"" their aggressors in the wake of deep trauma.

I just googled ""Buddhism and feminism"" and came across [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Buddhism-After-Patriarchy-Feminist-Reconstruction/dp/0791414043), which looks like a great read. Before reading it though, I would really like to read any thoughts on this issue from this subreddit. My guess is that not many readers here are female (simply because of the Redditor demographic) but it's a start. Any females who can offer their ideas for integrating Buddhism and feminism/feminist activism, I would be so thrilled to read what you have to say.

Fatal Flaw in Buddhism,"I adhere to most tenets of Buddhism, however, I think I have encountered a fatal flaw in any Indic (or otherwise) religions espousing rebirth. I hope that someone can counteract this with something reasonable. 

My thinking follows in this manner. A central tenet of Mahayana Buddhism is that rebirth in the human realm is of greatest import because it allows one to follow the path of Dharma. However, due to the Sun's life-cycle [four billion years from now, the increase in the Earth's surface temperature will cause a runaway greenhouse effect, heating the surface enough to melt it. By that point, all life on the Earth will be extinct.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_of_the_Earth) Due to this, it stands to reason that there will no longer be any human realm to be reborn into, at which point all chances for Buddhahood will be lost. 

I'm not trying to cause a rift in the sangha, just hoping someone will rebut this so I can stop entertaining such a troubling thought. ",Buddhism,1466530673.0,t3_4p5uwv,0.54,2

r/Buddhism it ok if I add a strictly small non-intrusive non-abusive footer with a way to accept donations in my posts?,"Hello reddit,
I'm Shi Shan Yu, born name Antonio. Since it's a sensitive subject I beg you to read it throughly before voting.

First let me make clear that earning **anything** at all is not of my interest when posting. I like to post here and comment and give advice in anything I can just because I like it. I do it because I want to do it and for the benefit of anyone reading it. I don't know if some of my posts are very good or bad or neutral, but I try to put my best effort in them whenever I write them. I'm very glad when people find it useful (and that's all the motivation I need) and I always try to think out how to make my topics more interesting, more useful or more understandable to all the people here. 

Right now our [school](http://xueyuan.com.mx) is going thru a tough situation economically. We are working very hard to solve this problem, we are not lying in our back at all, but if anyone is in a position of helping (and I understand that not many of us are), we would welcome any help and thank you very deeply.

Any donation no matter how small would help us greatly. Our institute is devoted to teaching Ch√°n Buddhism and Shaolin customs (incluiding kung fu) and we have done it for free for 2 years now, since all the money we get has gone to pay rent, water or improving the school so that people can train or practice in a better place.

I'd like to make clear that if you agree I will keep posting the same posts as usual and if you don't agree I will keep posting the same posts as usual. Again, I post here because I like to and because I want to, not because I want to ask you for money.

So I'd like to hear your opinion and thoughts. Please give it a chance. I'm not asking you for money, I'm asking you to let me add a non intrusive or abusive way so that people that want to help us can send us their donations.

Anyway thanks for your time reading this.

The footer would be like this (and would only be added in self posts like this):

"ü§î Wouldn't it be great if there was a Discord community for Buddhism?

It'd be a place without bigotry or sectarianism...WAIT! There is one!ü§ù","# üôè -- GOLDEN SWASTIKA -- üôè

\-----

‚ò∏Ô∏è **What is it**

It is a *Buddhist Community* on **Discord** that has proven itself to be a productive social networking, learning, and educational safe-space for Buddhists **(13+)** from all around the world. It is a multi-tradition server that has helped hundreds of Buddhists to meet new Buddhists (Lay and Clergy), make friends, and be able to discuss the Dharma not with strangers like in other forums but with people you got to know over time. It is where we can make online Buddhist friends, and talk with them about whatever we want from a Buddhist perspective; From politics to Buddhist cultures, from gaming to Buddhist cuisine. *(Full list of features below)*

It's a community built around the pillars of anti-colonialism, where we can freely discuss the marginalisation of Buddhism and Asian Buddhists. Although optional for many members, this has been one of our defining pillars. anti-colonial, criticising harmful movements\*

**No matter what kind of a Buddhist you are, Golden Swastika is for you.** If you are either a new Buddhist who wants to ask questions, a Buddhist who wants to make more lay friends, a Buddhist looking for a space that gives freedom to be critical of movements harmful against Buddhism, or even a non-Buddhist wanting to learn more about Buddhism by talking to people who have lived decades within its culture and teachings, **this is the place for you!**

So, here is what we have to offer!

# ‚öôÔ∏è Our Features

‚öôÔ∏èüåê **Socialise and Network:**

Meet Buddhists of all sorts of traditions from many different countries, ranging from lay to clergy, inexperienced to experienced and converts to born-Buddhists. It is important to socialise with and have trustworthy, kind, knowledgeable friends in your journey as a Buddhist. This server offers the chance to accomplish those two things!

**‚öôÔ∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà LGBTQ+ Friendly:**

Golden Swastika has always been a safe-space for LGBTQ people. Inspired by the dharma, we do not allow any sort of Homophobia or Transphobia on our server. Every kind of person is welcome in this community. We cannot ask you to always understand each other, or see eye to eye on social issues, but we can all be respectful and kind to each other. And that's what we have been very successful at so far!

‚öôÔ∏èüßí **Curated Experience for Teens:**

We both want to allow buddhists of all kinds in our server, but also be able to discuss more mature and darker subjects surrounding the Dharma or our lives as Buddhists. To do this, the Server features a curated experience for people who pick up the 13-18 age role where they will have limited access to certain channels, and have access to channels others don't.

‚öôÔ∏èüîß **Professional Management**:

We offer a top-notch professional and diverse crew in our management team, including people who have had experience in moderating servers with more than a thousand people, and people who have worked in the software development industry. The management works via a council that discusses and votes on server issues. Our team is made up of people from very diverse backgrounds: Theravada to Mahayana, Young and Old, born-buddhists and converts, queer people, Lay people to Ministers.

‚öôÔ∏è‚úã**Transparency:**

Unlike many other online spaces, Golden Swastika prides itself on its distribution of power and transparency when it comes to moderation and administration. It is run by a transparent democratic council, instead of a single individual. All suggestions are taken very seriously, and server-criticism is welcomed.

‚öôÔ∏èüé≠ **Expressive Channels**:

The Community features many expressive (yet optional) channels that are not necessarily purely dharma oriented: Leisure channels to socialise over lay-life, channels to play games via Bots, or more serious channels where we discuss Cults or Politics. However you would like to express yourself to your Buddhist friends, it is possible here!

**‚öôÔ∏èüìà Leveling:**

We feature a new-user-friendly leveling system that aims to ease new user's access to more advanced and optional channels to prevent channel-creep.

**‚öôÔ∏èüñåÔ∏èAesthetically pleasing server design.**

**‚öôÔ∏èüìø Regular Group Prayers hosted by experienced Buddhists**

**‚öôÔ∏è**üõ°Ô∏è **Top Notch anti-raid protection that has been proven to work.**

**‚öôÔ∏èüìö Channels made for the purpose of Learning and Education.**

&#x200B;

# üå± If you are new to Buddhism

&#x200B;

# ‚õî What we don't have, and do not allow

‚õî **No Bigotry:** Racism, Xenophobia, Queerphobia, Sexism, Toxic behavior, Pro-Colonialism and other forms of Bigotry is absolutely unwelcome in this community.

**‚õîNo Misrepresented Buddhism:** This space is highly and vocally critical of the Cultural appropriation of Buddhism. Therefore no Secular ""Buddhism"", no new age practitioners looking to steal buddhist practices, no cult members, and so on.

‚õî**No Sectarianism:** Our server opposes any kind of sectarianism. Individual expression and justification for preferring / not preferring a teaching / school is totally understandable, but any sort of public disparagement of any valid school of Buddhism is completely against what we stand for. All schools of Buddhism ranging from esoteric theravada to nichiren, from tendai to nyingma are all protected.

\--------------------

We need strong friendships in our Buddhist path. What are you waiting for?

"Dharma Master Hengyun answers questions about abortion (2/3): ""What about sexual assault?""","**Question: If a girl were raped and got pregnant, is abortion allowed in such a case?**

 Answer: This kind of situation really deserves our sympathy. However, if the girl aborts the fetus, she would be killing a life. Therefore, even in these unfortunate circumstances, she still should give birth to the child. Although the girl may encounter a lot of hardship by doing so, from the perspective of causes and effects, having the baby is a better alternative than killing.

...

Let‚Äôs think about it, after children are born, their parents treat them as precious treasuries and take care of them with the upmost attention to detail. However, the fetus in one‚Äôs womb is also one‚Äôs own child; how can one bear to kill him or her? If your abort a child, even if the child originally has positive affinities with you, such affinities would become negative like that of an enemy. The aborted fetus turns into ‚Äúa little ghost who is difficult to handle.‚Äù

The Shurangama Sutra pointed out that, ‚ÄúOne should realize that debts should be settled, whether with money, goods, or labor, so that indebtedness can naturally come to an end. But if, in the process of repayment, beings take each other‚Äôs lives or eat each other‚Äôs flesh, then they may well continue through an infinite number of eons, eating each other and killing each other, as if they were turning ceaselessly on a wheel, now on top, now beneath. The wheel may never stop unless they undertake the practice of samatha, or unless a Buddha appears in the world.‚Äù

...

During the process of mutual resentment, if one living being kills another or eats another‚Äôs flesh, then a cycle of eating and being eaten, killing and being killed will go on and on like the turning of a wheel. For example, you eat my flesh now, I will kill you later; I eat your flesh now, you will kill me later. This vicious cycle is endless, unless one attains the Shurangama Samadhi or a Buddha comes into the world and releases one from these karmic offenses. Only then would both the debtor and the creditor understand the need to stop creating further negative karma, and end this cycle of ceaseless mutual-indebtedness. Otherwise, it is very difficult to appease animosity that is as great as the sea. It is not surprising that the Venerable Master said: ‚ÄúI urge everyone not to have abortions any more. Think about it, if living beings become resentful spirits even before they are born, with these vengeful little ghosts of aborted fetuses everywhere, how can the society be peaceful? These little ghosts can only be crossed over by genuine cultivators of the Bodhi Path who are not greedy for wealth. These little ghosts are really tough to handle! It is very difficult to resolve these matters, and thus, with karmic offenses pervading everywhere, how can there be peace?‚Äù

What is Zen?,"**According to the late Joseph Campbell**: 

>This word *zen* is the Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese word *ch'an*, and the Chinese word is a mispronunciation of the Sanskrit word *dhyana*, which means ""contemplation."" Contemplation normally is thought of as disciplined meditation. I have spoken about the *ku·πá·∏çalinƒ´* yoga, a form of psychological and spiritual discipline that consists of bringing a serpent of energy up through the spine. In Zen, you seek to transform your mode of experience through just this kind of spiritual exercise so that you actually come to the illumination that the Buddha came to in the way the Buddha himself did, not just seated in a shrine being a little dragon mouth saying ""Buddha, Buddha, Buddha,"" then expecting to get somewhere. Here you are going to go to *work*.

**The Zen or Chan School**

Originally, the Sanskrit term ""dhyƒÅna"" was rendered into Chinese using the following characters, Á¶™ÈÇ£ (chan na). This is an approximation of saying the Sanskrit word, dhyƒÅna. Later the ""na"" was dropped which then became Chan (Á¶™) and in Japanese Zen.   

The formal idea of a Zen or Chan School/chan zong came much later. It was first conceived of by Chanshi Zongmi (780‚Äì841) as an extended clan of ten lineages one of which was Tiantai. The idea of a Chan School was not adopted until the ninth century; nor did it gain much attention until the Song. At no time was there ever an institutionally separate Chan School apart from Buddhism. Another name for the Chan School is the *Buddha Mind School* (‰ΩõÂøÉÂÆó). 

Looking at the word, Chan School/Chan zong, we should be kept in mind that it is not a sect (= dissenting religious body). Zong is the Chinese rendering of Sanskrit, *siddhƒÅnta* which pertains to realization. Translating zong by either ""school"" or ""lineage"", proves to be an inadequate translation which doesn't reflect the full meaning of *siddhƒÅnta*. We might even think of the Chan School as meaning the Chan or Zen realization. 

The core principle of the Chan School is, *illumination of Mind; seeing one's true nature* (ÊòéÂøÉË¶ãÊÄß).  The core practice is ""gongfu"" (ÂäüÂ§´) defined as *inner practice and cultivation of mind*.  A word about seated meditation, it is practiced in virtually all schools of Buddhism. It is part of gongfu. It is certainly not unique to the Chan School.

I'll stay open minded but here's my current problem with Tibetan Buddhism and the Dalai Lama,"First of all, I think Dalai Lama is a great person, he seems very compassionate and obviously very knowledgeable in Buddhism. I'm not sure if he is a great monk however.  

 I can't help but feels like as a monk he shouldn't involve in human politics or be celebrated as an idol to the extent that he is allowing himself to. 

Furthermore, he wears a rolex and I heard he has a collection of rolex watches, does it not go against the code of living simple and austere life as Buddha himself taught?

Now my criticism towards Tibetan Buddhism. Diety worshipping, blessings, rituals and other form of superstitions are openly encouraged in their practice. This is obviously in conflict with the essence of four noble truth or the eightfold path, which suggest that only you can attain enlightenment for yourself and that the practice, discipline everything has to be pretty much self reliant and autonomous. You cannot bless another person into great wealth, good health or into Nirvana. So what are they doing?

A Meditation for Michael Dorfman,"Michael Dorfman and hyun_a left /r/Buddhism a treasure a little over a month ago:

hyun_a:
> why is pursuing nirvana, specifically, preferable to leading a good life?

Michael Dorfman:
> Because of the First Noble Truth.
> Even a rebirth in the Tushita heaven involves suffering amidst the joy, and nirvana is the cessation of all suffering (hence superior.)

hyun_a:
> I am not sure what is so attractive about Tushita to begin with. I am talking about a moral life that would lead to enjoyment of travel, art, social interactions, culture, intellectual development, physical challenges, exploring of nature, space and mysteries of existence. And these would be enjoyed life, after life, after life, if one strives in all lives to be moral, to the best of their ability. So, with favorable conditions and minimal suffering, why is nirvana preferable to all these?
> What does nirvana provide one, to begin with, that would override pleasurable experiences, whether of the body, heart or of the mind? Is it a continuous state of peace/tranquility/bliss, that lacks suffering? I am trying to establish some points of reference that would motivate one to choose pursuing nirvana over pursuing a moral life that minimizes suffering and maximizes good living conditions in the present and future.

---

I encourage everyone to meditate on this. It is a *very* good question. User vgtaluskie continued the original thread (which is below Michael Dorfman's last comment) but I think the question deserves another go-around.

EDIT: About 30 seconds after I posted this, I recalled that this is essentially the plot of the excellent movie Star Trek: Generations, which features a ""nexus"" that can provide such experiences. So for those who have seen the movie and who know what I'm talking about (or you can just read about it here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_Generations) the question can be rephrased as, **if I had access to the nexus, why would I want nirvana?**",Buddhism,1392970354.0,t3_1yirpf,0.56,3
Buddhism and atheism are completely compatible.,"Wahola Rapula, a Buddhist scholar and author of ""What the Buddha taught"" says, and I do not quote, that Buddhism is neither a religion or a philosophy. Celebrating holidays or performing rituals is not necessary to being a Buddhist, and Buddhist holidays and rituals exist to satisfy certain human needs of the many who are seeking Nirvana, or the cessation of dukkha.

The only thing Buddhism requires, (I'm still semi-quoting here) is that one follow the eight fold path set out by the Buddha.

End quote.

This is in the theraveda tradition of course. Also one might consider the five precepts of: no harming life, no adultery, no lying, no theft, and (no intoxicating drink, I think) as necessary to being a Buddhist.

I think personally that following the 8fold path is a sure fire way to be more happy whether you want to call yourself a Buddhist or not.",Buddhism,1388986789.0,t3_1uip5y,0.53,1

need help to write a sci-fi buddhist exorcist team and also weapons as a writer and learning more about buddhism culture for a story,"Hello I am working on a sci-fi fantasy story and I am writing a space organization that fights demons from space, the organization uses religious exorcism inspired weapons to fight demons. I am writing two teams so far which are the Christian exorcism team and the buddhist exorcism team. The christian exorcism team uses solid electricity weapons that is blessed by priests so that the weapons can have a holy water affect to the demons when they get hit.

And for the buddhist exorcism team, I am having trouble writing their weapons without trying to be offensive. I am aware that in buddhism, they dont believe in demons instead they believe the evil energy curropting the person and they use rituals to remove that evil from the person (correct me if Im wrong, sorry).

Critical Buddhism,"For me the main issue where I am questioning to which extent to embrace Buddhism, or want to engage more, is in how far Buddhism is willing to question itself? From my experience the answer is often a very firm no, but sometimes I wonder if that represents mainstream voices that drawn out the more discerning ones.

The obvious one is questioning statements or views of authoritative voices within Buddhism (particularly the Buddha). Scientifically when a being exist in a pre-rational, pre-scientific culture the chances they say little or nothing questionable seem very low indeed.

From a mythical perspective one would be inclined to find a ""true"" interpretation instead, but I think that is not a practical view to hold on to.

In general this issue seems to be more or less taboo, so an approach of reverential reception / belief is taken with regards to ancient text?

I would be glad to your input on this, especially concerning specific movements, groups or individual that take a skeptical and discerning view on Buddhist thought and practice, preferably without creating a mere secularized or modern-pragmatic approach which in my view sacrifices some important aspects.",Buddhism,1656754852.0,t3_vpo4ga,0.56,2

Do we believe in ‚Äúreality shifting‚Äù,Okay so basically some people asked this question on Reddit but they ask as if they want to go to Harry Potter. But I‚Äôm going to try to explain it. They are asking if reality shifting exists with 2 different ways. Way 1 is the shifting of your personal perception. So like full on experiencing there is not self to truly believe it. Way 2 is seeing something. Aka ‚ÄúI tried shifting and shifted to a random land and a random silhouette told me I wasn‚Äôt ready‚Äù type of thing. I‚Äôve seen experiences and also people shifting to meet someone. On tiktok people want to meet draco but a lot of Buddhists specifically pure landers want to see/meet Amitabha Buddha. Definitely people have exploited it into something only to get married there but the people on the sub Reddit probably aren‚Äôt asking that. This comes from a state of deep meditation and one of the main people who promoted it was someone who was inspired by both Hinduism and Buddhism and actually called reality shifting subconscious lifting saying that shifting is ‚Äúsubconscious realization‚Äù understanding there is no self and that there are ways to get out of our main view aka seeing the sky the rocks beginning of space etc. some believe in different universes or a place where they chose a different choice than they actually chose and they see the chain of events that happened because of that.

Rejection of rebirth by Buddhadasa,"Buddhadasa rejected the notion of rebirth and karma doctrine since it is incompatible with sunyata.

To him, what is rebirth is not the self, as self cannot be found even right now (sunyata).

But what is rebirth is the notion of I, the notion of self.

As what is rebirth is actually a notion, an ignorance, this doesn't fit to be called rebirth.

Because rebirth is understood to be a birth of self, instead of the birth of ignorance.

The concept of rebirth just doesn't match in case of ignorance.

This is true, isn't it?

If we see Buddhist Patticasammupadda, did Buddha ever mention it is self that rebirth? Never. You cannot find such thing whether in Pali or Mahayana.

What Buddha explain is the cause of rebirth, which is ignorance. The rebirth is the sense of I, not the actual self. 

Just like we see a mirage and the delusion of water appears. That delusion of water is the rebirth. That stupidity, that ignorance of that is water is the one that reappears again, again and again.

The whole process of rebirth doesn't involve any self or any atman or any soul. How can we then say there is rebirth? 

Rebirth of soul? Rebirth of Atman? Rebirth of self?

Rebirth is a language of atman, we can't use it for anatman. It is just not compatible.",Buddhism,1617083477.0,t3_mg9450,0.5,0

Jesus as a Bodhisattva,"He expressed so much compassion, and contrary to what modern churches teach, he was teaching self knowledge and that we are All children of God. Not just Him, all of us have his potential, the meaning just got garbled by councils of theologians controlled by politicians.
This sounds a LOT like Buddha Nature to me. Don't see it?  Check out esoteric chrisiantys view on Who Jesus is, and who we can become.
Given that the God of mystical Jew's(ain soph) has been compared often to the dharmakaya,
It could be said that Jesus' references to God are not Wrong View, just skillful means when talking to the patriarchal lineage focused Hebrews at that time. 

From this perspective, it seems obvious to me, that Jesus was an emanation of Avalokiteshvara. If one accepts that, then they can be a Buddhist christian imo. Mixing Jesus' teachings with Mahayana seems skillful for helping heap places like America.

"Trouble finding Buddhist materials that aren't lumped in with ""woo"".","There are a lot of folks who include Buddhism as part of a mishmash of spiritual philosophies, and due to this, it can be hard to find music, books, and other stuff that is strictly Buddhist and isn't just general ""New Age"".

I used to be into all of that stuff many years ago, but went completely atheist and abadoned everything. Now, I'm getting into mindfulness and am focused on dealing with the causes of my own suffering but have zero interest in going back to all the extraneous stuff like tarot, crystals, etc. 

Anyone else in a similar position, and how are you going about it?

"Buddhism and connections to Spirituality (Pineal Gland, Astral Projection, etc)","So I was wondering what the Buddhist take on spiritual things such as the Pineal Gland (Third eye), and Astral Projections is. I seem to have this really unhealthy sort of obsession with these kind of things, but I have recently got really invested in wanting to learn about Buddhism, and I have decided to go out my way to practice as soon as I can.   

I truly believe in a lot of these things, and I often watch people on YouTube who touch on these subjects, such as Koi Fresco, and someone else I actually just discovered tonight called Ryan Cropper.  

Both of these guys seem to be into Buddhism themselves, and even have videos on the eightfold path and stuff like that.  

What is everyone's take on all this, do you believe in both Buddhist teachings and spirituality, or are you a true believe of just one? I suspect that believing in spiritual stuff would more be a mahayana buddhist thing, but I believe that anyone can count themselves as a buddhist and believe in literally anything they want. I say you can be a Buddhist yet still believe in a god (Not that I do).

I had a dream that I ate a magic bean that allowed me to meet God,"I dreamt I was walking through a supermarket when I noticed they were selling magic mushrooms. Entranced, I was curious about the similar products I might find in the same section. I noticed a variety of flavors of magic beans, all promising different virtues. The magic bean that really grabbed my attention was marketed to give me the clairvoyant power of knowing God's current location. I figured it was a good buy, so I grabbed a bag and went to the quick checkout line.

After I had made my purchase, I swallowed down a handful of these magic beans. The knowledge of God's location crept into my brain slowly, like the process of coming to understand an idea, until I had that, ""Oh! Of course!"" moment.

Once it had seeped through and became obvious, I was led by my curiosity to where God happened to be at the time, which of course wasn't far. He was halfway up a nearby tree -- the same kind I used to climb when I was a child. I approached the tree and could see only his legs hanging from the branches above me.

I was very familiar with climbing these kinds of trees from my childhood, so I climbed up to see him. I was met with the most ordinary face I've ever seen. He wasn't what you would expect God to look like. Just an average, middle aged man with a greying goatee. If it weren't for the magic bean I would have thought this was just an ordinary man. I remember thinking, ""He's just so... ordinary."" His closest resemblance is, strangely, [Tim Curry](http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MTQ2OTYwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzEzMTA1._V1_SX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg).

After a very short moment of looking at each other, as if reading my thoughts he responded (as politely as possible) ""Well I don't find you particularly interesting either."" And with a goofy grin, he flew off like a startled bird. 

As it turns out, it wasn't that big of a deal. He was just the epitome of mediocrity. And therein I learned the value of mediocrity.

A bee pooped here.,"This is a quote from the book called [Trespassing on Einstein's Lawn](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17834895-trespassing-on-einstein-s-lawn): 
> My father had once told me that when he was a teenager on summer vacation, he was lying on a hammock in the backyard of his family home, not two miles from the home in which he and my mother would later raise me, reading The Way of Zen. ‚ÄúThe book was talking about the illusion of the ego,‚Äù my father had told me, ‚Äúand the duality of subject and object. I was totally blown away by this idea, which was so simple and yet so profound. It had such an effect on me that I became hyperaware of everything around me. I was so in the moment. And then a bee landed on the page and pooped on it and then flew away. So I circled the stain on the page and wrote in the margin, ‚ÄòA bee pooped here.‚Äô¬†‚Äù When he told me that story, I found myself wondering what I would have done if a bee had shat on my teenage reading, which was pretty much the opposite of everything Zen. Most likely I would have circled the stain in my Sartre and written, ‚ÄúFigures.‚Äù But the funny thing is, unbeknownst to my father, when I had snuck out of this house to get my first tattoo at the age of fourteen, I had, amidst my existentialism and angst, gotten a tattoo of the Chinese character for Zen, which looked like a little Hawaiian man carrying a tiki torch on my hip, because even though I was rebelling, I really just wanted to be like my father, to have the kind of subterranean wisdom I saw lurking behind his eyes, which were large and brown and sloped downward at the edges so that he appeared perpetually sleepy or stoned, eyes I had inherited from him and regarded not as mere genetic facsimile but as a secret handshake.

I avoid downvoting and only do so when someone writes something which is solely offensive to others: ""you self-righteous asshole"" or something similar. Otherwise, I'd prefer to engage people in discussion - the idea being that through discussion, I either consolidate what I believe or I find myself questioning myself anew. This is what I came to reddit to do.

I've asked myself how much of this new thread is just ego reacting to being criticised. There is some of that, I am sure. But there is also a feeling that we do ourselves a disservice by voting down content that we disagree with. There is also a doubt that this is compatible with the buddhism that so many here claim to practise. There is also a sense that we can only benefit from talking to each other rather than lazily clicking a blue flower. 

Am I alone in thinking this?

After doing semen retention for 7 days I must say that you may as well make it a precept to refrain from porn and masturbation.,"Hello,

As Buddhists if we are to say that taking intoxicants is going against one of the 5 precepts, then we should include porn. I know the damage done by drugs/alcohol on our awareness and meditative efforts. However, a life without porn and masturbation is so beneficial to meditation that I almost feel it should be a precept. 

It‚Äôs a little bonkers how much porn and masturbation effects ones meditation and general well being in life. I agree you can make meditative progress while masturbating to pork but same could be said with drinking a few drinks in the evening. 

I‚Äôm just saying if you‚Äôre a serious practitioner of Buddhism hisim meditation and see the benefit of not drinking alcohol/drugs, then refrain from porn and masturbation to its just as damaging to ones progress. 

Not sleeping on comfortable beds, fasting on one meal a day, music, movies don‚Äôt even touch the benefit of refraining from porn and masturbation.

A lot of denialism about this cause of our sexual liberal society. Its also a vice we are most attached too and people get butt hurt hearing this.

If you feel stuck in your spiritual life/meditation give semen retention a shot. And buddhists should promote this more.",Buddhism,1701276447.0,t3_186txmx,0.38,0
"If Buddhists consider plants to be living creatures, then why can they eat them?","I thought Buddhists were vegetarian because of the precept ""Don't take life."" But plants are as alive as animals. Why doesn't vegetarianism violate the precept?

EDIT: thank you everyone for the healthy debate. I did not come here to insult your beliefs, but rather to gain a deeper understanding so that I may come to terms with my own perspective on life, and include or exclude what I must in order to live like a Buddha. It sounds like some Buddhists eat meat, and others do not. I can't really see anything wrong with either decision, so long as the former opts out of killing the animal itself, or ordering it to be killed for them. The main point here is compassion, which so many of you have emphasized. However, it is true that the Dali Lama eats meat, and if anyone has enlightenment, it's him. I am more of a zen Buddhist, although I don't like to associate with any particular religion or sect because it only enhances the ego. You've all given me a lot to think about, and I appreciate the responses. Thank you, and have a happy holiday season!

Edit 2: I thought this discussion was done, but I'm still getting responses in my mailbox. I believe that my question is philosophical in nature, and revolves around the definition of the word ""pain."" There is scientific evidence that plants do respond negatively to pain, but because they have no nervous system they do not feel it in the same way that we do. That being said, we can never truly know if they ""feel"" anything. My bottom line is this: the philosopher Alan Watts once asked an enlightened friend of his that if he knew plants suffer, why does he even eat plants? The friend replied, ""I know they suffer, but they don't scream as loud.""",Buddhism,1387805453.0,t3_1tj178,0.55,4

Buddhist Christians Cannot Exist,"I don't know why this concept is such a thing (I have suspicions). 

Jesus of Nazareth said: ""I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me"". This is not ambiguous. If you believe in him ( are a christian) then you already have the complete path to truth in Jesus. Why would you feel the need to supplement or improve God's teachings with those of a random non-christian monk? (whose teachings are often directly contradictory to those of the church!) 

On the other hand, if you do not believe what he said, and think he was a normal guy (or secret arahant) who still claimed to be the Son of God, then you must believe that he was either a great fool or a great liar. In either case, why would you want to associate with him at all?

To the argument that ""Buddhism is more of a philosophy than a religion"" and so can coexist with theist religion: If a philosophy disagrees with nothing, it is not saying anything. And what does Buddhism say, after you remove every single spiritual or religious idea? ""Don't be greedy""? ""Be mindful""? Christianity and even human common sense already that that much covered. To be clear, I am not saying Buddhism or its followers are devoid of content, only that some people act like it is.

I can think of two reasons one might be drawn to the idea of being a ""Buddhist christian"". More cynically, that they are not very knowable about the doctrine of either faith, and are not interested in devout practice of anything, but still have a need to be ""spiritual"" . Like say someone who was raised Catholic, but is bored of going to the same church every week, so they spice up their weekend by going to a Buddhist temple instead; taste some exotic orientalism.

More generously, maybe people claim to be multiple religions to promote tolerance between cultures. A noble goal, but the language of Buddhist Christianity subtlety damages the Church. All peoples are equal, but truths are not.  It would be better to completely abandon God and switch to Buddhism than to stay a christian in name only.

This is disappointing,"**If you are going to read this, please read it completely before voting.**

r/Buddhism, I've been disappointed by you.

You have turned r/Buddhism into a narrow and obstructed view of Buddhism, thus, no buddhism at all. This forum is both attached to death talk, to problem talks, to motivational talks and to pseudo-intelectual talks, among others... Some of these things are in nature good but, the way you are using them is going to get old soon enough in your life and in this forum.

Again, [All wisdom in all buddhism is one, universal and true, always](http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/kuclo/all_wisdom_in_all_buddhism_is_one_universal_and/) and [Buddhism doesn't tell you what you want to hear, Buddhism tells you what it is](http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/kte88/buddhism_doesnt_tell_you_what_you_want_to_hear/).

Those of you who tell me that I have no authority and that have much complains about me, first of all let me tell you that in Buddhism there has always been a **very strong** respect to teachers. If you want to be Buddhist you have to respect the Buddha. I'm a direct disciple of Shaolin, thus in the direct line of disciples of Shakyamuni. Even my worse word has great value. Those of you who can't understand that and expect me to sugar coat everything and to be the face of sugar and to make you feel good about yourself by saying everything like asking for permission, I only can tell you that I'm very sorry for your false expectations and I won't live up to them. You should read again the sutras, you should read again the history of all Buddhist teachers and you will find a lot of surprises in relation to severity of the teachers and their ways. In comparison, my tones, even the ugliest ones, are nothing.  Independently, you should know that **feeling bad about yourself or your acts is the only way you will ever change something in your behavior, it's as much part of the process as feeling good about yourself until equanimity is achieved**.

**Now, I'm warning you: You still think like americans. You think of Buddhism like you think of a car: If I like it, I buy it. If the teacher does and says what I like, I hear him. If it makes me feel better, I think it. If it sounds reasonable to me, I give it a chance.**

But now I ask you, how if you only hear what you like, if you only think what makes you feel better and you only give a chance to what sounds reasonable to you in your current state, how then, are you going to change? Analyze this and you will discover that this sub-reddit is setting up the base of stagnation.

Now. I've never asked anything out of you. I gave you many teachings and posts which many of you said ""this is great, thanks a lot, it really helped me"". You even asked that one of them were on [the right bar](http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/ir691/a_faq_for_people_new_to_buddhism/). I've even offered you a chance to come with us to China and meet the masters there... [But now people are even insulting me and challenging me after all of my work here... and what's even worse, you approve this with your votes](http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/kte88/buddhism_doesnt_tell_you_what_you_want_to_hear/c2n52q4).

If you don't trust me, fine. I can deal with that. But the truth is that I can't teach people who don't trust me, nor any other teacher in the world could. Without trust you can't let something new in your life, and without anything new, you will start to decay.

I will tell you that I'm not going to change my ways, this because my ways aren't like so just for personal gratification, they are like that because in that way they teach what they need to teach. This is the way I got what I got, and some things can't be transferred in any other form. 

So, how do I mean for this to be solved? I will ask you a very simple thing:

**If you agree with what I'm saying in this post, I will only ask you that, next time, instead of saying ""I don't agree with this"" and then simply proceed to either offend me, fight me, attempt to discredit me, bother me in any way or downvote me... you first ask politely, without sarcasm, without nicknames: ""This is what I understood from what you wrote, am I reading it right?"", and you do so each time the thought ""this wrong"" comes up to your mind and the urge to rebate comes to your brain.**

**When I tell you ""yes, you got it right"",  then, and only then you rightfully say ""I don't agree with this"". If I don't, you accept that you didn't got it right and since that is the case, you can't neither agree or disagree with something you don't even got. Ok?**

If you tell me right now that you guys can't do this small thing that I'm asking, nothing happens, we are still friends, but one things is for sure: this is my last post in this forum because attempting to teach you anything will be mostly impossible for the reasons I've already explained and furthermore I don't want to contribute to the base of stagnation that you are implementing right now and your self-serving, self-revering, self-gratification attitude. This will only result in me wearing off, and you getting angry against me and/or what I claim to represent.

I hope it's not the case tho. Wait for your reply. Also, if you agree with this, you should apply this procedure to everyone else, not just with me.

"If ""life is suffering"", and Buddhism's goal is to eliminate suffering, shouldn't Buddhists just kill themselves?","Other faiths present various arguments that discourage suicide, while Buddhism - as far as I can tell - does not. For instance, in Christianity, suicide is immoral and ineffective: it is a sin, for which you will suffer eternally in the afterlife, so it makes no sense as means to escape suffering in this life.

In Buddhism, on the other hand, there is no afterlife, and the first Noble Truth (Dukkha) stipulates that existence necessarily leads to suffering, while earthly happiness is always ambivalent, temporary, and inevitably reverts back to pain and dissatisfaction.

Even believers of literal reincarnation hold that different incarnations aren't normally aware of each other. Thus, once we kill ourselves, according to Buddhism, that is the end - we will not be consciously aware of our past choice to kill ourselves, and even if we are, the natural remedy is to kill ourselves again...

Taken altogether, suicide would seem like a viable way to end personal suffering for good, without any possibility of punishment following it. Seeing as existence is suffering and lasting happiness is only possible through nibbƒÅna - an exceedingly difficult and rare achievement - why, according to Buddhism, should one not take the simple path and kill oneself?

P.S. I do not encourage suicide by anyone, including myself; this is a theoretical question about the views of Buddhism.",Buddhism,1495823734.0,t3_6dit2v,0.54,3
The Concept of Self as Expressed in MahƒÅyƒÅna MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa S≈´tra,"INTERNATIONAL BUDDHIST COLLEGE Arkady Fayngor Professor Dr. Fa Qing ME6102 Mahayna Buddhism 27 February 2013

The Concept of Self as Expressed in MahƒÅyƒÅna MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa S≈´tra


MahƒÅyƒÅna MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ a S≈´tra is one of the most famous text of MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism devoted to the positive affirmation of the eternal Self (or True Self) as opposed to impermanent non- self. The S≈´tra belongs to the group of Buddhist texts known as the ;TathƒÅgatagarbha S≈´tras As with the majority of MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras, the actual date of its creation is unknown.


Hajime Nakamura believes that ‚Äúit must have been compiled in the period 200-400 A.D.‚Äù (212). There are several existing translations of MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ a S≈´tra: ‚Äúthe shortest and earliest extant translated version is the translation into Chinese by Faxian and Buddhabhadra in six juan (418CE); the next in terms of scriptural development is the Tibetan version (c790CE) by Jinamitra, J√±ƒÅnagarbha and Devacandra; and the lengthiest version of all is what is known as the ‚ÄúNorthern version‚Äù in 40 juan by Dharmaksema (422CE)‚Äù (Page 1). 

In MahƒÅyƒÅna tradition the s≈´tra is believed to be the last teaching of the Buddha before entering into ParinirvƒÅna Although MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ a S≈´tra discusses various topics related to MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhist doctrine and practices, the particular attention of the present paper is given to the notion of True Self that is expressed in the S≈´tra. The great specialty of MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ a S≈´tra lies in the fact that it equates the Buddha-nature or tathƒÅgatagarbha present in every living being with the Self: ‚Äúformerly, Buddhism, advocating the theory of Non-ego, was against the theory of ƒÅtman, but here in this scripture the Buddha teaches the theory of Great ƒÄtman‚Äù (Nakamura 213). The Buddha explains in Chapter 12 of MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ a S≈´tra as follows: ""O good man! Self means Tathagatagarbha"" [Buddha-Womb, Buddha-Embryo, Buddha-Nature]. Every being has Buddha-Nature. This is the Self. Such Self has, from the very beginning, been under cover of innumerable defilements‚Äù (101). Equating tathƒÅgatagarbha with ƒÅtman is not only found in MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ a S≈´tra, but also in Avata saka S≈´tra. Buddha gives the following characteristics to the notion of Self: ‚ÄúThe Self (ƒÅtman) is reality (tattva), the Self is permanent (nitya), the Self is virtue (guna), the Self is eternal (≈õƒÅ≈õvatƒÅ), the Self is stable (dhruva), the Self is peace (siva)‚Äù Such a notion of eternal True Self is explained in opposition to the concept of non-self, which is our mistaken idea of ego: ‚Äúin contrast to our individual ego, Buddhism points us towards the Great Self which is the presence of the Dharma-Body in all of us, also known as Buddha-nature‚Äù **(Paraskevopoulos 23). MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa S≈´tra clearly defines what belongs to the realm of selflessness and what possesses the True Self: ‚ÄúNon-Self is Samsara, the Self is the Tathagata; impermanence is the sravakas and pratyekabuddhas, the Eternal is the Tathagata‚Äôs Dharmakaya; suffering is all tirthikas, Bliss is Nirvana; the impure is all compounded [samskrta] dharmas, the Pure is the true Dharma that the Buddha and Bodhisattvas have‚Äù** (29). Of course, such an exposition is rather unusual for the disciples of the Buddha who were previously trained by the TathƒÅgata to practice the contemplation on non-self. They express their perplexity and question the Buddha further. The answer given by the TathƒÅgata is rather definitive: ‚ÄúEven though he has said that all phenomena [dharmas] are devoid of the Self, it is not that they are completely/truly devoid of the Self. What is this Self? Any phenomenon <br> [dharma] that is true [satya], real [tattva], eternal [nitya], sovereign/autonomous/self-governing

[aisvarya], and whose ground/foundation is unchanging [asraya-aviparinama], is termed ‚Äôthe Self‚Äô [atman]‚Äù(32). **Such a reply seems to have no room for any other interpretation but the literal one. The Buddha cautions his disciples not to fall into a one-sided view of seeing only emptiness and suffering in everything, which he compares with taking stones for gems.**  He further instructs to ‚Äústudy well the Way, how to act, wherever you go, and ‚Äúmeditate on the Self, the Eternal, Bliss, and the Pure‚Äù (30). To illustrate this idea, the Buddha tells the simile of the King and the Skillful Doctor in Chapter 3 called ‚ÄúOn Grief‚Äù. In very short rendering, this simile talks about the skillfulness of the Doctor who first prohibited to cure all sicknesses with a milk medicine, because such was the practice of an unskilled doctor before him. However, later on when the King himself got ill, the Doctor prescribed him the milk medicine, since he saw that it can help the King. **In the same way the Buddha first wanted to subdue the unskillful methods of the teachers before him by saying ‚Äúthere is no self, no man, no being, no life, no nurturing, no knowing, none that does, and none that receives‚Äù (MMPNS 32). A very significant sentence uttered by the Buddha right after that explains why he teaches the doctrine of non- self: ‚ÄúThis is to adjust beings and because he is aware of the occasion.‚Äù Therefore, the idea of non-self is used by the Buddha as skillful means to adjust to the level of understanding of his disciples.** It is explained in Chapter 12: ‚ÄúEngaging in the notion that there is no Self with regard to the mundane self, they do not understand the skilful words of implicational purport of the TathƒÅgata ‚Ä¶ They have the notion that there is no Self and are unable to know the True Self‚Äù (Page 3-4). In the Chapter 10 ‚ÄúOn The Four Truths‚Äù, the Buddha further warns his disciples of the wrong view of applying the characteristics of impermanent Samsara to the eternal domain of TathƒÅgata: ‚ÄúAny person who says that the Three Treasures are non-eternal and holds this view of life, then this is a false way of practice and is not the noble truth of the Way‚Äù (98). Such a person ‚Äúannuls what is right and won‚Äôt allow it to live. On account of this, that person does not know ‚ÄúDharmata‚Äù [essence of Reality]. Not knowing this, he repeats birth and death and suffers greatly‚Äù (97). **The Tibetan version of MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ a S≈´tra contains even a greater caution in the same chapter: ‚ÄúBy having cultivated non-Self with reference to the tathƒÅgata-dhƒÅtu and having continually cultivated Emptiness, suffering will not be eradicated, but one will become like a moth in the flame of a lamp‚Äù.** Based on the above, we can see that, as claimed by the MahƒÅyƒÅna tradition, the final teaching of the Buddha before entering into ParinirvƒÅna, has a very radical position on the Self. Although the Buddha did not deny the traditional characterization of all dharmas belonging to the world of Samsara as impermanent, suffering, selfless and impure, such characteristics must not be applied to the domain of NirvƒÅna According to Williams, ‚ÄúThis s≈´tra is quite categoric in asserting that the error here lies in looking in the wrong direction ‚Äì in other words that finally there is an equal error in seeing impermanence where there is permanence, suffering where there is happiness, not-Self where there is Self, and impurity where there is purity, in failing to see the positive element in Buddhahood which contrasts with the negative realm of unenlightenment‚Äù (109). Nakamura states that the origins of such a position ‚Äúcan be traced to ancient times... a precursor of the concept of Buddhahood can be noticed even in Abhidharma MahƒÅvibhƒÅ a ≈öƒÅstra ·π£ ‚Äù (213). The TathƒÅgatagarbha S≈´tras in general talk about the Buddha-Nature as existing in all living beings, but in the case of earlier S≈´tras, prior to MahƒÅparinirvƒÅna S≈´tra, it was used more in a sense of describing the inherent potential in all beings to become a Buddha.

Although the purport of the teaching on the Self in MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ a S≈´tra is the subject of an ongoing debate among the scholars , it undoubtedly explains the concept of True Self. Williams writes that ‚Äúthe MahƒÅparinirvƒÅna S≈´tra teaches a really existing, permanent element ... in sentient beings. It is this element which enables sentient beings to become Buddhas‚Äù. In whichever way we can understand

the notion of True Self, it is absolutely clear that MahƒÅparinirvƒÅna S≈´tra represents the positive aspect of the reality of NirvƒÅna and TathƒÅgata which is frequently forgotten or overlooked in the field of Buddhist studies and practice.

Countless are woman's defects. 
My elephantine mind has fallen 
Into the poisonous swamp of guile. 
So I must renounce the world. 
- Naropa, Tibetan mystic poet 

Some say that learning seems not tobe the business of women. I say that . . . control of the mind is of theutmost importance to women, and it would be a great mistake to say that itis not their business. The outward manner and temper of women is rooted in the negative (yin) power, and so temperamentally women are apt to be sensitive, petty, narrow, and jaundiced. Confinement results in limited vision. Consequently, among women compassion and honesty are rare indeed. That is why Buddhism says that women are particularly sinfuland have the greatest difficulty in attaining Buddhahood. Thus women are in special need of mental discipline. 
- Toju, Zen Master

The satanic bible,"I don‚Äôt know how I came across it, but I bought the satanic bible- might have kissed it (at the time I really liked how it pointed out hypocrisy) and read about 40 pages but it triggered an intense rage where I blew up verbally on 2 of my family members for things they did in the past (I come from a family practicing Islam.)

After that fact, I felt horrible and threw away the book and that was about a year ago. I stopped practicing Islam several years ago and go to a Buddhist temple by me as well as meditate at times and more recently am trying to read up on more compassion and general kindness. 

Since coming from an Islamic background, I cannot shake this horrible feeling that I lost a piece of my soul simply possessing the satanic bible. Again I‚Äôve tried to forgive myself and I will certainly never touch an occult book like that again. Even though I feel Islam isn‚Äôt for me, I want to say it respectfully. I was saying some really nasty things about God when I possessed that book and was being very prideful. I‚Äôve since apologized outwardly wto their God and felt that was a very nasty thing to do.

Christopher lee has a video on YouTube where he says to not touch occult books because people lose their mind and soul. I have this terrible fear and haven‚Äôt slept well in a week thinking I have to go back to Islam and repent- which I‚Äôve been doing and it‚Äôs still horrible.

I simply want to acknowledge that I know I made a mistake - again I threw away the book- and forgive myself and move on.

But my closest family members - I couldn‚Äôt imagine if I told them- so now I feel I have this horrific little secret I can‚Äôt share with anyone.

I like reading this book called the way of peace and it just focuses on kindness and compassion- why can‚Äôt I just move on without feeling I lost  a piece of my soul? It‚Äôs REALLY messing with me.",Buddhism,1670082648.0,t3_zbjbba,0.6,8

Secular Buddhism: Not a noble path,"One of the things that fascinates me about a transcendence-denying reading of the teachings of the suttas is that it requires so many things that otherwise fit together very nicely to be interpreted as craftily encoded by the Buddha. From the concept of world-transcendence to kamma, to rebirth, to pain, to old age, to disease and death (as included explicitly in the definition of dukkha) to dukkha overall to deathlessness, to the self, to self-refuge, Nibbana, Brahman...the list goes on and on of things that the secular Buddhist must say the Buddha didn't really mean to say in those terms at all. What he meant, they continually have to assert, is that when he uses these terms that resemble ideas from a mystical teaching, he has really just borrowed them as perhaps hyperbolic symbols of a wholly secular system of ""salvation."" Even liberation or salvation itself doesn't really mean liberation unless one is able to decode it and what one is liberated from correctly, it just means perception of conditionality and psychological adjustment to it as reality. In other words, to successfully decode the Buddhadhamma for the secularist, we almost only need to reverse the meaning. Liberation means knowing you are not really free, self refers to what is not self, Parinibbana means extinction, etc. What is remarkable about this tremendous work of interpretation is that it is never found to be decoded as such by the Buddha himself in the suttas, and this is remarkable because the Buddha of the suttas is famously very good at explaining the detailed meaning of the terms he chooses to use. For example, if you want to see what he means by ""birth,"" he tells us quite plainly that it means being born in the usual sense (whether from an egg or from a womb, etc), not an abstraction. And he says that this happens to the worldling after death. And if you want to know what he means by death in that kind of statement, he explains that too. And it's nothing so abstract...it means simply death in the usual sense that people die at the end of their life. And so on....So the secular decoding of the Buddha's teaching occurs wholly in the enlightened too-modern imagination of the secularist who, being too reasonable to believe in spooks, must, if they are to continue to be interested in Buddhism, be convinced that the Buddha was a secular agnostic. ~ Vacca, [The Zennist](http://zennist.typepad.com/zenfiles/2011/03/secular-buddhism-not-a-noble-path.html)",Buddhism,1417497352.0,t3_2o0omy,0.56,6
The Modern Outlook on Mental Health is a Scam,"The western world is finally putting some attention onto the state of our mental well-being but to no surprise it's methods lead to weaker self-esteem and an increase in medication. If people were to properly understand dependent origination they would be able to spot, with clear eyes, where their issues begin and how they snowball. As it currently stands the way these ""deficiencies"" are presented leads teens and young adults to ""accept"" they are depressed, have anxiety, bi-polar, etc. which leads them to label themselves as such. The label itself insinuates the deficiency is a part of their biology, they were just born like this, or past abuse cemented it. All this does is de-motivate the individual from investigating why they feel the way they do. That entire thought process is removed from the present moment and stuck in thoughts of the past. 

As it stands now, people are encouraged to delve deep into their past but they stop after that. This encourages a victim mentality, leaving people clueless about the most important fact: all that there is, is this current moment. The past does not exist. This constant state of change allows everything to happen, including you cutting off the causes that lead to certain thoughts from arising. The reason you are fully in control of your experience is because you have the possibility of changing what comes and goes within your mind. The thoughts aren't you, they simply show up because the recipe for them was assembled. Learn to prevent this assembly by watching your thoughts. Be an observer, train your mind to not run away with these thoughts, and most importantly realize they aren't ""you"". Every single thing that happened to you in your life doesn't make ""you"" either, but it did effect your mind's thoughts. This is the practical application of the No Self teaching. Too many people think they are their mind, so when they notice it's such a mess, they naturally think they are a mess as well, preventing any chance of discovering the mind is trainable like a muscle. 

It is frustrating that so many people live in hell and feel helpless about their situation, ignoring a universal law that is dependent origination. One solves their relationship with mental health when they contemplate the 4NTs, where the ""aha!"" moment comes and you realize just how deep and multi-faceted the teachings really are.",Buddhism,1662256507.0,t3_x5axgs,0.4,0
Buddhism without devas or deities.,"I've been practicing bhuddhism for a while, but I do not believe in all the deities, devas and demons.

So depending on which sect you follow there is often different beings depending on those areas. I just don't believe or connect with these beliefs.
Is there sect of Buddhism that doesn't include them in their teachings or is it something I just have to exclude from my own beliefs while practicing? Or even just books of teachings I can read that don't include them? I'm currently reading an Anthology of discourse form the Polish Canon by Bhikkhu Bodhi and there is alot of focus on them.

Why is Buddhism so sex negative?,"I‚Äôve done my reading and spent my time reading what people on this subreddit have to say- and frankly i‚Äôm still lost and discouraged. It seems any buddhist who just simply explain how overindulgence and irritation for something we want is all that you need to be mindful of and things like sex aren‚Äôt a bad thing. Yet it seems plenty more just want everyone to live a celibate life- even if you have no plans to be a monk. 

Why does buddhism give me the impression time and time again sex is this evil act that can only have one purpose and is something that should never be done ever? *And yes i‚Äôm aware plenty may just explain about the cycle of birth and reincarnation- i know all that. but that‚Äôs not what i‚Äôm asking for really. Cause that‚Äôs only going to resonate with a monk, not your everyday person who just wants to live a good life and not deprive themselves of everything life has to offer.  

Sure sex isn‚Äôt a Need like food and sleep- no one dies from never having sex. But why is it buddhists say that and then go on to say ‚Äúbecause of this you should never do it as it is meaningless.‚Äù

Sex is more than just babies. Sex wouldn‚Äôt feel good just for the sake of making sure people kept getting knocked up. So why this back and forth with buddhists stating from their own readings that sex is either a good and healthy thing or a vile and bad thing?

Hell, I could argue having sex just because your biological body tells you to procreate is worse than non procreative sex because at least non procreative sex could just be that bonding loving connection between two people, and not just some biological command. Anyone after menopause can still have sex and a desire for that sexual connection/intimacy, it‚Äôs just some don‚Äôt feel the need as much as strongly for as when they were younger. So why shame people into saying you shouldn‚Äôt have sex if you can‚Äôt get pregnant out of it? Half the people here can‚Äôt even agree if gay sex is bad. 

I‚Äôm not training to be a monk, so why is it this buddhist religion is telling me I need to be one? why are buddhists not taking into consideration any person of any orientation sees sex more as just a carnal desire? why do i not hear one buddhist talk about how wonderful making love to a partner is and how it‚Äôs good and not evil? Cause i read one too many on this subreddit alone that has no problem going into great detail how sex is just some dirty minded activity that should not exist ever- how a loving couple can‚Äôt ever make love when they ever so want to.

That Buddhism is a reformation of Hinduism is hereby refuted,"One of the convenient narratives of Western Indologists is that Hinduism was debased due to the caste system, and Gautama attempted to reform it and in doing so broke away from Hindu ideas and ideals.

At stake is the entire basis on which Hindu and Buddhist societies are organized. The claim made by Western Indologists is that Hinduism believes in a birth-based caste system (you are a Brahmin, Shudra, Kshatriya, etc., iff your parents are Brahmin, Shudra, Kshatriya, etc., respectively) while Buddhism repudiates the entire classification of people into four varnas and preaches against it.

In this post, I will refute this oft-made but mistaken claim.

----

My evidences are the following.

(1)In the Mahabharata, a serpent poses a question to Yudhishtra as to who is a Brahmin and who is a Shudra. Yudhishtra replies that one is a Brahmin by conduct and not by birth. A supposed ""shudra"" who has Brahmin-like qualities is a Brahmin. A supposed ""Brahmin"" who does not have the appropriate qualities is a shudra.

https://imgur.com/a/3zskb

>A Brahmin is one in whom truthfulness, charity, forgiveness, good conduct, lack of cruelty, self-control and compassion can be seen...If these traits, not even found in a Brahmin are seen in a shudra, he is not a shudra. A Brahmin in whom a brahmin's traits are not found, is a shudra...Before initiation into knowledge of the Vedas, everyone is a shudra by conduct.

(2)The Sonadanda Sutta records a conversation between a student and Buddha about the true qualities of a Brahmin. The full exchange can be found here:

http://buddhasutra.com/files/sonadanda_sutta.htm

The important paragraphs are:

>""Angaka is handsome, good-looking, pleasing, of supremely fair complexion, in form and countenance like Brahma, of no mean appearance, and there is none in this assembly his equal except the ascetic Gotama.  He is a scholar‚Ä¶I was his mantra-teacher.  He is well-born on both sides‚Ä¶I know his parents.  But if Angaka were to take life, take what is not given, commit adultery, tell lies and drink strong drinks - what would good looks, mantras, or birth profit him?  But it is because a Brahmin is virtuous‚Ä¶because he is wise‚Ä¶on account of these two points that he can truthfully declare:  ""I am a Brahmin.""

>""But, Brahmin, if one were to omit one of these two points, could one truthfully declare:  ""I am a Brahmin?""   ""No, Reverend Gotama.  For wisdom is purified by morality, and morality is purified by wisdom:  where one is, the other is, the moral man has wisdom and the wise man has morality, and the combination of morality and wisdom is called the highest thing in the world.  Just as one hand washes the other, or one foot the other, so wisdom is purified by morality and this combination is called the highest thing in the world.""

>""So it is, Brahmin.  Wisdom is purified by morality, and morality is purified by wisdom:  where one is, the other is, the moral man has wisdom and the wise man has morality, and the combination of morality and wisdom is called the highest thing in the world.

One cannot both be a capitalist and a buddhist,"In the most basic, inseparable way Capitalism requires the expropriation of surplus value produced by labor to be turned into private profit. This undeniably is a form of stealing. There would not be any profit if it were not for the reality of surplus value produced by the working class through wage slavery.

The basic mechanic of capitalist production is such that the normative relation between labor and production to meet human needs is completely rejected in favor of the endless growth model and profit drive (finance capital compounded for its own sake). Therefore capitalism is inherently defiled and anti-buddhist.

Additionally, capitalism is rooted in many other defined mindsets:
cynicism, egoism, self aggrandizement, usury, clinging to material possessions, utilitarianism, neglecting the poor and dispossessing people of basic necessities.

Capitalism reduces everyone to a unit of monetary value, or some cog in the equation of yielding profit for the owner class. Objectification, commodification, etc. are the crux of it.  And all this is done to fulfill the need of the ruling class to exploit.

This is all quite contrary to the buddhist path, and to defend capitalism is to defend delusion and wrong views but also to sanction the violence of oppressors upon the oppressed. Every eviction, homeless camp destroyed, mentally ill addict imprisoned and brutalized‚Ä¶ then add all the orwellian things business do to employees like censoring speech, loving them in a building to die in a tornado, forcing workers to urinate in bottles rather than use the restroom, Violently suppressing workers movements and strikes. etc etc etc.

The application of capitalism is violence.

Unfortunately capitalism and western bias have heavily distorted and co-opted buddhism with individualism mindfulness and self help junk.

Capitalists co-opt everything they can, and buddhism is no different. They distort buddhist teaching and water it down to the most ineffectual and harmless state. They have rendered buddhism into a cult of secular, therapeutic, self improvement, calming, sedating, placating entirety by which the ruling class can convince the oppressed class into accepting their exploitation and blaming themselves. 
Instead of calling out the exploiters for their misdeeds, capitalist buddhism has people believing that they should accept capitalism and all its problems as the natural state of things; and if you‚Äôre unhappy term is your own fault because ‚Äúwhat you think about you bring about.‚Äù
Mindfulness has became a means by which the bosses can get the workers to work more efficiently and more be more docile.

I don't believe the Buddhist was an atheist.,"I'm not even sure I believe he was a non-theist. I have heard of the story of him addressing a Brahmin and talking about how he doesn't think it makes sense that a creator God exists, seeing as how there is free will and also that there is evil and suffering in the world.

The Buddha was great at thought/heart experiments. He was silent on so many questions including that of God in other dialouges. So why address it elsewhere? 

The Buddha's ethics were his focus. The Eightfold path aims to alleviate suffering. As others have pointed out, he often found metaphysics not useful. But I think it's a mistake for people to jump to insinuations about God/or no God as an endorsement on the matter.

Similarly, anatta is a discourse on attachement to self. Whether or not  there is a soul is not the issue. The obvious change we undergo day by day, year by year, is suggested as a reason not to feel attached to self.

Is everyone unhappy? Do buddhists say so?,"Hey all,

One thing that is making my head spin is that Buddhists seem to say that the only path in life is the path of enlightenment and that can truly set you free and grant happiness. 

The first noble truth is that life contains suffering. While I definitely know this to be true, and everyone suffers to some extent, i think there is a big bias in people that meditate and pursue it with great rigor.  

There are a lot of people who are suffering but are also a lot of times quite happy. There are definitely people who seem to be very present, see the good in people, love themselves and others, have good relationships and a fulfilling job and have meaning in their life - yet never meditated. Overall they seem happy. And if you ask them they would also say they are happy and love their life. I‚Äôve seen those people in all economic classes - from rich to poor.

I‚Äôm wondering why it seems (and please correct me if im wrong, im not certain lol) buddhists have the ‚Äòwisdom‚Äô to deny the above and say that everyone has suffering and cultivating the path is the only way to end suffering and therefore this is the only path. Some suffering combined with joy and fulfillment may be perfectly fine for a lot of people. It seems to me like buddhists say ‚Äòi know you say you are happy, but listen, you just haven‚Äôt introspected enough, you really contain a lot of suffering, you‚Äôre not happy trust me‚Äô. 

lets do a thought experiment. A perfectly happy construction worker with not the highest IQ (sorry for the generalization here) that loves working with his hands, loves himself, has compassion, has a lovely wife, looks forwards to having children, has a good group of buddies and generally feels well. Does he have suffering? Sure, like everyone. Life will not always go as planned, there is craving, disappointment, etc. But if you ask him on a random day ‚Äòhow happy are you?‚Äô He‚Äôd rate his day a 8.5/10. 

Now a buddhist comes along and says ‚Äòlook my friend, you are suffering, you may not know it, but you are, come to my monastery and devote yourself to Buddhism.‚Äô

Now his life is just meditating, he‚Äôs unhappy because he doesn‚Äôt get most stuff conceptually and he‚Äôs bored. He probably doesn‚Äôt get (fully) enlightened (as most monks dont get that). Even if he does get it, it probably takes many many years. Maybe he‚Äôs 70 before it clicks. Was ‚Äòthe path‚Äô really the best path? Lets abstract from rebirth and just focus on this one life. 

I understand that there are people that are genuinely suffering, and if you feel the need to do long silent retreats and devote yourself to buddhism there is probably a lot that went into that decision and there was (as a western person) probably a lot that caused suffering in your life. I just fail to understand why Buddhists think this is the path for everyone, and why they do not accept that some people are generally happy (they love their life).",Buddhism,1692137782.0,t3_15s6xca,0.5,0
I had a dream where I was getting baptised into Buddhism and I had no connection to it in real life. Do you know what it could be related to?,"Hi all. I feel I needed to ask this here. I'm not too familiar with this sub or Buddhism but I need help.

I had a dream I was getting baptised into Buddhism and in the dream I was instructed to throw myself into the water with force, the water needed to hit my face and body with force.
I was then told to stop using substances (in real life I only take herbs to help with dreaming and astral projection, nothing illegal or psychedelic). I was then told that I will become successful in business in due course, and that I need to focus on my career for now and business success will only happen later on in the course of my career ( again, I am frustrated with my job and jt downer pay that great and I am desperate to start and succeed at a business).

Looking for counter-arguments to my argument against rebirth,"**1.)** If rebirth is true, then one of these two (but not both) must also be true:

A) All beings are subject to rebirth. That means frogs, mosquitoes, mollusks, plants, and even single-celled organisms undergo rebirth.

B) Only some beings are subject to rebirth. That means at some point in evolution, an organism not subject to rebirth produced offspring that is subject to rebirth.

**2.)** Both A and B are intuitively nonsensical. In A, it's hard to make sense of what it would even mean for a single-celled organism or a plant to undergo rebirth. In B, it's hard to make sense of how a shift from non-rebirth-beings to rebirth-beings could possibly happen in biological evolution.

 **3.)** If A and B are nonsensical, then rebirth is nonsensical, too.

Contradictions I've noticed within this philosophy. Also I've come to the conclusion that the self does exist. Am I correct or just missing the point entirely?,"I'm not a Buddhist, but I have been meditating pretty consistently for about 2 years. I've been listening to some lectures about Buddhism in general so I probably don't know very much but I think I get the general idea. I'll keep it short.

The buddha talks about aversion as one of the things that keeps you suffering. Aversion is the avoidance of unpleasant feelings/thoughts/emotions, etc. Also desiring keeps you suffering as well. So... when you desire not to suffer and pursue buddhism... is that not considered both desire and aversion in itself? That makes absolutely zero sense. Avoiding leads to suffering but desiring to avoid suffering leads to not suffering when avoidance is the thing that leads to suffering. Its a paradox.

Secondly, he says that there is no concrete self and I have a gripe with this because its such an overly reductionist perspective that doesn't make sense either. I'm a science student and I also think in a reductionist mindset because that's what I want to study. So I get where mans is coming from, but I propose this. Everyone is familiar with the 5 aggregates, and if you separate them then that's just a bunch of other moving parts that are contributing to the sense of self but it doesn't really ""exist"" because it's just made up of a bunch of other parts that are not it. That's wrong though because humans are conscious, and do exist. If you didn't exist, you wouldn't be reading this. Life is just a bunch of moving parts that have smaller moving parts that have smaller moving parts. Humans have organs, and organs are made of cells. And cells are made of biomolecules. Biomolecules are made of atoms. You get the picture. If you take a couple of neurons, those are just neurons. String enough together you get the intelligence of a cat. Take 100 billion and that's a good ol' human brain. Buddha had the 5 aggregates basically correct to how psychology understands consciousness now, I don't like how he splits them up categorically and the language is fuzzy, but its pretty close. The self is the sum of its parts. It's not an illusion. The self exists. It's just a combination of the awareness bestowed to us by a bunch of cells tied up in super complex ways and the experiences those cells undergo as a human. The self is ever changing. Your body and mind are also ever changing but we still consider them to exist. We should do the same with the self. 

Buddhism is supposed to bring you peace but going this deep has brought me nothing but existential dread. Also predicating an entire way of living based on the subjective experience of 1 human that has cognitive biases like all the rest of us that has also been passed down and manipulated by other humans with their own cognitive biases sounds like a bit of a crazy thing to take as gospel truth. 

Please feel free to argue with me and try to change my perspective as I am open to scrutiny within my logic as I have scrutinized essentially the entirety of buddhism on a buddhism sub lmao.",Buddhism,1666393326.0,t3_ya7g1h,0.44,0
Lama Ole: How can we maintain the pure view?," I recently saw this posted on facebook.

I thought it was really poignant and clear, and worth sharing.

&#x200B;

How can we maintain the pure view?

Lama Ole‚Äôs answer:

Imagine your mind is a cigar factory. You are only producing cigars for millionaires, twenty dollars apiece. You check their color and smell; you check the sound they make when you squeeze them. If they are good enough you accept them, if not you send them off to be processed into cigarettes or loose tobacco.

That is exactly what it‚Äôs about‚Äîonly accepting the best thoughts and feelings. One could also say that there should be something pure in everything that has to do with you. On the highest level, samsara and nirvana are one. Every atom vibrates with joy and is held together by love. Every thought and feeling, even the most stupid, is fantastic on the absolute level just because it can happen.

If you make sure to feel good, you will experience the world as beautiful‚Äîeverything as wonderful and meaningful. Remember that everybody has innate buddha nature. Decide to experience everything as fresh and new and to see the beauty in all that happens.

It is important to understand that highest truth means highest joy. My mind works in a very simple way: I have an automatic function, a discarding function. If there is something that feels bad or strange, my mind tells me, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to worry about that; there is no truth in it. It must be a mistake in today‚Äôs manufacturing process or some kind of contaminant.‚Äù But if there is something that feels beautiful and pleasant, my mind says, ‚ÄúOh, you seem to be approaching something true!‚Äù And then my mind goes in that direction.

It functions automatically, and I always have good time. I just connect truth with joy and untruth with a lower level of functioning. Highest joy is highest truth. There is no separation.

It is important to have a feeling of surplus. If you have that, you will generally do good things. If your motivation is right, you don‚Äôt have to check every word. Every action will be well-rounded and benefit others. But if you have a sour feeling, for example, then even if you watch every word you say, you will still make mistakes. People will get mad at you because they‚Äôll feel your vibration and reflect it back to you.

So it‚Äôs better to develop the ability to see things on the highest possible level. If you can do that, you will automatically become compassionate, loving, and beyond-personal, and you will do nothing wrong.

So, the closer to the head you catch the snake, the less it will be able to disturb you. Just try to go into the world with a good feeling. Make sure you are doing well, and wish everybody something good. If you then do, think, or say anything harmful, five red warning lights will flash up at once.

Of course, one cannot grasp at holding the highest view the same way one cannot grasp at meditation. On the outer level, we can avoid doing things that will certainly pull us down. On the inner level, we should also make sure that compassion and wisdom are present, and on the highest level we maintain the view. But actually, the experience of the highest view appears spontaneously and effortlessly by itself; one cannot force it.

You can only make sure that you always identify more truth with more joy. And this way you can develop a very fine inner sense for knowing whether you are moving away from or getting closer to your inner light, whether you are doing something honest and well-rounded or are becoming a bit distant and unclear.

The mind develops many subtle bells and red lights that help one be aware in everything that happens.",Buddhism,1655164610.0,t3_vbq40x,0.55,2

The middle path of traditional vs non,"Buddhism can be frustrating.  


Speaking only for myself, Buddhism is about liberation of all beings from suffering.    
There is no point in thinking of liberating myself, as there is no self, everything is everything else.   


So reading posts about sect related issues, cosmology, concepts, just frustrates me.  
Its not that I dont believe in these things, attempting to be secular, its that these things dont take priority to me over the primary point which is liberating all beings from suffering.   


Why would I get caught up in the temporal matters of people and their standing in a tradition, or what age I am in, when none of these are things I can control, and none of these feel as if they really have anything to do with ending suffering for all beings.   Maybe I just dont get it.   Thats ok, Id rather know I wasnt getting it.  


  
Im ok with the idea of nearly anything, as ideas can evolve, they can expand, they can grow, or shrink, they can change.  Beliefs are rigid.   I believe there was a Buddha, I believe he attained enlightenment, I believe in his teachings and in the Sangha.   I seek to keep the rigidity that may come from that at a minimum less I start holding a bag of sand, thinking it was my dead son, when all the while my dead son was right there, alive, all along.  I am open to the ideas of everything else, and not closed off against them.   However on the other end, I would find believing in them to a point of elimination of other ideas to be missing the point.

A personal theory about the nature of samsara.,"Imagine a source of light, such as a sun, appearing in an endless dead void.

As the light spreads through the void, any region it reaches is first enlightened just a tiny bit. Gradually, more light seeps in. The region grows increasingly luminous, until eventually, there's no difference between it and the center of the light source. It has, in fact, become a new part of the original light source. The process continues in the same way, in regions beyond the one we just examined. The process as a whole can be described simply as the original light source **growing**.

Now consider the light source as Nibbana, the ultimate, infinite **freedom**. As it grows, it first creates regions with a tiny degree of freedom: **inanimate matter**. Which only has the freedom to take up space.

As more light seeps in, forms with greater degree of freedom are created: **living forms**.

Initially these are merely plants, which have very limited freedom, for example to grow and shape themselves.

Eventually animals will emerge. Animals have more freedom than plants, and as they evolve from simple single-cell organism, to more sophisticated complex organisms composed of numerous cells and organs, their degree of freedom grows.

They acquire growing levels of consciousness, and increasingly approach **contemplative consciousness**, which we have as humans and is a quantum leap in freedom, though in some ways a double-edged sword.

At some basic level, every thing which exists is endowed with a **tendency to exist**. In inanimate matter, this is manifest in how matter will remain the same - not change or move at all - unless forced to by some external force. Plants clearly struggle to survive, just consider the sapling or even blade of grass twisting itself towards the light necessary for its survival.

For every living thing, the desire to exist is clearly a fundamental quality. As the life form evolves, this desire is buttressed by instincts that grow ever more sophisticated, until they mature into **consciousness**, which in a sense is the ultimate survival instinct. The animal is now able to reflect about its own survival, and thus secure it far more effectively, notably by responding to external (desirable) opportunities and (undesirable) threats.

The drive to survive becomes increasingly more conscious and deliberate, until it ripens fully into **contemplative consciousness**, which allowed us humans to build weapons and forts and granaries and take over the planet. However, contemplative consciousness can direct itself freely towards any object, including - reflectively - **its own self**, its own nature and the very nature of existence (which is of course a purely mental phenomena - we are not aware of anything outside our consciousness, including its sense impressions and thoughts. Literally nothing else exists for us, and existence itself is consciousness.)

This level of consciousness is the ultimate goal of the process because **such consciousness can contemplate and ultimate realize its own true nature**. This teaching is not exclusive to Buddhism or even all of Eastern philosophy: The maxim ""know thyself"" was carved into the gate of the Temple of Apollo - God of reason - in Delphi, and later made a cornerstone of Western philosophy by Socrates and Plato.

Indeed, this knowledge isn't so much **learning of the new**, but **a return** to the source of infinite knowledge. With enlightenment, consciousness is able to **come back to its source**, the great light whence its own light came: Nibbana. For example, Socrates taught there is no such thing as ""learning something new"", only **remembering that which is already there but obscured by ignorance**. It's all there, just obscured by the veil of avijjƒÅ. Sounds familiar?

What I like about this theory is that it elegantly answers a question that bothered me for a while: **the nature of the defilements**.

According to this theory, the defilements are not some external pollution, but just **a primitive state of enlightenment**. The defiled state is merely **a state of transition between absent and absolute freedom**. It's a spectrum stretching from complete ignorance (absence of life) to full knowledge, realization, and freedom.

Contemplative consciousness, and its functional product - free will - allow us to reverberate any sensation by reflecting upon it.

As stated before, this is a double edged sword.

We can choose to reflect, and thus multiply, upon our own survival instincts. That is an extremely popular topic of contemplation, given how prominent these instincts are for us, descendants of animals, and can be seen as quite natural given how consciousness itself can be seen as a product of these survival instincts and a sophisticated tool for survival.

Contemplating upon our survival instincts multiplies them ad-infinitum, such that simple animal instincts for food and safety are multiplied into greed, and greed becomes infinite - an infinite hunger, first for sensual stimulation, but later, when the capacity of our senses to take in more stimulation is exhausted, we **abstract our desires** into purely symbolic forms: hunger for infinite amounts of power, money, ""fame"", etc.

This is how karma is created.

This self-reflecting, self-reverberating process can amplify every sensation. That is why humans can suffer so much more than animals, let alone plants or inanimate objects.

An animal will always be struck by the single arrow alone. A human, contemplating this strike, will reverberate it, striking his own self with the second, third, fourth, any number of arrows of repeated conscious thought.

The most evolved humans, with the greatest level of consciousness, are thus those with the greatest capacity to inflict suffering upon themselves.

This whole process of conscious, deliberate contemplation is the root of karma, and I expect that animals cannot create karma, or only minimally, due to their nearly absent level of consciousness.

This is the capacity of the beings with contemplative consciousness: to **ill-use it to amplify their own attachments**. The principal attachment to existence, which Buddhism calls ta·πáhƒÅ, and its two subsidiaries: desire for states that appear to aid and enhance survival (lobha), aversion for states that seem to hinder and diminish survival (dosa). These are both accompanied by the necessary factor that will makes attachment to existence itself seem crucial: the obscuration of the light source whence consciousness originated, or in Buddhist terms **its own true nature**. Or in Pali, moha.

So far about the capacity of contemplative consciousness to amplify its base instincts and create karma. But it can also be directed towards itself, and if done correctly, realize its own true nature.

In this process, it will realize that **the self is nothing more than a powerful, involved, and sophisticated complex of survival instincts**.

The ultimate achievement possible for consciousness can be attained with correct direction at contemplating its own self, raising doubt at its instinctual representation of the world (name and form, nama rupa) as a symbolic battleground of desire and aversion, where the goal is survival and existence. Exposing delusions such as the possibility of physical forms persisting forever, without change or death - the ultimate survival fantasy, the delusion to satisfy all our primitive instinctual drives to survive. Or another delusion, that if only we attain our next goal - that next promotion, sexual conquest, house, car, extra figure in our bank balance - we will abide in eternal bliss in this very life. Of course, our instincts will never relent in their battle to survive and multiply, our happiness is not their goal, and reaching any milestone will only allow them to pull us pitilessly towards the next, until we exhaust our survival and procreation potential and our body breaks apart.

(There are associated delusions, mostly symbolic. For example, most people delude themselves that they can continue ""living"" through their children, legacy, people who remember them, etc - thus the fear of ""being forgotten"", and all our weird rituals around death and commemorating the dead.)

By realizing our true nature, our inseparable union with the great light source - Nibbana - we can abandon the primitive halfway state of existence. As we progress towards this realization, it is as if our bodies become more illuminated. Eventually, there is only the light, and physical existence is abandoned.

This can also be conceptualized as a gradual process of **refining one substance to another**. For example, refining crude oil into gasoline. Initially there is just crude oil (or more accurately, there is nothing). Then there's 1%, 2%, 3% gasoline (or more luminous). Increasingly, the partially refined substance exhibits less qualities of the crude oil (dumb, compulsive attachment) and more qualities of the gasoline (infinite freedom). Eventually, there is only gasoline (or pure light without darkness, or the opposite of nothing: everything).

The defiled state is just a half-state somewhere between these two extremes.

I very much welcome comments. To give some context, this theory was born out of intense contemplation of a question that always bothered me: why are there defilements?

"My Selfish Buddhism, in which liberation is self-serving, and compassion is a defilement","For as a long as I can remember, I wanted to be unconditionally free.

Even as a five years old, I sought to get away from other people, and spent  every possible moment by myself. I didn't want to get involved or attached to anyone.

This liberation I view as **self-serving**: I want to be **personally** free of suffering or coercion.

I view compassion / caring as a trap that *causes* or *is* attachment - effectively, a defilement. I generally elect to detach from other people rather than get involved or care about them.

For the longest time I refused to date. When I eventually did, it felt like giving into my weaknesses, and for the most part, I didn't actually care about the girls I dated. I just had _desires_ for them, and an _attachment_ to them, both of which I viewed as **problems**, and was always striving to eradicate.

They had desires and attachments to me, of course, but they also had compassion and caring mixed into them, while I generally didn't. I am starting to realize that mixing compassion into desire may redeem it, to an extent.

My view of Buddhism, you would see as distorted. I admire the Buddha for being **strong**, perfectly free, in complete mastery of himself, needing nothing nor nobody. All the teachings about compassion, I see them as bizarre misguided bullshit, antithetical to Buddhism's core mission of liberation, and perhaps propaganda the Buddha was required to preach by the powers that be, or was introduced later by translators shocked and horrified at what True Buddhism is: an instrument for an individual to free himself from all bondage, including the many barbed yokes of society and the hypocritical, interested requirement that he should sacrifice himself for others.

My [first ever post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/5xju8h/the_first_3_noble_truths_make_perfect_sense_to_me/) mentioned that:

> For example, why should we strive for compassion (Right Resolve)?
> 
> Once you've eradicated your tanha (attachment), then by the airtight logic of the first 3 truths, you are no longer subject to dukkha (suffering). Why is it necessary - or even desirable - for you to feel compassion towards other beings?

I am surprised at how much attention Buddhism gets in the atheist community.,"I'm surprised, as well. There really isn't much overlap in the two other than the lack of teaching in a God. Buddhism is structured like many other religions: meditation centers vs. temple/church, Dalai Lama vs. pope, Pali Canon & sutras vs bible/koran. Also, being a good Buddhist and being a good Christian, for example, are not conflicting ideas.
     
Going back to the lack of teachings in God, it is quite common for Buddhists to believe in God. The reason that it's not taught is because God is an identity that can't be spoken and must be understood through experience. There are many Buddhism books today that mention some form of Heaven, God, or True Man. The book I'm reading of Chuang Tzu mentions all three of those. It mainly covers stories of Confucius, but links every story to a meditation.
     
In conclusion, I find it disheartening for others here when things are posted here that are so blatantly atheistic. You can't just tell other people that there is no God. This is the same error that anyone else makes when they evangelize through speech and not experience. Lastly, there is as much evidence against God as there is for God; it may not be a big man in the sky intent on dealing punishment and heaven may not be pearly gates on white clouds, but God's very identity is by nature un-provable.

"Met someone from a past life, now I'm not sure what to do (LONG POST)","SO last year I left LA to work on a set in Mexico as a translator for the DP. I had known getting there that I would be living there for 5 months. I was single, and willing to create a fling with someone while out there. After a few weeks of working together, we began to hang out on set during any downtime, and that soon led to us hanging out in my hotel room. 
The night he first came over my heart was pounding so hard I felt like it would burst from my chest. I only found it odd since I couldn't find a reason to feel nervous. I wasn't attached to him, I barley knew him.  
That night in the middle of sex  I experienced  a strange flash back. It threw me out of the mind state of having sex, and nearly killed the mood for me. 
I didn't make anything of it right away passing, it off as some random vision that didn't have anything to do with him. 
After a month of constantly seeing each other, whether on or off set, we realized how attached, and how addicted we became to one another. One night, I told him about the flashback from our first  night together, and he confirms that he saw it too. That he also felt that feeling of knowing me. 

Now I know I am in love. We are not together. I (22F) moved back to LA, and he (34M) stayed in Mexico. We left the title to our relationship as friends. But since I've been back I have felt myself gravitate to him, as if he was a magnet. 
I don't know if it is because i am in love, or because I don't want to let someone from another lifetime go, or am i in love with him because he is from my other lifetime?

How do Buddhists view pharmaceutical drugs and psychiatry?,"I often wonder how traditional Buddhists view professions in medicine and pharmacy, especially anything involving psychiatric treatments. Are they viewed as noble professions? Or are these people simply propagating a harmful approach to dealing with the mind? And what about the patients? Are they making a mistake by resorting to pharmaceuticals to treat mental issues?

For example, how do traditional Buddhists view things like:

‚Ä¢ People with ADHD diagnoses using powerful stimulants to improve concentration and motivation, sometimes for their entire lives

‚Ä¢ Anxious and depressed people taking things like antidepressants and benzodiazepines (‚Äúalcohol in a pill‚Äù)

‚Ä¢ Opioid addicts relying on medication-assisted treatment (usually other opioids) to live stable lives

‚Ä¢ Psychotic people taking anti-psychotics

Do Buddhists have any opinion on these things? Is the use of these drugs viewed as ‚Äúcheating‚Äù through life? Or is it all okay because it‚Äôs legal and prescribed?",Buddhism,1703532563.0,t3_18qp8en,0.59,6
I do not take refuge in the sangha,"Hasn't anyone else felt like there is no 'Sangha'? At least where I live, there is no local Buddhist community so it is not easy to find a teacher or an otherwise respected individual to learn from. It seems like every distinct modern Buddhist author has been involved in some kind of sex scandal- late in their lives, which makes me wonder if all that practice even helped them at all? The exceptions I can think of are Bikkhu Bodhi afaik, TNH who I am not particularly familiar with and Eknath Easwaran who I am also not very familiar with and is not exactly Buddhist. Others stray wildly from early Buddhist doctrine which is fine but does not resonate with me therefore not my bag, and the rest are people like Daniel Ingram (delusional). Modern monastics I've physically been in contact with are very unserious and fixated on ritual and tradition while behaving in contrast with what is described in the Nikayas... Such as playing video games, having money and cell phones, listening to music and watching tv ect, being fat from eating junk food etc. I don't understand devoting yourself to a way of life and not really devoting yourself to it? And the very serious outliers also do not seem to have acquired a lot of 'path knowledge' or whatever you'd say, their dhamma talks don't mean anything, they seem to be missing the point, I don't know what they're doing with their time, but maybe they are just poor communicators. I don't know, but why give Dhamma talks then? And it goes without saying that online communities are full of people who are Buddhist in name only and otherwise very unpleasant. 

&#x200B;

Obviously I am biased because this is my perception as an outsider but this has been a very sore point for me. Whenever I see any mention of the Sangha or the triple jewel I am disappointed. I am sure somebody relates to this. Another thing is, if you are very serious and want to 'go forth' as a woman in my part of the world you are on your own unless you've previously paid to go to some expensive Buddhist retreat in which case maybe you'll get into a community of seriously indoctrinated westerners larping as Thai monks who are vastly overestimating their 'attainments'. Overall it seems like a toxic and delusional community.

Cash Rules Everything Around Me,"(EDIT: sorry for the Wu-Tang reference, I don't mean aby disrespect.)

I'm currently thinking a lot about money. Not because I want to get rich and live in luxury, but because multiple people depend on my income.

I am grateful that I can support them financially and I also try to save some money in order to support them when their needs grow bigger due to old age or when unexpected bills have to be paid.

However, this situation is also causing me a lot of stress. I am afraid of getting so sick that I can no longer earn enough to support them. If I die in the near future, my savings will not be enough for them and not even my partner will get any type of substantial assistance because we are not married.

I feel like I have to constantly do my best in order to fulfill my obligation to them, including marrying my partner for tax reasons and for the payments they will receive when I die.

I'm well aware that I am very privileged right now. That justs adds more to the burden because I feel I need to make the most out of my privilege.

At best, gender is an act the ego performs. Sex (male / female/ intersex) is a result of our form (rupa) but it is not our self.

Why does Buddhism conflate the self and the soul?,"According to most interpretations I've seen of Anatta, there is no self in the sense of an unchanging eternal ""I"".

And therefore, at least according to most interpretations I've seen, there's no soul or atman.

But I find that there seems to be a leap in logic here; from the lack of a permanent unchanging self, to a negation of the existence of a soul.

I don't follow the logic. A theoretical soul, or permanent and unchanging essence is not, definitionally, the same as a permanent and unchanging sense or perception of self. But many Buddhists seem to take that view.

In other words, the soul and the self aren't inherently the same thing, but many Buddhists seem to define the two concepts as the same thing, and then deny them together.

"meditation as a tool, not a means","&#x200B;

This is a very abridged explanation of my thoughts on meditation. I have often relayed it to the many people who ask me about the importance of a meditative practices with regards to spiritual development.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Meditation is simply a tool, while in practice, there is innumerable ways one can do it. However, if done properly they will achieve the same goal. When talking about the mind I tend to borrow one metaphor from Sat Guru, a well-known/well-spoken Indian mystic, and who often compares the mind/intellect to a knife. Meditation, in my opinion, is the most effective method for ""sharpening your mind"", but it is only half of the solution to suffering described by the Buddha, at least that's what I believe. Many westerners are acquainted with some meditation practice, regardless of religious affiliations. Modern society is full of various things that trigger stress in people, and so we have sought to reduce it by a variety of means. For some it may be working out, riding a bike, jogging, needlework, or meditation of course. According to those schools of Buddhism based on the principles of non-duality, anything that allows you to get in the zone, so long as the point of focus is singular, can satisfy the only real requirement to be called meditative. Those schools based on the principles of duality allow for the point of focus to be singular or multiple in nature.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Getting back on topic.... Meditation being only half of the solution then what, when combined with meditation, can be considered whole or as I like to call it wholesome? The simple answer is whatever might allow you to expand the capacity of your heart, empathic compassion/loving kindness. One must train the mind and the heart in tandem, and I'm convinced the historical Buddha taught as much, hence the importance of a ""middle path"". First, I‚Äôll explain one method, although there are countless ways, of training of the mind and the heart. Afterwards I‚Äôll try to explain my thoughts regarding the potential risk, only one exist but it's rather catastrophic, should one advance to far in either one ‚Äúthe mind/the heart‚Äù while neglecting the other.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Single pointed meditation is only one of many ways to train the mind, thus sharpening the intellect ""knife"". Now the intellect, once sharpened, possesses the ability to sever one's attachments and when severing stronger attachments, the intellect need be proportionally keen. Many understand that there is a potential risk when wielding a sharp knife yet, so few understand the potential risk of wielding a sharp intellect and furthermore, unlike the knife the intellect is double edged. How easy it is, with a keen mind but a small heart, to sever any attachments that cause only one's own ego/self to experience suffering, regardless/ignorant of how it may affect others. How hard it is, when the mind is keen and heart is large, to sever any attachments that cause only one's own ego/self to experience suffering, aware of how severing it will cause others to suffer on account of your actions. My rational for this risk is simple and relates to the necessity for parental consent that the buddha placed on anyone who wanted to become a monk.  A monk is one who aspires to achieve enlightenment. As such, the first step towards monkhood, the action of joining the sangha, must be a wholly positive good deed. Anyone who left without consent of their parents to become a monk would effectively be planting their seed, the intent to become a monk, in barren soil. Such a start would be self-obstructive at the worst and unproductive at best, and not in keeping with the very thing sought by monks to begin with, enlightenment.

&#x200B;

A duality centric loving kindness meditation is one of many ways to train the heart, thus increasing one‚Äôs capacity for empathy. As empathic beings, having enlarged our hearts capacity, we possess compassionate hearts fully able to empathize with the suffering experienced by others and the more interdependent/contrived their suffering is, the heart need be proportionally deep. Many understand that there is a potential risk in having a bleeding-heart, sympathy based, yet so few understand the potential risk in having a feeling-heart, empathy based, and furthermore, unlike the bleeding-heart a feeling-heart is double edged. How easy it is, with a heart‚Äôs capacity enlarged but a dull mind, to get overburdened/crushed as you attempt to help relieve the suffering of others, you take part of their suffering and make it you‚Äôre suffering. You will eventually lose sight of/forget what your burden, the cause of your own suffering, was to begin with. How hard it is, When the mind is keen and the heart is having a deep capacity, to get overburdened/crushed as you attempt to help relieve the suffering of others. You first sought  to become unburdened without burdening another, only then did you attempt to relieve others of their own suffering. Because of this unburdened position any subsequent actions, like taking part of others suffering and making it you‚Äôre suffering,  may be understood as unconditioned/without cause. Just like a lotus rooted in muck breaks free to bloom above the muddied waters, only those unconditioned acts that occur without cause, without cause should be understood to be cause itself here, and whose effect produces a fruit favorable to enlightenment. My rational for this risk is not simple and relates to my own understanding of the Buddha‚Äôs teachings.

&#x200B;

Simply put, while attempting to find relief a heartless mind will easily burdens others, knowingly or unknowingly. Such a heartless practices may relieve stress in this lifetime, but  is likely to have a negative impact, resulting in an even greater burden during your lifetime .    On the other hand, while great is the reward for one who is sincere and heartfelt while helping to relieve others, mindless one must not be. Just as there is no harvest for the farmer who waters another‚Äôs crop, and not his own, likewise there is no virtue in aiding others with their duties if your own duties go neglected.",Buddhism,1629721751.0,t3_p9ytjh,0.5,0

Just thought I'd copy paste this here.

&#x200B;

""Those objects that we desire so much will lose their appeal over time. Sense pleasures, sexual or otherwise, are short-lived. Even if one can have access to sense pleasures, the ABILITY to enjoy them¬† WILL decrease with time. That is something that people typically do not realize""

""The attitude of most people is, ‚ÄúI need to enjoy them to the fullest while I can.‚Äù But one needs to stay away from extreme behaviors at least. Learning Dhamma will help to avoid **future suffering; one must start as soon as possible**. When we get old, we lose not only the ability to enjoy such pleasures but also the ability to comprehend Dhamma (because our brains degrade with time)""

tldr; Start now! when we get old, we lose not only the ability to enjoy such pleasures but also the ability to comprehend Dhamma (because our brains degrade with time)

Lotus tattoo,"Hi, 

So I am getting a tattoo this week. I practice Buddhism and I‚Äôm a very spiritual person, so keep in mind I‚Äôm not getting this because I think it looks ‚Äúcool‚Äù or ‚Äútrendy.‚Äù I was planning on getting a lotus tattoo on my thigh‚Ä¶ but I just learned that lotus tattoos, especially below the waist, are seen as impure and can be very offensive to people. I am Caucasian, so to some who see the tattoo who don‚Äôt know me may be offended.. but I practice Buddhism. I don‚Äôt know if this makes a difference. There‚Äôs another part to the tattoo, I could simply ask to remove the lotus flower from the piece.. to me the lotus represents growth, strength, and new beginnings. But I can have it taken out, I still have time. I just wanted to get everyone‚Äôs opinions on it. Is this cultural appropriation and offensive? What about the placement? Etc. I just want to do the right thing. Please feel free to add in whatever you‚Äôd like, I‚Äôd like to learn more so I can avoid making mistakes in the future.

You're not '(pure) awareness',"I've seen this idea floated around in Buddhist circles before.

The following premises I want to share are simple. I would love to be refuted, just like the rest of us.

Step away from the body and all of its sensations and perceptions. All you are left with is mind.

Step away from the mind and all of its forms (thoughts and emotions). What are you left with?

Here a lot of people naively make the mistake (as I did many times in the past) of thinking 'pure, non-judgmental/preferential awareness!'.

Here's why that's wrong. Your awareness can not exist in a vacuum (your mind is a mirror as zen folks say). You're only ever aware **of** things. Aware **of** things through your **senses** (and cognition).

Shed your senses. Shed your cognition. Nothing remains to be aware **of**, nothing remains to be aware **with**.

Forget no-self, all that's left is no-being. Gives a whole new perspective on the Buddhist idea of emptiness.

Implication: Good old Gautama doesn't exist. Just like you don't exist after you die.

It is a Mahayana Sutra.

>Candapradyota: O brahmin, if there should happen to be a war, how does a perfectly righteous ruler deal with it?  
Satyavadin: Your majesty, he should deal with it by applying three types of skillful means during each one of the three different periods. These three periods are the beginning, middle, and end.  
At the beginning, if a ruler or minister can act as a friendly mediator and settle a dispute, a ruler should apply skillful means and thereby prevent war. If a ruler can placate his opponents and settle a dispute, he should do so and thereby prevent war. If a ruler can show that he has formed an alliance and has threatened the enemy with many more opponents, and in this way can succeed in preventing war, then he should form such an alliance, make threats, and thereby prevent war. In such ways a ruler should apply skillful means at the beginning. If a righteous ruler can not succeed in preventing war, whether by means of friendly mediation, benefitting his enemy, or issuing warnings, then he should wage war, keeping three thoughts in mind.  
Candapradyota: What are these three? As a righteous ruler, do I not cause people to fall into deplorable conditions and do I not neglect the method stopping people from falling into deplorable conditions?  
Satyavadin: First, a ruler must keep protection of the people in mind; second, a ruler must keep victory over the enemy in mind; amd third, a ruler must keep protection of all life in mind. Having these three thoughts in mind, a ruler then can summon the four corps of his armed forces. A ruler should apply skillful means in this way during the middle.  
During the final time, a ruler should arrange the four corps according to inferior, medium-grade, and superior soldiers. Inferior warriors should be arranged at the front line with medium-grade warriors behind them, and the calvary should extend behind these two. The ruler along with the superior warriors should remain at the rear. This arrangement will fulfill the ruler‚Äôs intention, bring good results, and allow the brave together with the cowardly soldiers to show gratitude, using whatever abilities they have, to fight with courage and also to fight fear; thus they will not be turned back. A ruler should apply his skillful means in this way during the final period.  
Although in war, injury and death may be inflicted on the opposing army, a ruler by his skillful means will commit less unspeakable and less nonvirtuous action and may not necessarily experience retribution, since he undertook such measures with heedfulness and compassion.  
Because he undertakes these measures for the protection of the people and for the sake of their families, wives, and children without concern for himself or his property and possessions, he greatly will increase his immeasurable merit. Your Majesty, if there is to be war, then a righteous ruler should consider it in this way.",Buddhism,1550820033.0,t3_atekdt,0.5,0

Marijuana?,"Wondering what your opinions are on this substance, how you feel about its usefulness/hindrance. Personally, I have facilitated a lot of skillful change in my own life, while using marijuana fairly frequently. Of course, this is completely subjective and I have no way to truly know how much/if the pot catalyzed any change, if it hindered me from being even better, or if it had nothing to do with any of it...

I have heard that marijuana has been a large part of Indian culture dating back even before the Buddha, and wonder if anyone knows any more pertinent history on it.

Universe is disorder.

Reality.

Cannot fool an ego.

Cannot fool that which does not exist. 

Cannot lose it like this. 

Did you find it now?

Are you satisfied?

There is no failure or successes because its all based on the egos perception. 

Love wraps outside of the ego.

Compassion copes with outer beings.

Because these tread outside, they lead to liberation.

Liberating the self from the self. 

Or no self?

Is the only way no self?

What **is** no self?

Only way to find is meditation or psychedelics.

No easy way out.

Yet we're looking down the wrong path. 

Spinning the wheels.

Nor does it stick as consciousness is ever changing.

Yet usually grounded by the ego.

We came here to find nothing,

Which was exactly what we needed to find.

Who is we?

The voices inside this head.

The controllers?

The ego.

The ego is trying to cure itself.

The ego is trying to eliminate itself by using itself.

The flame burns to put itself out.

This is a contradiction.

This is the spinning wheel.

From the person who's had it with the Hindi loan words... I've had it with the Obscurantists.,"I came across a great word the other day, ""obscurantist.""  It is a person who falls back on esoteric knowledge in order to appear smarter than the person they are challenging.  It is a powerful technique for small-minded people full of rote knowledge earned through tedious learning to overcome whoever it is they want to challenge.

Buddhism is full of Obscurantists.  They quote various esoteric sutras and claim that Buddha did or did not say one thing or another.  The greatest of all Obscurantists of course is the Pope and the Vatican he controls.  They employ a global army of professional Obscurantists -- priests -- who hold the final word on everything by reference to esoteric scripture.

The great strength of Buddhism is that deeply embedded in its teaching is a disdain for mere words, a refusal to be embodied by any particular text or saying.  It is first and foremost an experience that we are to have for ourselves, not knowledge and subservience to texts as a source of commands we ought follow.  Thus Buddhism is better able to resist the small-mindedness of Obscurantists better than the Judaic religions which fixed meaning within the text rather than fixing the text to point to meaning.

Reject Obscurantism.  Don't get pulled into debates over what Buddha did or didn't say, nobody really knows unless they were there.  Discern the principles and the Dharma, seek the experience of ego dissolution and nibbana, but don't get caught up in reading every sutra so you can win over the small-minded Obscurantists.",Buddhism,1341088914.0,t3_vurpe,0.47,0

Drop a bit the jargon from time to time,"Hey reddit, 

just posting an invitation to drop a bit some words that are particular to Buddhist translations and Buddhist original languages because it can be confusing for people new to Buddhism, and, if you say ""well, don't hold on emotionally to something"" and you say ""don't get attached to it"" it more or less conveys the same meaning, but one requires a deeper explanation and the other one is quite easy to understand and is less misleading. After saying something mundane you can complement it with something like ""this is called being detached"", for general knowledge's and further study's sake.


Try from time to time expressing things in your words (I would invite you to always try to use polite words, not aggressive), and try to do it in a concise speech, as short or as long as it's needed to be, no more no less. Altho, more often than not, some explanations get longer than needed. Some others get so short they can be misleading also.

Mind that other people don't have the responsibility to understand you. Nor you have the responsibility to make them understand... But let's just try to follow a centered path.

When becoming a teacher one stops saying his teacher's words and start talking it like it's your own knowledge (even tho it was from no one to begin with).

Also mind that what you are reading in most cases (with sutras and stuff) are translations, and some translators don't always find exact words to describe what's being translated, and sutras are no exception. So it might be better if you don't take words that seriously. Just enough to keep consistency and integrity.

The words don't make the teaching. The teaching makes the words.

So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near PƒÅvƒÅ in Cunda the smith‚Äôs mango grove. Then Cunda the smith went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, ‚ÄúCunda, whose purity do you believe in?‚Äù

‚ÄúSir, I believe in the purity advocated by the western brahmins draped with moss who carry pitchers, serve the sacred flame, and immerse themselves in water.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut Cunda, what kind of purity do these western brahmins advocate?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe western brahmins encourage their disciples like this: ‚ÄòPlease, good people, rising early you should stroke the earth from your bed. If you don‚Äôt stroke the earth, stroke fresh cow dung. If you don‚Äôt stroke fresh cow dung, stroke green grass. If you don‚Äôt stroke green grass, serve the sacred flame. If you don‚Äôt serve the sacred flame, revere the sun with joined palms. If you don‚Äôt revere the sun with joined palms, immerse yourself in water three times, including the evening.‚Äô The western brahmins advocate this kind of purity.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe purity advocated by the western brahmins is quite different from that in the training of the Noble One.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut what, Master Gotama, is purity in the training of the Noble One? Master Gotama, please teach me this.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell then, brahmin, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù Cunda replied. The Buddha said this:

‚ÄúCunda, impurity is threefold by way of body, fourfold by way of speech, and threefold by way of mind.

And how is impurity threefold by way of body? It‚Äôs when a certain person kills living creatures. They‚Äôre violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings. 

They steal. With the intention to commit theft, they take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness. 

They commit sexual misconduct. They have sexual relations with women who have their mother, father, both mother and father, brother, sister, relatives, or clan as guardian. They have sexual relations with a woman who is protected on principle, or who has a husband, or whose violation is punishable by law, or even one who has been garlanded as a token of betrothal. 

This is the threefold impurity by way of body.

And how is impurity fourfold by way of speech? It‚Äôs when a certain person lies. They‚Äôre summoned to a council, an assembly, a family meeting, a guild, or to the royal court, and asked to bear witness: ‚ÄòPlease, mister, say what you know.‚Äô Not knowing, they say ‚ÄòI know.‚Äô Knowing, they say ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know.‚Äô Not seeing, they say ‚ÄòI see.‚Äô And seeing, they say ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt see.‚Äô So they deliberately lie for the sake of themselves or another, or for some trivial worldly reason. 

They speak divisively. They repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. And so they divide those who are harmonious, supporting division, delighting in division, loving division, speaking words that promote division. 

They speak harshly. They use the kinds of words that are cruel, nasty, hurtful, offensive, bordering on anger, not leading to immersion. 

They talk nonsense. Their speech is untimely, and is neither factual nor beneficial. It has nothing to do with the teaching or the training. Their words have no value, and are untimely, unreasonable, rambling, and pointless. This is the fourfold impurity by way of speech. 

And how is impurity threefold by way of mind? It‚Äôs when a certain person is covetous. They covet the wealth and belongings of others: ‚ÄòOh, if only their belongings were mine!‚Äô 

They have ill will and malicious intentions: ‚ÄòMay these sentient beings be killed, slaughtered, slain, destroyed, or annihilated!‚Äô 

They have wrong view. Their perspective is distorted: ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There‚Äôs no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There‚Äôs no afterlife. There‚Äôs no such thing as mother and father, or beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there‚Äôs no ascetic or brahmin who is rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.‚Äô This is the threefold impurity by way of mind. 

These are the ten ways of doing unskillful deeds. When you have these ten ways of doing unskillful deeds, then if you rise early, whether or not you stroke the earth from your bed, you‚Äôre still impure.

Whether or not you stroke fresh cow dung, you‚Äôre still impure.

Whether or not you stroke green grass, you‚Äôre still impure.

Whether or not you serve the sacred flame, you‚Äôre still impure.

Whether or not you revere the sun with joined palms, you‚Äôre still impure.

Whether or not you immerse yourself in water three times, you‚Äôre still impure. Why is that? These ten ways of doing unskillful deeds are impure and make things impure.

It‚Äôs because of those who do these ten kinds of unskillful deeds that hell, the animal realm, the ghost realm, or any other bad places are found.

Cunda, purity is threefold by way of body, fourfold by way of speech, and threefold by way of mind.

And how is purity threefold by way of body? It‚Äôs when a certain person gives up killing living creatures. They renounce the rod and the sword. They‚Äôre scrupulous and kind, living full of compassion for all living beings. 

They give up stealing. They don‚Äôt, with the intention to commit theft, take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness. 

They give up sexual misconduct. They don‚Äôt have sexual relations with women who have their mother, father, both mother and father, brother, sister, relatives, or clan as guardian. They don‚Äôt have sexual relations with a woman who is protected on principle, or who has a husband, or whose violation is punishable by law, or even one who has been garlanded as a token of betrothal. 

This is the threefold purity by way of body.

And how is purity fourfold by way of speech? It‚Äôs when a certain person gives up lying. They‚Äôre summoned to a council, an assembly, a family meeting, a guild, or to the royal court, and asked to bear witness: ‚ÄòPlease, mister, say what you know.‚Äô Not knowing, they say ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know.‚Äô Knowing, they say ‚ÄòI know.‚Äô Not seeing, they say ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt see.‚Äô And seeing, they say ‚ÄòI see.‚Äô So they don‚Äôt deliberately lie for the sake of themselves or another, or for some trivial worldly reason. 

They give up divisive speech. They don‚Äôt repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, they reconcile those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony. 

They give up harsh speech. They speak in a way that‚Äôs mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable and agreeable to the people. 

They give up talking nonsense. Their words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. They say things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial. 

This is the fourfold purity by way of speech.

And how is purity threefold by way of mind? It‚Äôs when a certain person is content. They don‚Äôt covet the wealth and belongings of others: ‚ÄòOh, if only their belongings were mine!‚Äô 

They have a kind heart and loving intentions: ‚ÄòMay these sentient beings live free of enmity and ill will, untroubled and happy!‚Äô 

They have right view, an undistorted perspective: ‚ÄòThere is meaning in giving, sacrifice, and offerings. There are fruits and results of good and bad deeds. There is an afterlife. There are such things as mother and father, and beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there are ascetics and brahmins who are rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who describe the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.‚Äô 

This is the threefold purity by way of mind.

These are the ten ways of doing skillful deeds. When you have these ten ways of doing skillful deeds, then if you rise early, whether or not you stroke the earth from your bed, you‚Äôre still pure.

Whether or not you stroke fresh cow dung, you‚Äôre still pure.

Whether or not you revere the sun with joined palms, you‚Äôre still pure.

Whether or not you immerse yourself in water three times, you‚Äôre still pure. Why is that? These ten ways of doing skillful deeds are pure and make things pure.

It‚Äôs because of those who do these ten kinds of skillful deeds that gods, humans, or any other good places are found.‚Äù

When he said this, Cunda the smith said to the Buddha, ‚ÄúExcellent, sir! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what‚Äôs there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.‚Äù

"An Issue With Western ""Buddhism""","Or rather, with the practices of most Westerners.

&nbsp;

I've noticed a trend, or rather just started paying attention to a trend, of people wishing to be ""Buddhist"", without being Buddhist. That is, without all the ""woo woo"" and superstition/faith(Depending on your outlook/vocab).

&nbsp;

People asking, ""What's the point of karma and rebirth, if you can't prove it?"", or for Buddhist teachers/lineages that lack belief in the Six Realms, Nirvana, or Devas/Hungry ghosts. That would be equivalent to asking if there are any Christian denominations where they don't believe Christ is Lord, or Islam without respect to Muhammed(PBUH). You can't ""pick and choose"" Buddhism and the supernatural, like some Belief Buffet. If you're looking for a way to calm your mind without the supernatural, meditation is fine, but so is CBT. Wish to be a better person? Like Nike, just do it, you don't need Buddhism as some sort of ""exotic"" rationale for not being a dick.(Yes, I know ""Secular Buddhism"" is a thing, along with ""Secular Christianity."" I think that strips them both of their true meaning.)

&nbsp;

Long story short: It's fine to have doubts about your faith. Even the Buddha said not to believe him sight unseen, but to try and experience it for yourself. But pretending that Buddhism, stripped of it's faith and teachings of things supernatural, is still Buddhism, is flawed Incorrect Speech.

Is the soul doesn't exist how do past lives work?,"I'm new to this sub so go easy on me.

His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama according to Tibetan Buddhist teaching is the 14th reincarnation of the same being, retaining enough semblance of his past lives to recall his previous memories and confirm himself upon re-entry into this physical state as the next Dalai Lama in the succession.

If the Dalai Lama is a manifestation of the Buddha of Compassion ""choosing"" to reincarnate to assist humanity, what is ""choosing"" to come back if after Nirvana one is liberated from existence in all forms? If the ""soul"" does not exist and consciousness ceases after enlightenment what exactly is coming back?

Some tell me that achieving Nirvana means the end of the deluded state of self, like a flame going out. Consciousness ceases to exist. It is the end of samsara. This is the distinction from Hinduism that teaches a supreme reality, united consciousness. Others say that achieving Nirvana creates an unbinding from this conditioned reality, but a transition to a limitless consciousness outside the physical.

And before that, there were articles on the Theravada council to not let women to become Bhukkini. Ajahn Brahm has already been excommunicated because he ordained four women and refused the councils demand to openly dismiss the ordination of the Bhukkini.

Does Buddhism have a 'race problem' in your view? Why or why not?,"Just curious. I'm involved with a non-profit that started with COVID relief and is now moving into helping Black dharma teachers. They want to raise several million dollars to give $500 a month to support Black dharma teachers. Not against this, just stating the context of why I'm curious.

I've done some research of my own and found majority of the Buddhists in America live in California and Hawaii. A friend of mine who is very familiar with this issue tells me there are some Buddhist groups that only allow Black Buddhists and no one else, many times they have trouble gaining membership and staying afloat financially.

I grew up in Atlanta, so I am well aware of the racial tensions in America and have seen many of the underlying causes around me growing up. I have never seen anyone turned away from a Buddhist center though, regardless of color, gender, sexual orientation, or political views. The vibe in the centers I frequented was about moving beyond self-grasping to reach the Other Shore.

What I do see happening is politics is beginning to become a part of an institution that, to me, has aimed to be the end of religion, politics, business-as-usual. I see identity politics creating moral crusades that cause further division at a time when we could focus on unifying causes like regenerative agriculture (a solution for world health, climate change, sustainable development).

This is what I think at least. I could be misguided or misled, I'm only 31 after all. So, please speak freely because I'd love to hear from as many points of view as possible. I genuinely want to understand and if I can, be of service.

The Middle Way of Abortion,"> In America, pro-life and pro-choice voices are pitted against each other with some on both sides denying the complexity of the issue. Jennifer Keishin Armstrong reports on how Buddhist teachings could transform the abortion debate‚Äîand benefit women.

Even though it might be controversial, I thought this article was worth reading. It presents some reflections that could be considered nuanced on abortion, and also talks about ""mizuko kuyo"", a Japanese ceremony for ""abortion, miscarriage, stillbirth, or sudden infant death"".

The title of the article feels a bit misleading, or like click-bait or sensationalist, and I thought of not using it for the title of the post, but then I thought it might be more transparent to simply leave it as it is.

My friends are buying guns because of this and they suggest that I get one as well, I've always declined though because the last thing I want to do is end a human life even if it's in self defense.

I wonder now whether I'm just not seeing the forest from the trees. My thinking now is that if I didn't defend myself and ended up killed then wouldn't it have been unskillful of me to die like that? I have people who love me and need me in their lives, if I didn't defend myself in the face of fatal violence and l end up dead than what use is that to anyone?

Dealing with Demonic Influences,"Edit: please read it all before downvoting or upvoting. This post is not as mystical as you think it is.

A demonic influence or state is considered to be so when we can't trace well the cause of our delusion or suffering to any particular cause; it's rooted in falseness and thus it's void and non-real, yet it affect us deeply.

Most demonic influence happen because of the following:

- Thinking falsely that you are enlightened, that you are a sage, or confusing a small achievement, vision, revelation, or a ""deep"" or impressive experience with full enlightenment.

- Being conceited and taking huge pride in one self and your capacities, ideas or actions, distancing yourself from others and seeing your achievements as unreachable by others; disregarding other's achievements and not recognising your own mistakes but seeing as huge other's mistakes.

- Feeling fear of demons, ghosts, darkness, spirits, monsters or any supernatural or natural beings or powers outside of our control. Fear of judgment, of making mistakes, of not being loved, of being lonely, of losing someone, etc. **Any kind of fear is in itself a demonic influence in every single case**, it is the most common and root demonic influence of them all. Under every single demonic influence there's a very well covered feeling of fear underneath.

- Indulging in unwholesome actions or thinking you are indulging in unwholesome actions and fearing retribution for them (wether we really did something bad or not).

- Indulging into duality and discursive thoughts excessively (she loves me she doesn't, I love him I hate him, I don't know if that was right or wrong, etc.) and going from one side of the coin to the other, and also thinking you are indulging into duality.

- Indulging into greed, lust or anger or thinking you are indulging into greed, lust or anger.

Demonic states are banished easily if the person recognises them as such, empty, non-existent, and not real phenomena. Just like a lie is a non-existent phenomena.

Demonic states completely rely on our mind to exist. If our mind stops feeding, they die on their own. Just like lies die if no one believes them. The same with nightmares and fears.

When our restlessness, emotional unbalance, emotional burst, unease, hardship or delusion can't be traced to anywhere in ourselves, our memories or our ideas with vipassana or with any other meditation; the most probable cause is that we are under demonic influence and like previously told, you need only to recognise such event as false, empty and non-existent for it to perish and be gone.

Fear is very elusive and tricky as all demonic states. We might feel fear of feeling fear for example. So we must be careful and smart. It takes experience to snap out of demonic influences and more to not get caught in the as they are very very subtle.

Fear of being conceited is also fear. Fear of indulging into unwholesome actions is also fear. Fear of fear is also fear. Etc. Thinking excessively of what is fear and what is not also brings a demonic influence.

If fear persists and you can't end it without just recognising it as void then you should meditate upon this: Your fear, your pain and you are all void. Void can't harm void. Emptiness can't harm emptiness. The pain is void, you are void.

I have a bone to pick with Buddhism.,"I fell into it during my formative years. At 14-15 years of age I read and agreed that wants cause suffering, about staying detached from everything - especially your own self, and everything else about passivity and escapism that Buddhism teaches. (To the Buddhist view this isn't escapism, this is growing inwards.) I actively curbed my wants and restricted my thoughts. Now I see the damage this worldview has caused me.


Buddhism works on people who indulged in their lives and at some point grew weary of it, or suffered an incident of loss and wanted to withdraw, or couldn't cope with the world in general. Such a mind seeks escape from reality, and to them, the concept of 'refuge' appeals like a garden of serenity to withdraw from the world. (I'm referring to the Earth, its constituents, and time as 'real'.)


It definitely does not work the other way: if your mind already shaped as a Buddhist to forego wants and rationalize passive suffering and is content with what's around you even though you may be burning in hell, you do not want to participate in the world anymore. You've already withdrawn, and it's turned your mind into a ghost. You're in self doubt because ego is vanity and loving yourself is selfish and vain. Then you suffer a catatonic state of having nothing to do, nowhere to go, nothing to achieve or work towards. You're never able to experience happiness because someone said, all happiness is fleeting, and all pursuit of it futile. You've already died, just that the body will continue to live on for another fifty years. Enjoy!


People my age are doing it all, the full experience. And I don't want to deep down, there's no desire, and there's no sense of self actualization, everything is suffering. Until recently, I was thinking it was them in the wrong for believing that that is happiness. How braindead have I become.


I'm not blaming anything. I'm not looking to understand my thoughts anymore. It's only that I now feel out of place in the world, and I think I made a connection why. I think I wired the wrong ideology into my brain, missed out on growing a lot as a 'real person' by developing the wrong perspective, and I'm in incredible psychological pain and confusion. I now need refuge from myself. (By 'real' I still mean belonging to the physical world, not some metaphysical ideal that exists in the _spirit within_.)


I don't intend to offend, but I'll raise that Buddhism teaches surrender, passivity, giving up, withdrawal, denial and escapism from physical reality and can have very damaging consequences on the individual's experience with life. It's accepting the hell around you and taking the easy way out.

"How the movie ""Sausage Party"" reveals the nature of reality and the path to enlightenment.","**Warning: Spoilers ahead.

Also, some concepts of this post will not be directly related to Buddhism. I will be using the term ""Archons"", however perhaps there is a better Buddhist term, maybe demons.** 


Sausage Party is about a the lives of food in a supermarket. They all are happy because they have an idea about their world and the afterlife. They see humans as gods that hold their fate, and carry them beyond the doors where they believe heaven awaits them. One of them ends up being returned and is full of fear because he realized that the afterlife is actually not as he thought it was. He tries to speak out but is seen as crazy.


Another thing to mention is the relationship these characters have with each other. Many of them dislike each other, upset that they share the same aisles, Sauerkraut wishing to exterminate Juice, etc.


Because of their delusions about heaven (or life after death), many of them believe they should act a certain way and avoid certain acts like homosexuality and sex because the gods are always watching.


At one point some of the produce are bought and they are awaiting heaven and realize the gods are actually evil entities that use them for energy. In the movie it even says how they eat children, how their hunger is insatiable, and that the people created them for their own benefit.


*This is an extremely accurate portrayal of what Archons do. They are entities that control our reality and feed off our energy and fear for their own insatiable appetites. At the time of death, they await at the light to coax us in, claiming it is the entrance into heaven, but it is actually a trick to make us come back to this reality so they can continue using us and feed on our energy.*


In the movie, when the characters are faced with the truth, they first deny it. They would rather rest in their happy ideas about the world even though it doesn't face or fix the problem.


**This idea represents the first characteristic of our reality, that suffering exists because we are pretty much completely off the radar on what reality is. Many people aren't willing to take this first step because it conflicts with everything they've ever known and been comforted by.**


It only took a few minutes from this point of denial before the produce were faced with the tough truth by seeing it for themselves. They felt hopeless, but quickly realized if they work together they can defeat the ""gods"".


*This is exactly what the cabal, or so called ""gods"" of our reality don't want us to realize, that if we saw how the problems we attach to one another are unimportant and false, that we might wake up to see who the real enemies are, them! Together, we have enough energy to defeat them.*


After the produce defeats the ""gods"", they have the supermarket to themselves, and humorously partake in a superfluous amount of pleasurable acts with each other, seeing that heaven, or enlightenment, was there the whole time.


**The second characteristic of reality this movie represents is also quite clear at this point if you look for it, though they never specifically mention it... impermanence. We are dealing with a movie about produce. Even when they come to understand the reality of the gods, they have not yet faced their own mortality. They believe they've reached enlightenment at this point, partaking in pleasure and happiness but have not yet faced the nature of their existence. Humans face the same issue, since we are expiring every day and don't often check in with this or practice accepting death, we may live a very happy life but be faced with fear when it is time to leave it. With every ounce of our being wanting to come back to existence, we are more than compliant to enter the light. Archons will also show images of loved ones and use our emotional attachments to people to make us return.**


But of course that's not the end, there is a plot twist, much like in our reality, there is more to the story. After tripping, some of the characters realize that all of existence is an illusion, how they are all characters in a movie actually created by even grander beings in another dimension (Collective Consciousness). They realize that their voices, ideas, opinions, etc. are all part of something beyond themselves. They create a machine that will take them out of the illusion, holding hands as they walk in to the wormhole together. As they do this, the screen warps in on itself and that is the end of the movie.


**This idea represents the other two aspects of our reality, emptiness and non-self. Emptiness because nothing in our reality has a purpose, it just is. We are comprised of molecules and we choose to give it meaning, but if we truly look, we can see that it simply doesn't exist, at least not in the way we perceive it in our day to day lives. Non-self is represented here because the produce become aware of the fact that the choices they make and even their voices aren't ""them"". It is some higher consciousness working together that brings them their life and experience.**


*In the end, they are willing and fearless about their fates as they enter the wormhole. They see how beautiful life is just being life and experiencing it. That is ultimately what enlightenment is and what every being wishes to find.*",Buddhism,1494042345.0,t3_69j9a9,0.6,6

IamA - Enlightened Person,"I have become enlightened due to diligent meditation following teachings in the traditions of Theravada and Tibetan Buddhism. As such, my greatest wish is to see the enlightenment of my fellow human beings. I am doing this AMA in order to open people's eyes to the fact that enlightenment does indeed exist, as well as to clarify misconceptions surrounding it.

For the sake of clarity I will define Enlightenment here; it is completely overcoming duality, or the sense of being separate from experience. Thus enlightenment is the experience of union with what different tradition have described as the nature of reality, or God, or emptiness, or so on.  It is fully being right in the present with absolutely no question to the contrary.

"Some of your ancestors and deceased loved ones may have been reborn as hungry ghosts, no longer able to fend for themselves. In this poem the Buddha explains that it is to your long-term benefit ‚Äî and to theirs ‚Äî that you honor their memory with gifts.","    Outside the walls they stand,
	    & at crossroads.
    At door posts they stand,
 	    returning to their old homes.
    But when a meal with plentiful food & drink is served,
	    no one remembers them:
    Such is the kamma of living beings.

    Thus those who feel sympathy for their dead relatives
    give timely donations of proper food & drink
	    ‚Äî exquisite, clean ‚Äî
    [thinking:] ""May this be for our relatives.
		    May our relatives be happy!""

    And those who have gathered there,
	    the assembled shades of the relatives,
    with appreciation give their blessing
    for the plentiful food & drink:
	    ""May our relatives live long
	    because of whom we have gained [this gift].
	    We have been honored,
	    and the donors are not without reward!""

    For there [in their realm] there's
	    no farming,
	    no herding of cattle,
	    no commerce,
	    no trading with money.
    They live on what is given here,
	    hungry shades
	    whose time here is done.

    As water raining on a hill
    flows down to the valley,
	    even so does what is given here
	    benefit the dead.
    As rivers full of water
    fill the ocean full,
	    even so does what is given here
	    benefit the dead.

    ""He gave to me, she acted on my behalf,
	    they were my relatives, companions, friends"":
    Offerings should be given for the dead
    when one reflects thus
    on things done in the past.
    For no weeping,
	    no sorrowing
	    no other lamentation
		    benefits the dead
		    whose relatives persist in that way.
    But when this offering is given, well-placed in the Sangha,
    it works for their long-term benefit
    and they profit immediately.

    In this way 
		    the proper duty to relatives has been shown,
		    great honor has been done to the dead,
		    and monks have been given strength:

	    The merit you've acquired
		    isn't small.

Why are humans so special?,"So much of Buddhism does seem to elevate humanity above the other animals and states of existence. It seems to me that we have a lot of territorial genetic baggage, as well as the ever growing heap of society's baggage, and a very counter-intuitive reptilian brain at the basis of our genetic upbringing. What about the other animals that might evolve intelligence in the next 100,000 years? What if they have less territorial hangups? Are they still somehow not good enough to make the cut? Dogs seem to encapsulate mindfulness, compassion, and being in the moment, and get over emotional baggage much more readily. Why aren't there dog buddhas? Is it because we can't understand their words? Isn't that hanging too much attachment on words, which we typically agree, severely limit our ability to communicate, and pedantics can take our words and ignore our meaning?

On what rational basis can one believe in Amitabha?,"There is a rational argument to be made for the salvific power of Jesus' death on the cross, which goes roughly as follows:

1. The Gospels are basically accurate historical documents. 
2. Therefore, there is good historical evidence that Jesus died on the cross and afterward appeared  and spoke to to his disciples. 
3. The best logical explanation for this is that God raised him from the dead, and he was who he claimed to be. 

Obviously this argument is not a slam dunk, or everyone would be Christian. (Personally I don't find it convincing.) But it is basically logically sound. Scholars generally agree that the Gospels are, to a greater or lesser extent, an accurate representation of what the historical Jesus did and said. There's no *a priori* reason to discount everything miraculous in them without begging the question. ""If Jesus really did miraculously cure the sick and blind, walk and water, and rise from the dead, we may reasonably conclude that he was telling the truth about being divine"" is a logically sound statement that I agree with. 

To rationally believe in Amitabha, surely we have to believe not only that the historical Buddha did have the supernormal abilities and knowledge that he claimed to have, but also that the Pure Land sutras are an accurate record of his teachings. In my opinion, the following syllogism, if true, would be of comparable strength to the Christian apologetic syllogism given above:

1. The Pure Land sutras more or less accurately reproduce actual teachings given by the historical Buddha. 
2. The historical Buddha was a philosophical genius and morally unimpeachable; what's more, there are many eyewitness accounts of his supernormal abilities and knowledge. 
3. Therefore we can conclude he was not lying and Amitabha exists.

But unlike the Gospels, whose historical accuracy is disputed in scholarly circles mostly as a matter of degree, the Pure Land sutras are generally considered by scholars *not* to be authentic records of what the historical Buddha taught. As far as I can tell, to claim otherwise, we need to argue that... 

1. Some of the Buddha's most powerful, memorable, and popularly accessible teachings were unknown to, or not transmitted by, a large community of his followers, for some unknown reason; or,
2. They were known to his disciples but not written down until far after most of his other teachings (and then written down in a very different literary style), again for an unknown reason; or,
3. They were secreted away after the Buddha's death in some miraculous manner before being revealed again later.

Unlike the Christian apologetic syllogism described above, *all* of these options, as far as I know, require some degree of blind faith; that is, none of them have *any* rational historical claim to truth; and all of them carry the distinct scent of retconning. 

And if we accept the opinion of most(all?) scholars that the Pure Land sutras weren't actually taught by the historical Buddha, we're in an even more awkward position of having to take on faith the words of an anonymous author who was lying about where he got his information.

So... what am I missing? Am I thinking about this the wrong way? 

I realize this comes across as an attack on your belief system, but I want to emphasize that I am actually *asking a question;* I know lots of Pure Land Buddhists are smart and educated, and I want to know how they justify their faith to themselves.",Buddhism,1666203604.0,t3_y8a32a,0.59,7

Think I may have experienced ego dissolution,"I‚Äôm an 18 year old female, and last night was very strange. It all started from a friend who i have been in love with for over a year, i have never told him how I felt, last night he said ‚ÄúI love you (platonically), this is nothing unusual, he says this occasionally and I tell him I love him too. But it hurt me at first, because I know he will never see me as something more. But this led to a confusing array of questions, i cant remember much from last night specifically, except I remember feeling bad and eventually calling out to something spiritually within the universe to guide me to gain a clearer answer. The next day I woke up expecting to feel completely normal as I usually do, but I didn‚Äôt. I haven‚Äôt felt like myself all day, and I was so cripplingly aware of who I‚Äôve been in my past, how my friendship with this person was just a mirror of my bad childhood that I was subconsciously seeking out, and I immediately felt no attachment to him anymore, I still love him as a friend and we‚Äôre still friends obviously, but it was like all that pressure and my behaviour and how it negatively manifested in my friendship with him had just gone. I couldn‚Äôt feel a connection to my past identity and still can‚Äôt really, like I woke up an entirely new person. I became aware that although introspection is a good thing, I have been almost unhealthily obsessed with it, which was actually bringing me more misunderstanding than understanding. I have been questioning everything; am/was I just a performance for everybody? Is this really me?. I thought I was experiencing some symptom of a mental disorder before I realised that this feeling feels strangely similar to an ego dissolution i experienced on psychedelics a couple of years ago, although nothing about me changed after I had come down from the drugs. So then I started to look into the Buddhist side of ego dissolution (I have only been Buddhist for a few months), and realised that I‚Äôm pretty sure this is what I‚Äôm feeling. I have been practicing yoga and occasional meditation for the past few months, I would do yoga anyway before I became Buddhist but I‚Äôve been doing it more frequently since I found myself aligning with Buddhist beliefs. I‚Äôve been listening to sound baths, burning incense and I have a few crystals too that I use in different scenarios. I just really didn‚Äôt expect to feel ego dissolution this quickly, although I am seeing it as my opportunity to live in the real world and do good with my actions. I almost don‚Äôt even want to think about who I was before, I just want to live. But my question is, what do i do now? Since feeling like this, I‚Äôve almost been in a vegetative state, de-motivated but also just trying to experience the feeling, do I just carry on with my life as normal but with this achieved awareness? What if I start to lose the awareness? Should I engage more in meditation and yoga? I meditated for 10 minutes after researching ego dissolution, and im going to have a bath soon and do yoga anyway.

Caffeine is a mind altering substance, so I stopped consuming it.

Now I am thinking, perhaps all substances are mind altering substances... if so should I stop consuming all substances? This would include food, which creates a natural motivation for fasting.

Even so, as a human being a need to live life with food is superimposed upon me physiologically. So is the task at hand to minimize the extent to which we rely on substances?

In the case of fasting, the mind enters a different state. It is natural to desire food in this state... is one to fast until this desire no longer exists?

"Isn't belief in Samsara, rebirth and liberation a form of clinging in itself?

But if we go through with that assumption and take this point of view, doesn't Samsara and rebirth just become another sort of clinging to this world?

Experiencing Oneness and getting extreme depression afterwards,"Hi


I recently, on 21st June, for celebrating 21st of june, took LSD. During my trip I felt like all souls, all existing living beings were just one and that the universe was just made out of ""vibrations"" at the end and that the universe originally was a big, uniform sound ; and that the fact people were different people was because there have been a misunderstanding at some point, some sort of problem that once repaired would unite all beings in one and in an endless sound.


I meditated upon that for like few minutes, it felt like hours, and while I was in unity it was actually extremely pleaseant to not-feel and not-be if it makes sense 

Then I got out of my room still having this feeling that the world was one and I was one with the world, I was about to eat and then I realized that now that the whole world was united I was lonely idk, also that there was nothing to do and it was depressing as hell ? I got extremely sad and bad for few days afterwards and I was afraid that what I experienced could have actually been true ; I've thought about that a lot and read today Buddhist beliefs especially those about non-self and non-being and unity of the universe


I kinda got traumatized by experiencing this oneness, maybe because usually one should take years of meditation to reach this end and I took a shortcut to it without any prior preparation (some truths can hurt the unprepared)


I feel like I need to talk about theological stuff with buddhists especially this oneness, like is it actually what buddhism teaches ? Is it actually what you guys believe is a truth in the universe ?

If yes, what actually pushes any of you to continue to do anything in life instead of just doing nothing ?

Would a monk eat a carrot?,"A carrot is the taproot, and harvesting it requires the plant's early death.  To be edible, carrots need to be harvested before they get too woody, which is before the plant's natural death.

Does eating a carrot go against the teaching of ""do not kill""? Are we only to eat those plant parts that are readily offered by the plant for the purpose of eating (and dispersing seeds) without killing it (e.g. apples), or that otherwise do not cause death (e.g. leaves)?

Edit:. Thanks for the clarification and for pointing to Jainism for this principle. Now I need to read about sentience. The research I'm familiar with shows that plants definitely know that they've gotten damaged, whether mortally or not. Or is that more a ""reaction"" than a conscious response?

Buddhism = Nihilism?,"Hello, I am really new to Buddhism and about to deep dive into this topic.

As far as I am concerned the basic teaching is that man craving to experience more and more pleasures while avoiding pain.

According to Buddha or Buddhism feeling are like vibrations and changing every moment. So there isn‚Äôt a point in chasing the ever best feeling or taking so much effort in avoiding pain and suffering. Just let it happen‚Ä¶

The aim is to understand the impermanent nature of all feelings and stop craving them.

But if we stop the pursuit of those feelings, what is the point then? Just sitting around, observing your own emotions but not let them have any impact on you?

I can‚Äôt get my head around this. It‚Äôs like we should become cold beings which don‚Äôt let themselves get influenced by their own feelings?

Thoughts on the paradox of spirituality in the modern era?,"I find it interesting how modern culture seems to be moving away from ethics in terms of spiritual development, yet at the same time we see a revival of spirituality within traditions like Buddhism. If we use the panchasila and the athasila, the five percepts and eight precepts to examine our culture we can see that things have been in decline over the past 200 years. This is not universal. At the level of society the standard has been raised. There are less discrimination, war and injustice. But on a more personal level it seems like people are not keeping basic moral guidelines like before. Drug use has become very common, sexual misconduct has become very common. In this age of the internet people stay constantly entertained in mostly unwholesome ways. There is sense indulgence on a completely new level in this stage of capitalism. I think there is no doubt that modernity have taken most of us away from spending our days doing wholesome things, and we are a lot more distracted. In short it is a lot harder to practice meditation and sense restraint now than at any period in history. There is so much temptation and so many things that are constantly competing for our attention.     
  

On the other hand we see that the striving for spiritual awaking has been revived over the past 200 years. Not just in Buddhism, but in other Dharma traditions and also new spiritual traditions. As far as I know in most Buddhist countries personal practice towards awakening was very niche up until the modern era. The concepts of lay people meditating was unheard of in the Theravada tradition, and the monks striving for awakening was far and few between. Today it is very different. In Theravada the forest traditions have become very popular where even the lay people strive for Nibbana. Pretty much the exact same pattern is found in the traditions of Buddhism and Vedanta too. I am guessing that this pattern can be seen in most spiritual traditions that strive for awakening. And let us not forget all the westerners flocking to these traditions even though they remain very inaccessible. It seems strange that as the world becomes more worldly (indulgent, distracted, less personal ethics), the spiritual becomes more spiritual (newfound interest in reaching supreme liberation). Just imagine a person living 500 years ago, farming, doing duties to the community, no mass media, no entertainment, food was not filled with addictive crap. Life was slow and simple. That situation is ideal for a lay person to reach awakening. Yet people did not strive for it as much as today. I wonder what is really going on?     


Could it have something to do with the dissolution of the community and late stage capitalism making work feel less meaningful that drive people towards spirituality? What are your thoughts on this?",Buddhism,1632762422.0,t3_pwlk10,0.5,0

The Daily Tejaniya : How To Deal With Trump,"    
    **YOGI:**
    A yogi asks, ‚ÄúI get enraged listening to Donald Trump
    for even a few moments. His incompetence, lies, and com-
    plete lack of ethics is causing many people needlessly to
    die. How can I deal with the rage I feel towards him?‚Äù 
    
    
    **SUT:**
    We know Donald Trump is not going to change.
    We can‚Äôt change him, but we can change the quality
    of our mind. When he comes on the TV or the Inter-
    net or wherever, just start watching your mind. Attend
    to your own mind, not to Trump. Get interested in
    how the mind is reacting, not in what Trump
    is saying or in the person of Trump.  

    We need to be very clear that it is not Trump
    but our own judgments and thoughts of rage that 
    are shattering our peace of mind. Rather than spend
    our precious moments of life on Trump, change the
    object of your awareness. Change it from thinking
    about Mr. Trump, to observing what‚Äôs happening
    in your mind, or watch your feelings so you
    don‚Äôt get pulled into the thoughts.

How can anyone believe in karma when all evidence contradicts it?,"The only way I could see anyone believing in karma is if it is fueled by hubris - that is, if believing in it boosts their ego. For instance, someone believes that the reason they are successful is because they are a good and virtuous person, therefore their karma is good and led to their success and that they deserve it; conversely, they would believe that people who are not successful are evil or spiteful, thus it is their bad karma that led them down that road and they deserve it.

We all know that is not how the world works, whether or not you are willing to admit it. Success and wealth are based purely on luck. Let‚Äôs take for an example, a good mathematician. People would make the argument that that person became so skilled because they studied hard, but that is secondary to the fact that they were LUCKY enough to be born with good genetics that predispose them to intelligence and grasping math. Probably had rich and loving parents too. Everything is about luck; if you are lucky in life, you get to have a great life, and be successful and happy. If you are unlucky, everyone looks down on you, makes fun of you, excluded you, and you struggle and suffer for your whole life. What‚Äôs more, to add insult to injury, people say it‚Äôs because of some moral failing on your part, or bad karma, or sin, or whatever other label they try to pin on you to justify to themselves why they are so great and why you are beneath them.

There are so many examples in life of people who are awful human beings yet they are rich and successful. Pretty much every wealthy person is conceited, manipulative, rude, callous, selfish, and smug. There is literally no benefit to the self to being a good, compassionate, and caring person. 

I‚Äôm sick of being a loser and a failure in life just because I wasn‚Äôt born lucky. Everything in life is luck. I‚Äôm sure there will be egotistical, arrogant, self serving jackasses on this sub who will lecture me and tell me why I‚Äôm wrong and why everything is my fault, or make glib remarks insulting me. Just remember - you got lucky, and if I got all your luck and advantages, I‚Äôd be doing just as well as you if not better, and if you were stuck in my life with all my misfortunes, you‚Äôd be just as despondent, hopeless, and worthless.",Buddhism,1584582968.0,t3_fl1stg,0.47,0

Summing up Buddhism in 10 lines.,"Most of you reading this are attached to a delusion based on four fundamental misperceptions:

1. Things in existence are inherently what they are. (Inherent nature)
2. This inherent nature is stable. (Stability)
3. Yourself is part of these things in existence. (Self in existence)
4. This attachment of yourself to existence can be ultimately satisfactory. (Satisfaction of self in existence)

Against these four fundamental errors, Buddhism posits four corrections, respectively:

1. Things in existence have no inherent nature. (Emptiness)
2. Everything in existence is unstable. (Instability)
3. Yourself are not part of anything which exists. (No-self)
4. Attachment of yourself to existence will never be satisfactory. (Unsatisfactoriness)


* * * * *

Now let's add bit of an explanation about Emptiness.

It's easy to understand, even at a rational level, that everything in existence is impermanent, subject to change, and eventually will atrophy to the point of unrecognizability.

Emptiness is a more fundamental insight. It disputes that anything is what it is, even when it seems to be. Emptiness cannot be formulated or taught conceptually, since among its far-reaching lessons is the invalidation of all concepts, and the refutation of any and all conceptual truth.

Here are a few pointers.

There are two conduits readily available to us Westerners to gain some insight into emptiness: dreams and art.

They are fundamentally the same thing.

Art is essentially an attack on the delusion of inherent nature of objects.

It is a vigorous effort to escape the tyranny of reality.

Dreams just ignore this tyrannical delusion altogether.

For a more accessible explanation:

Art fights the entrenched tyranny of mundane concepts. We all saw these objects, like apple, sunrise, the human body, a million times. They become strongly established in our minds as an undisputed stable truth that simply cannot be otherwise. This inherent stable nature is the fertile ground which sprouts attachment. It is the foundation that art aims to undermine and topple. In the most mundane terms, it aims to make you look at reality with a new, fresh perspective.

Also known as ""Beginner Mind"" in Zen.

More fundamentally, art seeks to dispute and undermine the established order of concepts.

An important realization to reach at this point is that there are no objects, only concepts. We have no direct contact with reality, only concepts thereof which we established by imposing symbolic name-and-form (nama-rupa) on chaotic sense impressions.

Now that we realize that all these things aren't objects, but concepts, we can see that both art and dreams annihilate them in the same ways:

They mash them together, cut them apart, break them down to little pieces, and switch or replace them with each other.

More systematically, there are 3 fundamental mechanisms to attack those tyrannical concepts:

1. Mash them together, combining multiple concepts into a unified one.
2. Separate and break them apart, sometimes into little pieces.
3. Displace them (switch or replace one with another).

These mechanisms can and often do work together. For example: breaking multiple concepts into pieces, then combining some of these pieces into a new unified concept.

The necessity to dispute order is why art can seem random. Being ""random"" - i.e. deviating from the established conceptual order - is in fact a necessary condition for any artistic expression.

For example, [here's a musical piece about Boston's Waste Management System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hsA6jxsGJU).

Traditional Buddhist techniques to help disciples realize Emptiness include meditation, koans, abrupt actions performed by the teacher to surprise and shake the student's mind away from its entrenched conceptual tracks, shouting, and beating.

You will notice that at least four of those are Zen techniques, and indeed Zen is quite focused on imparting the insight of Emptiness.",Buddhism,1549015003.0,t3_am0isa,0.53,1

"I believe that people who ""want to become Buddhist"" have an attachment to fashion (and cheap malas).","When I was younger, all my friends listened to a particular band. That genre of music was very different from the style of music that I naturally gravitated to, but because I was motivated to fit in, I ended up appreciating that music. 

The genre of music was country, and I, with sheer will and determination, liked country music and musicians like Confederate Railroad, Dwight Yoakam, Brad Paisley, etc. 

It then occurred to me, that a person can absolutely love anything, any genre of music, any school of architecture, any fashion trends, and can harbor any opinions just by dint of trying to fit in. 

For people ""wanting to become Buddhist,"" my advice to you is this: The same motivation that you have to learn the Dharma, I say use this energy to:

* empathize, understand, and be excited helping persecuted people in your own community - the ""nerds,"" the elderly, the unpopular kids at school, the undesirable person who sits by themselves at lunch, and the people who are shunned, etc. 

* ask yourself: Do I really know the cultural environment from which Buddhism sprang from and spent its formative years? DO you know anything about the cultural under-pinnings of Buddhism, or anything about religions that came from the same foundations? I'm sure a practicing Christian knows far more about the various tribes of Israel and even pre-Christians like the Samaritans, Hebrews, Judea Province, and King David, but the Buddhists don't know anything about Jainism or Sikhism.

According to the news, [""a Buddhist mob rampaged through a town in an isolated corner of Myanmar, hacking Muslim women and children with knives""](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/16/mynanmar-buddhist-mob-kills-muslims_n_4610496.html?utm_hp_ref=religion&ir=Religion).

This piece of news hit me like lightning. I didn't know that Buddhism could nest such kind of behaviors. I knew that there are religious tensions in Asia between Buddhists and Muslims, but would've never thought that Buddhists could commit such abominable acts.

Whereas other fundamentalist religions bear hints of tolerating conflict in some circumstances in their scriptures, the Buddhist teachings are organically against any kind of violence. So what has happened in Myanmar is beyond my comprehension and an utter shock for me. I have been dreaming that Buddhism is an oasis of peace and tolerance and now I don't know anymore.

So what could be done about this abomination? That mob should be let know that they are not Buddhist at all. They should know this, they should know that their next attacks will be committed solely under their own name - not as Buddhists. Dalai Lama should take a powerful stance on this. This should never happen again, ever, under the cover of Buddhism.

Christianity vs. Buddhism,"I was raised a in a devout Christian family. I rejected the religion at a very early age, however my mother still clings to it and most of our family friends remain Christians as well. Throughout most of my life these family friends  have been nothing short of judgmental and neurotic all in the name of Christianity (which seems to be against everything that Christ taught), and this is partially what drove me away from the religion. Most Buddhists or those studying eastern philosophies, however, have been (from my perspective) extraordinarily kindhearted and compassionate individuals, free from many of the bad tendencies that many of our Christian friends had.
In addition, my father was a Christian throughout most of his life, however about 5 or so years ago he made a quiet transition from Christianity to Buddhism. Before that, he and my mother constantly fought and he was in a bad mood a lot of the time. Since ""converting"" (he attends church only when my mother requires it) it is almost like a new person was created entirely; every bad habit or tendency he had before has completely vanished and he has recently become a vegetarian as well.

In essence, I was wondering what were some of your thoughts pertaining to why it seems that Buddhism is succeeding where Christianity is failing. I have observed this time and time again, in which the actions of Buddhists differ greatly from the actions of Christians, while many of Christ's teachings seem to be in line with Buddhist thought. 

Yes, I realize this is not *always* the case and that I might be all over the page here, however I'd still like to know where this disconnect occurs and what some of your thoughts are on the subject.",Buddhism,1373613990.0,t3_1i527h,0.47,0

" Eating meat, or not eating meat, is not at all what the point buddha was trying to point at.","My experience here has been that the concept of vegetarianism reducing suffering, or veganism reducing suffering, or whatever else there is in that kind of thought I am not sure of, is something worth striving towards. it is only partially true. at best. Animals live in the realm of being food for other animals. only humans (most, at least, some adventurers obviously do not share that fate) are excluded from that. and the point behind buddhism is not to make some kind of paradise on earth; such a thing could never happen. the point is to get rid of the ideas and concepts of life and death itself. only then can you actually be free. 

I am not free from this stuff. I'll gladly admit! but I have done practice for long enough that I know that vegetarianism or veganism or whatever else is totally missing the point!",Buddhism,1358839713.0,t3_171m4q,0.44,0

Can some of our Theravada members consider being a little less... transparently sectarian when people ask for advice on beginning with Buddhism?,"I feel like there's a divide between what people recommend to new people asking for general information, where most posters link to fairly broad non-sectarian resources, and some posters from Theravada traditions exclusively link to Theravada resources. I understand that the relationship between Theravada and Mahayana historically hasn't been the most sectarianism-free, but it's starting to be consistent enough that it feels somewhat like bad faith sectarianism.

I'm a Tibetan Buddhist, and you can find recent posts in my post history agreeing that the Dhammapada is not a bad starting point for a very broad overview of Buddhism. I have little issue directing people towards resources that are heavy on Theravada material because I'd rather people practice the Dharma than not, and if Theravada practices work for them then that's commendable, but it's beginning to leave a bit of a bad taste in my mouth, personally. I don't know if I'm alone in this perspective, and if so I'll take the L and move on with my day, but I'd really like to see a more concerted effort at non-denominational advice when people come seeking new things.

This *especially* goes for presenting Theravada historiography as inherently true; both teachings have equal (historical) claim to originality. While I understand the Theravadin perspective differs on this, the subtle implication of the illegitimacy of Mahayana does show up in many of these posts. We can be better, and we can be less sectarian.

>I see a common misconception in the comments. The problem is not with quoting suttas - or Theravada authorities like Buddhaghosha - but with claiming that these are the only original texts of Buddhism.

"Finally realized why people go to parties with loud music, dancing, drinking, and drugs.","It's an untrained, unskillful method to stop thought.

Non-Violence taken to an extreme seems like a luxury and a cop-out,"I‚Äôm sorry, but there are children being sold into sex slavery every day. If Buddhism teaches non-violence to the extreme of not cracking down on perps of these sorts of demented things, where is the logic? How is it righteous to only be open to acts of gentle service, but be against the ferocity required when defending the innocent from tyranny?
This is not to say violence should be used as a first resort, but there are many situations in which defense is necessary, especially through the lens of seeing how it effects those unable to defend themselves. Most Buddhists I have met are single, have no children, do not have a connection to society other than acts of service, which is helpful and good, but does not encompass all of the ways humans find themselves interacting on this earth. If I had had the chance to kill Jeffrey Epstein, I would have done it. It‚Äôd be great if he would have healed, but if I had had the opportunity to end his time here, I would have done it for the sake of his victims.

Buddhist Interpretation of Pok√©mon Cosmology,"In the Pok√©mon franchise, several things seem to be true that seem to draw an analogy to Buddhist teachings.

In Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl, the main antagonist's goal is to escape suffering and he identifies 'Spirit' or 'Heart' as the main culprit. He believes the human spirit is flawed and would prefer to live in a world that is devoid of spirits. Through various means, he tries to forcefully create a new world that was 'pure' and without spirit.

When I came across a basic explanation of Pure Land buddhism, I was reminded of this plot, so I explored it a bit more.

Buddhism assumes no Creator, but in various teachings that are passed down, it is also said that, rather than creating themselves and then the planes, deities descend to planes of existence at their creation (for as far as the concept of a beginning and end applies) to shape it. In the pok√©mon franchise, Arceus appears to be fulfilling a similar role, descending from another plane and then using emanations of himself to order it. The pok√©mon world has always been the world of kami from Shinto religion, but this makes me wonder if perhaps it is also meant emulate pure land.

The pok√©mon franchise also makes clear that this is but one in a massive web of world, which reminded me of the Net of Indra. Which in turn reminded me that, in the pok√©mon world, that 'net' may be more literal than simply an analogy to explain the interpenetration of the dharma. Residents in the pok√©mon world do not question that they can exchange pok√©mon with residents of other realities.",Buddhism,1636377490.0,t3_qpdgax,0.53,1

About the gods.,"One of the things I see so often here, is a casual disregard, a misunderstanding and fundamental lack of empathy regarding deities. 

Because of this, I want to set the record straight on their behalf. It means more to me than is so often quoted. If any of you are actually a real Buddhist, then you will understand. 

Gods are people. They are, fundamentally no different than us. In realms without the teaching, many of them live lives of service to others. The weight of hundreds, of thousands of years is behind that statement. 

Many gods see the Dharma, and they eventually become Dharma protectors. Many, Many gods choose this path. I've seen enough to know that, statistically speaking, any random god more likely to achieve enlightenment than any random human weighted on balance with time.. This is a fact. The reason it's taught otherwise has more to do with accumulation and what was, rather than anything else. Time does not move at same pace betwen realms. 

I guess, what I want you guys to understand is how much they are there for us. They're the ones that in our practice whisper to us when we lose our way and fall short. They're the ones that facilitate the most basic aspects of our ability to practice. If you've ever experienced intervention, 9/10 it's them. That is the reality of this world. 

They are us. They are every wish we ever had and the manifestation of our metta. At least, many do their best to be. I just.. want you guys to know. So often the invisible voice that brings you to the next point.. it's them. More than anything else, they are people. People who push us forward and help us overcome in our practice. It  is always them. The Dharma protectors.

Never ever look down on the gods. Many of them are buddhists and do their absolute best for the sake of others.

As lacking as I am, this at least I've seen. I guess I just wanted people to know. So, so few understand just how hard they work, what they actually do. Thank you for reading.",Buddhism,1689881064.0,t3_1550jlw,0.61,13

These claims are so beyond human experience/verification that they must be regarded as metaphysical. They are so fantastical and also specific that they are totally ascientific. Floating mansions in the air for beings that live for thousands of years ‚Äî really? Indeed, some of these realms are formless, and so there‚Äôs no material interaction to be had, no basis upon which one might design an experiment to support a testable model. And that‚Äôs totally leaving aside that these realms supposedly facilitate conscious awareness in the absence of a physical substrate. 

Why bother teaching about them? How are they useful towards the cessation of suffering? What purpose does it serve? If the point is to indicate that liberation takes a long time and nothing lasts forever, why not just say that? If they‚Äôre simply metaphors for states of mind, which seems most practical, why not just say that?

A lot of the Buddha‚Äôs teachings and very reasonable and practical, but I‚Äôm struggling to find any utility in this intricate cosmology. To take it as literally and physically real is just incomprehensible, and so far removed from the otherwise grounded and immediately applicable teachings. I get the whole arguing with the doctor about who shot the poisoned arrow and what the arrow was made of etc. Is this complex cosmological model not just yet another distraction from receiving the medicine that would end the suffering? How does it actually help any living being?

It seems to me to just be a cultural, mythological trapping. But I‚Äôm open to and eager to learn of any better explanation.

How does Buddhism fulfill the need for human relationships,"I'm sorry but this entire religion just doesn't seem to me to hit the fundamental  for human relationships very well. Everything from the Buddha going off to meditate on his own for a long time as the way to enlightenment, to the fact that monks do the same, to the way some of the Suttas I've read preach a detached loner lifestyle (like the rhino horn one,) to the fact that in order to truly detach and let go one must let go of their human attachments as well... I'm sorry but this just seems too hard for me to swallow. I'm already extremely lonely and it's killing me. I can't imagine accepting that loneliness and continuing to live alone.

4. It talked about Earth being heaven and the diety we worship is the God of Heaven.

5. It talked about the 7 levels you have to go through in life before reaching Enlightenment.

6. It talked about each day being one year. Noon = Summer, Morning = Spring Midnight=Winter, Evening = Fall

7. It talked about how those who have not learned there lesson in this life will be forced to re-live it again, and again until they do.

8. It talked about how we should all strive to become Bodisattva

Sexual misconduct in the sutras,"It was my understanding that the sexual misconduct in the five precepts related to adultery, rape, or having sex with a celibate monk. I was [reading an early sutra](https://read.84000.co/translation/toh287.html#UT22084-068-021-42) from the Kangyur and was surprised to see it was against oral sex and anal sex exclusively.

> ...sexual misconduct occurs when one penetrates one‚Äôs own wife, or another man‚Äôs wife, through an opening other than the vagina, or when one rejoices in others performing such an act, or when one makes others engage in it even while refraining from doing so oneself. 

If you don't end up in hell, as an animal, or hungry ghost, this bad karma may ripen as having a disrespectful wife in the next life OR being born a [hermaphrodite](https://read.84000.co/translation/toh287.html#UT22084-068-021-59). 

I'm not a scriptural fundamentalist and I think it can often be clear which parts are political and worldly and which are truly inspired and holy. But this surprised me, especially since it does not include adultery. 

Also, Buddhism is considered to be welcoming to all people in modern times, but I can't help but wonder what a gay man or other LGBTQIA+ persons might think reading this.

enlightenment? did I achieve it as a child without knowing?,"It seems ridiculous now but, when I was a child, between the ages of 10-14 I got into a habit, whereby when I was in bed at night (no, not that habitüòÇ)  before I went to sleep I used to hold my hand up in the dark and stare at it and think about the universe and my place in it.

I did this for the first time without planning it or knowing what I was doing and I achieved a great sense of enlightenment. I was overwhelmed with the sense of it and It felt dizzying. I felt that I had done something that had a great effect on my being. I focused on my place in the universe and the complete insignificance of it. I then felt a rush throughout my body. I felt amazing afterward.


After this,  I continued to do this for a brief time in my childhood. I was excited to go to bed knowing that I was going to ""meditate"" and the rush that I would get. 
 It eventually fizzled out and I more or less completely forgot about it.

I didn't really think about it again until years later when apps like headspace and calm brought meditation back to my attention.

I have since tried guided meditation a fair bit and have found it to be very good for sleeping and to have some good mental health benefits for me but i have never been able to properly get into the state of mind that I had as a child and fully relax, or achieve and enlightenment. 

I blame this on the stresses of modern adult life such as work, marriage,  children, mobile phones etc 

I was able to fully engage without guided meditation as a child and achieve something that is still with me to this day. Whereas now I find it hard to even relax enough to organise my breathing to do a session of guided meditation on calms app.

This seems to be untenable as Buddhism seems quite sure of the existence of suffering. Following that, it must be necessary for something  - with existence - to be suffering. I think therefore I am.  How far does non-dualism go? Is existence not necessary to understand anything and must be assumed?  There is not even a first step without the assumption of existence.

I came to this question because, to my understanding, Buddhism is monistic. Is Nirvana not much like Kant's Thing-In-Itself and Schopenhauer's Will, which is completely unconditioned yet can still be said to exist? I don't think the Thing-In-Itself contradicts non-self, as it is indistinguishable from any other thing. It is everything after all. 

Please help me understand why Buddhism is not monistic.",Buddhism,1634214438.0,t3_q7ynmh,0.45,0

I would like some real advice on this,"I need some advice

Hello everyone! Long time lurker and first time actually posting here. I want to tell everyone a story here and I would like some opinions.



I‚Äôm going to pre-face the story with some things about myself and we can get into it from there, I am a ‚Äúwhite‚Äù (not really) man who was in the military to be exact to the infantry. Since getting out of the military and moving on to different things in my life, I have had a overhaul and a rehaul of who I am as a human being. I am a Yogi, I am a vegetarian, and I have converted to Buddhism. I am by no means perfect but I live my life as a secular Buddhist the best way I can. 


Currently I work at a small family bar and French bistro in Arizona. It is a very prosperous bar, upscale and the new thing on the block. We get immense traffic and it‚Äôs great. 


Since day one of working at this establishment, I have been met with some resistance from one of the owners nieces. She is as she puts it ‚Äúwoke, an activist, gay, a feminist‚Äù she is Hispanic, (and whiter than I, who is native and Moroccan and Portuguese but I don‚Äôt give a shit about race so I just say ‚Äúwhite‚Äù as I am fair skinned and slightly tanned) And from the first day of us meeting has made very rude comments to me that I can only subscribe as to things that would get someone immediately terminated. 

The comments first started with her telling me to my face in front of coworkers that she judges me for being a white man that‚Äôs an imperialist from the military who has committed war crimes, which of course is a straw man if I ever heard one. I wonder if she knows that I, with my unit, rescuers 100 woman out of sex slavery in Africa? Goes against her agenda so most likely not. Anyway. 

Things have slowly reached a tipping point, lastly with her telling me that it‚Äôs disgusting that a white man thinks he can be a Yogi or a Buddhist. The other day we had an incident at work where she was sticking up for a table and not the server even though the table was harassing the server to try to get free food, the table happen to be two women. As I was explaining the situation to the owner she started chiming in with small snippets about how I don‚Äôt know that table, they were nice to her, and I‚Äôm being judgmental. When I looked at her and I asked her are you doing this because I am a man and those are women or because I‚Äôm a white man and those are black women? She responded with and I quote ‚Äú you white piece of shit misogynistic motherfucker fuck you and your white family‚Äù and stormed off in front of customers. Mind you I work at a nice place, not a damn chili‚Äôs. The evidence will also show, to the kangaroo court in session, that the true colors came out when she was called out. Instead of helping and backing up her female teammate who is new, she immodestly and effectively begins to take sides when she has no idea what‚Äôs going on. It‚Äôs the most obvious case of identity politics at a ground level I have ever seen, in a damn upscale bar of all places!

After speaking with the owner, it has become apperantly that the issue is me. I‚Äôm ‚Äúwhite‚Äù, I‚Äôm a male, I‚Äôm what you would consider not a beta man (I will not use the word alpha, so cringe) but I am tall, muscular, I box, I‚Äôm kind of loud and fun. I‚Äôm your typical dude. Except I‚Äôm a philanthropist, activist, and scholar. This woman‚Äôs entire identity and her views is to be against someone like myself. She knows it, I know it, the management knows it. 



The owner became infuriated with the situation, obviously not myself but with her. My question to everyone here is this is a group of thinkers philosophers and people in the realm of law and ethics, how should I respond to this? If this was any other company with an HR she would be terminated, in fact she would‚Äôve been terminated months ago for her actions toward me that I have documented in email and on my phone. If this was any other race or sex of person in the roles were reversed there would be a lawsuit, full stop. 

Being that I walk or try to at least a different path in life, I will not be asking for her to be fired nor will I be asking for a lawsuit or trying to obtain any damages but my question to everyone here is how do you see the best way of going around rectifying this? Nothing I‚Äôve said here is exaggerated and it is the full spectrum of what she has said to me among other things she said. Does anyone see a real way around this? I could easily get another job where I making just as much money which is around 300 a day but, why do that when I can try to bounce some ideas off of my fellow secularist, humanist, and Buddhist.",Buddhism,1622485436.0,t3_np9vd5,0.54,1

"Brahman is real, just empty on a larger scale","So for context, I went to school to study astrophysics before getting into spirituality. Brahman as a concept always made sense with the science we see. All of matter is actually just condensed energy emerging from a latent field that permeates everything. We are like waves in the ocean, not seperate from the ocean, but made up of it. 
But I also recognize emptiness as true. Everything is dependant on everything else, there is no inherent nature to any individual. The blade of grass is as much the water it drinks, as it is the sun it grows under. But we cannot ignore that physics does tell is there is an essence in this universe. So my thought is, Brahman is real, is the energetic foundation of this universe. But this isn't the only universe, not the only Brahman. So while Brahman is real, it is empty in connection to a wider omniverse. 
Is this a thought others have had? I feel strongly drawn to Buddhism, but I cannot deny Brahman as a concept is valid. This seems like a good middle way.",Buddhism,1611775509.0,t3_l6cahe,0.5,0

Buddhism leads to the extinction of mankind,"Dhamma teaches us to overcome desire. The moral rules therefore include that one must live in complete chastity, which is totally understandable. But if all the people in the world lived according to dhamma, humanity would die out, because there would be no reproduction. And is a teaching the right one if it leads to the extinction of humanity? In my opinion: No, it isn't. I like the Buddha, I like dhamma. But this one thought is still the one that keeps me from accepting it as the truth. 
Of course, it is very unlikely that everyone in the world would follow the teaching. But it is important in morality, which you think is the right one and you want to live according to it and spread it further, to use the categorical imperative of Immanuel Kant: Act only according to that¬†maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.

"I think the beauty of music, art, and mathematics is associated with Jhana, and hints at the nature of Nirvana","I often attain Jhana, or strengthen an ongoing Jhana, by becoming absorbed in the beauty of a musical piece, an artistic work, or a mathematical insight.

The same logic which the Buddha applied to his first Jhana, applies here: it is a wholesome pleasure, entirely divorced of sensuality or any unwholesome state.

An effect so profound has to penetrate all the way to the deepest nature - to Nirvana.

I was slightly disappointed to read that Theravadin monks were forbidden from listening to music. My guess is that this is an archaic rule from a time when music had to be played live, typically in the context of some unwholesome revelry. I am sure the Buddha would not condemn a [piece like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3x18VxqdLk).

Today, he was speaking to 2 girls, and he didn't include me. He didn't even say hey to me. He made no attempt to say hello to me either. 

The people at this sanga are interested in Buddhism because they were interested in a practice that could benefit them and make them more calm and mindful (that's the outwards reason that they give), instead of wanting to benefit OTHERS. Moreover, my suspicion is that these sanga members are very status oriented and are attending this sanga as a sort of an intellectual achievement or a source of prestige.

I love my girlfriend very much and have learned to recognize the ""formless"" within her. It's not her physical body I am attached to, it's the bond we have of our souls. Unfortunately, Buddhism states that you must let go of all attachments. I simply believe that a man and woman partnership is like the yin yang and can be spiritually healing. I can understand removing the attachment, the value you think the person will add in your life, but not celibacy. Sex can be spiritually healing and rejuvenating! Why is sex condemned then?

Vast Impersonal Intelligence,"I had an intense peak experience recently, which I revisited some aspects of my previous realizations/experience.

There is a vast impersonal natural intelligence which is living you, or rather, it IS this life, this breathing, this walking, this drinking... this life of the universe, of the earth spinning, .... all an interconnected play of Dharma, of total life, intelligence, and awareness. The only blockage is simply this sense of an 'I', someone who controls will and dictates actions in life.

If you think that I am sounding like an advocate of 'God', I have to reiterate that this so called 'God' or intelligent Mind is empty of its own existence apart from Dharma (whatever sensed, experienced, cognized), is not something changeless and independent, and is not some sort of source acting behind the scenes or pulling the strings. Because this vast impersonal intelligence is so magnificent, powerful and impersonal, it can give the impression that we are all just the dream or expression of a Universal Mind of God, and if we follow this 'personification' and 'reification' we may start to think whether we are living in a matrix, a dream of Shiva for no other reason than his own enjoyment. But we are not the play or lila of a Brahman, there is no need to personify or reify this at all. This intelligence IS the miracle of manifestation. The divine has no face of its own, and yet every face is the face of divinity. There is no I, no perceiver, or a controller of this spontaneous intelligent happening. Living this is living in complete ecstasy and joy born of this total intelligence, life and clarity.

I just found something by Daniel Ingram which pretty much describes it nicely:

""Thus, sensations of effort are just sensations of effort, but imply no fundamental split off entity that is making this effort. It is just a natural product of the interdependent universe. Just so, the sense of a will is replaced with a mysterious sense of absolutely natural causality and a natural, creative ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù that operates in all of this, though the sensations that make up the sense of will continue as before. This is what is meant in the teachings of the twelve links of dependent origination when it says, ‚ÄúWith the complete cessation of [fundamental] ignorance, volitional formations cease.‚Äù Similarly, sensations of intimacy are just sensations of intimacy and simply imply proximity rather than a separate self. Those of third path know this to some degree, and those of second path can look into this to try to attain the understanding of third path. Arahats have fully understood this.""
(note: his definition of 'Arahat' is different from the suttas definition)

Also in moments of peak experience, I see we have to overcome the habitual tendencies of distracted thoughts... means we must be able to completely silent our mind and be able to have no thoughts at all to fully experience the fullness and presence of our six senses without a single trace of thought or sense of self... the trees, the sky, the breeze, everything in its complete intensity without thoughts. I'm not saying thought must be stopped at all moments, but like Eckhart Tolle said, after awakening 90% of his (unnecessary) thoughts just disappeared and thats what make a difference to his life. Without this we will not be able to feel the intensity of total Presence. So meditate and do yoga. Realization alone is insufficient without shamatha. Yes, you can experience anatta even when there are wandering thoughts because it is always already so, but one can never fully appreciate the Presence, total life, intelligence and awareness... it is a whole different level.

In other words: thoughts are ok, but you must have 'mastery' over them. Means unnecessary thoughts do not arise.",Buddhism,1427073510.0,t3_2zyq9n,0.54,1
Could Psychedelics be used to aid Buddhist practices?,"""Traditional mainstream Buddhist training does not include the use of mind-altering substances. With very few possible exceptions, they are simply not mentioned in the sutras and other texts. Some think that they are dealt with in the precept that states *""a disciple of the Buddha does not intoxicate mind or body of self or others"".* Others think differently: the same poll mentioned above found that almost 60% of the responding Buddhist practitioners felt that psychedelics and Buddhism do mix and that they would consider taking psychedelics in a sacred context (in the ""under 20"" category this percentage was 90%).

There's no greater peace than the cessation of thought,"To be able to stop inner discourse is bliss.

This skill is very precious, it frees you from your own thoughts.

Free your mind from itself, from words and concepts. Understand that they are mere illusions. They are tools that can become traps.

Never remain in what is called the formless realm of thought too long, or it will trap you.

If you find yourself with your mind not being able to stand still, your sight blurry, your hearing being annoyed by any sound or word, your touch insensitive, your nose dry, your body tired and low in energy, drowsy; stay in contemplation, be still in observation. Be energetic, or it will drown you. Soon disease will attack you, emotions will be uncontrollable, and bad karma will follow. Do not panic, remember that your nature is that of the buddha, perfect and enlightened, remember there's no reason to be not ok; there's nothing we actually need, nothing that can actually affect us, we only convince ourselves deeply that it does affect us.

Stay in contemplation, assume whatever bad karma you may have created knowing that it too shall pass not in sadness, but in understanding that it's nothing but dust traveling in your path, and focus. This will take you out of samsara quick enough.",Buddhism,1394175421.0,t3_1zsipi,0.46,0
Thoughts on what buddhism is.,"The practice of buddhism is essentially the adjusting of the components of one's psychological reward system to be primarily items over which one has the most immediate dominion so that overall satisfaction--and hopefully wellbeing generally--is as accessible and reliable as possible. Additionally, developing a strong foundational reward system configuration is beneficial to the process of conducting ventures to achieve additional satisfaction in realms over which one has less dominion than the items already secured in one's psychological reward system. This is because coming at a new task from an already-existing position of strength and moderate satisfaction is more effective than an approach dominated by an attitude of desperation and weakness.

The most objective manifestation of this process is found in the practice of meditation, a process that distances the conscious mind from its normal thinking routine. This routine is that of constantly exploring, re-exploring, and over-exploring one's real or imagined needs and wants and the various urgent tasks required to achieve them. The non-meditating mind appears to be in a state of overactive commentery on one's life and anything remotely relevant to it. Some non-meditative activities, such as entertainment, are popular because they seem to distract this state of overactive commentery from doing its work on the self and onto other things. 

The difference between entertainment and meditation is that while entertainment distracts the mind from the its life by redirecting the perpetual commentery and mental activity to another object, meditation allows the mind to truly rest and regain stamina by seeking to quiet this tiring activity. To focus one's attention solely on the breath requires the mind to adjust its pace and energy from that required to integrate and interact with a complex smattering of facts and ideas to that required to merely patiently observe a slow and gentle binary physiological process. Doing this repeatedly helps nudge out items unskillfully placed in one's psychological reward system.",Buddhism,1391842024.0,t3_1xc9k3,0.5,0
Secular Humanism and Secular Buddhism,"Perhaps the biggest difference between Humanism and Buddhism is that Humanism is a set of principles to be believed and followed, and Buddhism is a path to be practiced. Essential to the notion of a ‚Äúpath‚Äù is the distinction between where we are now and where we are headed. Humanism has philosophical parents, such as the Stoics, that recall Buddhist principles, but it will perhaps be instructive (following philosophers like Owen Flanagan) to use Aristotle‚Äôs approach to ethics as an apt comparison to the Buddhist path.

For Aristotle the aim of philosophy is to bring us well-being or ‚Äúeudaimonia‚Äù. One who lives a life of eudaimonia is distinguished from the the many (‚Äúhoi polloi‚Äù), who do not aim at the highest good. Similarly, Buddhism distinguishes samsaric existence, unstable and hence unsatisfactory, from the potential to attain a more reliable state of well-being or ‚Äúnirvana‚Äù.

Unresolvable Plurality in Buddhist Metaphysics?,"The moral force of karma derives from the notion that we must live with the consequences of our actions and that even death is no barrier to the consequences being visited on us (or someone linked to us in a way we care about). It is fundamentally fear of negative consequences, particularly a bad rebirth, that pushes the unawakened Buddhist to be ethical; and the prospect of liberation from repeated death that pulls them along. This implies that the person who lives out the consequences of my present actions must in some way still be me. I must feel a sense of ownership over my actions and their consequences. In other words karma implies some kind of personal continuity or it doesn't make sense in human terms.

Ikeda's Cult of Personality Synonymous to Idol Worship within the SGI.,"A Cult of Personality tantamount to idol worship is evidenced by the extreme obsession of SGI members for their ultimate hero and frequently personal savior (otherwise known as master/mentor), Daisaku Ikeda.  Individual members will vehemently deny worshiping the ground he walks on, but close observation of the SGI membership behavior and attitude reveals how the organization consistently places a superhuman-like Ikeda high upon a pedestal of adornment, elevated far beyond all others.  Since the embarrassingly mud-slinging split between SGI (lay org) and NST (temple Org) two decades ago over control of the vast membership and its potentially enormous monetary donations, the push by SGI to establish Ikeda as absolutely essential to each member's personal practice has only deepened and intensified, further pressing home the point regarding the claims that the unelected, unselected, self-appointed, and unaccountable Ikeda and his SGI empire do indeed qualify as a religious cult. (Note: not trying to claim here that something positive can never result from associating with this organization - just pointing out some grotesquely major flaws in the organization‚Äôs dogmatic doctrines that are contradictory with the essence and spirit of Buddhism as commonly understood and accepted).  

Ikeda is presented to the members as a father figure, whose requisite guidance is absolutely indispensable to maintaining so-called ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù faith.  The CULTivation of a special magical relationship gushing with emotional devotion for Ikeda by each member is obligatory for advancement in practice and/or leadership position by SGI. This characteristic of the SGI alone should begin to set off warning bells with anyone interested in joining, as well as for those newer members not yet spell bound and ensnared by polished propaganda and constant pressure by leaders to ""make a determination‚Äù to get ""closer"" to the perpetually unapproachable master/mentor.    

Ikeda is regarded by the SGI as the equal of Gandhi and M.L. King, and in hushed tones, even as the Buddha of modern times.  He is treated with super-star status by the membership (a feat devotedly enabled by generating mentor propaganda to the membership by his organization's leaders). His books and publications fill SGI bookstores to the brim, where members are constantly pressured by leaders or through sales campaigns to buy in-house publications and to purchase subscriptions that provide enormous profits.  Members have been known to sacrifice their homes, personal finances, and life savings (and sometimes even spousal relationships) in order to provide cripplingly large and often unaffordable monetary donations during regular SGI contribution campaigns. The SGI even has a program to help arrange legal documentation so that the SGI (and consequently Ikeda) will automatically receive your estate instead of your family upon your death. Ikeda has become a multi-billionaire that has built his enormous wealth upon the backs of countless unpaid hard working, dedicated, well-intentioned, and purposefully mentally-conditioned membership, programmed to volunteer themselves into a sleep-deprived oblivion, while unknowingly advancing the unscrupulous objectives of Ikeda to obtain ever increasing amounts of wealth and power by their supposedly flawless  mentor/master.  

The SGI reinforces the artificial importance and magnitude of Ikeda in the indoctrinated minds (attending schools be they public or religious almost universally deliver indoctrinated minds) of members through many different means. One example:  the indication that no other human alive could be as awesome as Ikeda at dispensing wise and magnificent guidance. Or in another example, the unwritten direction regarding the placement of his picture directly upon their altars, or hanging beside the altar on the wall. An even more bizarre example exists in the self-surrendering acceptance of Ikeda by each member as his or her life-long master (mentor). For many decades, the overly self-indulgent Ikeda has enjoyed the jet-setting idolized rock star lifestyle of the ultra-privileged elite while hidden behind closed gates, limos, army of bodyguards, and presidential hotel suites, He has long enjoyed his celebrity status while misusing adoring disciples to serve as hand servants and vassals for his personal prestige, while steadily building his corrupt empire, financial holdings, and counterfeit appearance of legitimacy. Ikeda‚Äôs thinly disguised level of total control and influence over the minds and hearts of SGI members is appalling to the average Buddhist or the outside observer and hard as rock evidence of indulgence in cult behavior.

Soka Gakkai and Ikeda also established a powerful political party with the intention of taking control of the Japanese government‚Äôs parliamentarian Diet. Ikeda and his radical followers have been convicted of criminal interference with elections. Soka Gakkai members under Ikeda's leadership are widely known in Japan for their extreme and militant behavior, and excessively radical forced conversion methods. Furthermore, Ikeda has used his massive wealth to purchase precious artworks and to obtain a garish number of university degrees, and has used internally publicized ‚Äúdialogues‚Äù with highly recognized and influential individuals in an obtuse attempt to establish legitimacy and credibility both within and beyond his wealthy and powerful organization.  

Ikeda's carefully concealed ego and lust for power underlie his crafted meteoric rise to the top of the SGI organizational pyramid, where he commands millions (mostly in Japan) of deluded and obsessed minions as they lovingly hang upon his every word (leaders having sworn to ""give their lives"" for the continual expansion of the SGI organization, otherwise known as the twisted and tormented goal of ""World Peace"" - where Ikeda and his SGI would rule the world through their religious organization with absolute authority and power over all others.)  However, none of these aspects would be immediately apparent to anyone naively attending a discussion (conversion) meeting or being love-bombed by happily zealous Ikeda-bots into joining the SGI (because making a conversion is considered to be a massive karmic benefit for‚Ä¶  the gain-motivated member that receives credit for the conversion).  How twisted is a top-down organization that encourages over-indulgence and greed by example, including guidance to chant for anything one may desire - with little or no concern of bad karma created by unwise choices.

As death approaches for the elderly Ikeda (if not already here - how would anyone know for sure?), Ikeda‚Äôs lackluster son is being groomed to take over the leadership of the SGI in a brash move that would establish an ongoing Ikeda family dynasty of SGI presidents.  The imagined heroic martyrdom of the father will be forever established while the adoration of all SGI members would be magically transferred to his undistinguished and not so illustrious son, and would introduce a tradition similar to the current family dictatorship ruling  North Korea.  

Any one of the preceding statements regarding Ikeda/SGI should warrant serious caution and reflection, but taken together, demand extreme prudence and further independent research into the SGI and its cult behavior as exhibited by Ikeda, his SGI empire, and its self-perpetuating obsession with establishing Ikeda as the supreme mentor (master) of all Buddhists.  Regarding one‚Äôs former faith, there is NO tolerance, only lip-service to tolerance - if you've been with a different sect or religion, your old religious or meditative practices are regarded as worthless (and eventually you will be ‚Äúencouraged‚Äù to get rid of any connections to your former beliefs.)  Contrary to rhetoric, relationships with perplexed friends and family may also need to be sacrificed in the wake of following unending guidance (control) in pursuit of becoming a perfect SGI member or leader and devotee of Ikeda.

Let this be a clarion call to na√Øve marks and unsusecting potential victims tempted to listen and accept at face value the outlandish propaganda spewed out by the SGI that serves to establish their leader as the supreme practitioner of all Buddhism and every SGI members' ultimate mentor (master).  Advancing in one‚Äôs Buddhist practice cannot be so easily accomplished by unquestioningly following the guidance of a Jesus-perfect mystical leader (he magically knows when your chanting is sincere or your ichinen is pure) or a self-praising organization that declares ""we have the ONLY way to happiness for EVERYONE‚Äù (because you know - all others will fall into hell and have their heads broken into seven pieces unless they practice exactly as the SGI dictates).  The SGI misses the Buddhist mark completely with the adoration, veneration, and deification of Ikeda.  What has always been essential in Buddhism is to doubt everything, and to then discover and to follow one's own true path ‚Äì precisely the opposite of blind acceptance of a slickly packaged religious faith that dangles the proverbial carrot before hungry eyes.       

Ikeda is no Buddha. Not by any means. Ikeda's carefully concealed lifelong quest for power and wealth are not even remotely consistent with the aspirations or objectives of a Buddha.  Yet his extremely exaggerated importance and status as extolled by the SGI's dogmatic doctrines would have Ikeda's magnitude surpassing even that of the historical
Buddha.  The tenant regarding the extreme importance of  ‚ÄúIkeda as my master in life‚Äù has been inescapably encoded into the veiled (and sometimes not so veiled) doctrines of the SGI.  Furthermore, after a lifetime of purportedly perfect SGI practice, Ikeda has not attained Enlightenment. What then does that signify for the SGI members under his ultimate and supposedly infallible leadership and guidance toward the promise of attaining Buddhahood without fail in this lifetime?    

Since the (sales) pressure to join in but never leave can be tremendous yet subtle, it would be prudent for those interested in joining to first take a very close look at what is hidden under the SGI sheets before making any hasty decisions to get in bed together ‚Äì for all this unbridled Ikeda-ism presents an extreme case of  ‚Äúbuyer beware‚Äù!

Why God Became A Buddha,"I came across this book, [Why God Became A Buddha](http://www.amazon.com/Why-Became-Buddha-Metteyya-Brahmana/dp/0988708310/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1375375193&sr=8-1&keywords=Why+God+Became+a+Buddha) through a conversation on goodreads.com with the author.

I haven't read it, but it sounds very interesting, so I thought I would post a blurb about it here.

Commence blurb:

>For many of us who grew up in a theistic world of 'God', the idea of God becoming a Buddha may seem confusing and disorienting, as we tend to think of God as the creator of the physical universe and ""the Buddha"" as just a human being within this creation. And while it is certainly true that the historical Buddha (Siddhattha Gotama) was a human being just like us, this book examines his past lives as a God, his discourses to the Gods, and central teachings from the Dhamma he taught to shed light on the logic and nature of Buddhist Cosmology and its relationship to the path of spiritual liberation from the things that make us suffer.

>One may ask, how could a God who ruled the universe not be fully liberated spiritually, as the awe, overwhelming power, and genius of the physical universe appears beyond human comprehension, and therefore its ruler must have achieved the highest state of being. Complete mastery of the physical laws of the universe - the elusive goal of science - is widely considered the ultimate in human development. But through examining Buddhist Cosmology and the numerous discourses the historical Buddha gave on the nature of the God(s), we learn that the Gods were/are imperfect and addicted to form and/or sense gratification, and had many spiritual fetters that kept them bound to the gross and finer material realms of existence despite significant spiritual advancement.

What about when anger is the most appropriate emotion to feel,"Anger, many social psychologists argue, is a useful emotion. It may tell us that someone is treating us unfairly or dishonestly, bullying us, or creating intolerable situations.

Responses to one's own anger, while often very damaging, can aslo have the benefit of protecting us by letting others know that we think their behavior is not acceptable and it needs to change. If we do not tell the offendeer that, they very well may continue with the behavior that is angering us. Why should they stop if there are no consequences?

"Something happened to me tonight, and I don't think I'll ever be the same.","Earlier tonight, while waiting for the release of Black Ops 2, I smoked what my cousin told me was weed. It probably wasn't simply weed, because something happened to me that I can only describe as a 'bad trip', even though I've never done any hallucinogenics. My reality shattered. I still have no words that I know that will make the thoughts and feelings that I experienced for a few short minutes coherent enough to be
truly understood, but I can say a few things. First, it was terrifying. I believe that the moment in my life, at least up until now, in which
I experienced the most fear and/or anxiety was this one. I had no control over what was happening to me. Later, I would describe the initial minutes of what happened to me to my cousin as feeling like I was stuck in some kind of loop that only lasted a few seconds but seemed to go on for eons, only there was really no 'I'. I know that that sounds strange, but the closest I've come to putting one of the feelings that I had into English is that I felt as if I were all that is, and that everything was me, and that everything was that moment. I can remember it feeling like it took years for me to realize that the things that my cousin were saying to me were not the things he had just been saying to me. There was also this concept that was horrifying to me, something that for some reason makes me recall a word like brood or bluud. It was the concept that what was happening right now had never happened before, or something like that. I was in a car, so I started thinking about cars, and about why cars, and why people, and what are people...I'm not leaving out words, that is just the best feeling way to describe what I was thinking about. After I finally came down, and I say finally even though it only lasted about 5-8 minutes, I felt, and still feel, like something fundamental changed in me. I don't know how I ended up on /r/Zen, and then /r/Buddhism, but what I'm reading on here, in the sidebar..It's REALLY clicking. I just ordered the book Hardcore Zen by Brad Warner, since it was suggested for skeptics in a sidebar post. I don't know how Buddhism and Zen view recreational drug use, again, I'm VERY new to all this. I've been an athiest for years now, with no spiritual views, but this...is really making sense. The stuff I'm reading about like impermanence and interconectivity are making so much sense. I just want some advice. Where should I go from here? This feels like a huge deal for me right now. It feels like my life is changing.



(I left a LOT of detail out about my experience, but only because I have NO way of describing it without it being a disjointed incoherent word salad.)



EDIT: I don't really want to talk about the drug. I made this post primarily because I was in awe of how much this subreddit and the information on it are speaking to me in light of this experience.


Edit again: I don't feel like my interest was welcomed. I was downvoted because what led me to look into Buddhism was smoking something instead of consciously deciding, ""Well, seeing as how I've been an aspiritual athiest for years now, I ought to sit down for 20 minutes and think about the innate suffering in life."" Should it really matter HOW I was brought towards learning about the Buddhist teachings, just so long as I was at all, especially since life is constantly changing, people are always experiencing new things, and things are happening in new ways.

The key role of emotions in letting go of attachment,"This explanation relies on you knowing correctly what attachment is, so I will explain it first:

When we say someone is attached to something isn't because he carries it, but rather because he can't let it go. Making this difference is crucial. Here's an example: *A mail man carries a package which is very heavy to it's destination, when he arrives, he tries to leave it but he finds he's been glued to it, so when he leaves it on the ground he rises it up again with him, and he's very unhappy because he can't leave the package where it belongs.*

In this example, the mailman is ourselves, the package is anything we can hold: family, love, money, even our life... Everything that doesn't accompany ourselves after we die can be the package (whether you choose to believe there's somewhere to go after life or not, it's your choice). And the location is where we must leave this thing we are attached to; if it's our family, we must leave them when we have to make decisions by ourselves or when we have to create our own family, for example, if it's money, we must leave it when we are hurting ourselves and others, if it's love we must leave it when we are hurting the other person or are hurting ourselves.  Again, whatever you carry, be it money, family, love, fashion, pleasure, melancholy , anything, even things you consciously know are attachments themselves... It's ok to carry it, as long as you can leave them when you must.

I hope you understood attachment, if you have questions you might ask in comments. 

Now, if that is clear, we must understand what causes attachment to be able to let go of all attachments.

An attachment happens when we are overrun by one emotion, thus by this saturation, the other emotions seem to disappear and we seek to perpetuate this state. Actually all emotions are always there (in potential of being experienced) but since we seek to perpetuate this state we ignore the chances we have to experience them.

The next logical question would be ""why we seek to perpetuate this"". The answer is: because it's comfortable, and comfort is ego wanting to perpetuate itself as it is now. Explaining it a bit further: Since all material things face change one day or another anything (again, material) that attempts to perpetuate itself immobile (or immutable) will begin to face decay when change happens. Thus, ego must always destroy itself and rebuild itself, in this particular way (too) ego doesn't exist, since each time you look it's always something different. But ego is a whole different subject.

So, going back a few steps, the reason, or rather, the happening that causes attachment to happen is being overrun by one emotion, thus choosing to be blind to the other emotions. So, the solution of attachment would be quite simple: Seeking other emotions. But some times it's not like that so I'll explain a bit further.

We seek happiness in our lives, and particularly in buddhism like seeking to be ""white"". In what sense? We seek to be white while illusorily thinking that white is a color on it's own, we think this because we see always the result, not the process. Since white isn't made of ""white"", like blue is made of blue, which is indivisible into other colors, white is made of all the colors mixed in the same amount. By this example, happiness isn't aiming to be happy, but rather experiencing every emotion in the same amount as our choices lead us to experience them, without ever lingering in one and allowing it to overcome our will, of course unless we chose to (which in such case, it isn't overcoming our will). We usually avoid emotions like anger, sadness and anxiety, but these emotions are all part of the cycle, and we can't ignore them if we want to be happy and free.

Going back to the subject, we can't seek other emotions since now we want to preserve this emotional state and we are in samsara. We hold a problem inside us so *we must give it a solution*. All problems must be solved in our mind, or else they will haunt us.

In this there are two cases:

- If the problem can be solved, the solution is facing the problem, which will lead to experiencing the emotion further, then experiencing a new emotion.

- If it can't, which then would mean it's somebody else's problems since only the problems that are not our own can't be solved by ourselves... Then we must accept that we can't solve it, learn and simply forget about it.

In these ways we will release ourselves from the emotions and thus allow ourselves to jump to the next one, never attaching to one emotion, cycling thru all of them, thus being ""white"" or happy. I hope this was clear.

That was the long explanation, the short one is: live in the present, altho not throwing away your future.

Hope you found this useful.

How should a Buddhist fall asleep?,"The only way I can fall asleep normally is to 'turn-off' my Buddhism.  Go back to automatron and stop mindfulness, stop awareness and breathing meditation.  

I would not sleep for days if I continued to be 'fully' Buddhist.

What happens if I don't turn off is I will eventually meditate into a trance, and then into a semi lucid state, where maybe I'll fall asleep but more likely blast into an out of body experience.  This SUCKS because it is very uncomfortable.

So my question is for experienced Buddhists, on falling asleep.  Techniques / Tips much appreciated.

Is secular Buddhist identity - Thoughts,"I know we've had some discussion on the impact of secular Buddhism on Buddhist discourse a few days ago, and I'd like to take a slightly different angle of reflection: is the Secular Buddhist identity a coherent one? I would argue no through a series of reflective exercises:

**Definitions of words** ***can't work for 'everyone'***

Claiming that the term *Buddhist* needs to be inclusive (of atheists, materialists etc), is illogical, since one of the functions of a noun, is to ***delineate*** an object in the world ***from other objects/phenomena***. This makes *productive communication possible*. 

So when we say *Buddhist,* we mean a member (nominal or otherwise) of the Buddhist religion. *So we know immediately*, by the use of that term, ***we are not talking*** about: Atheists, Quakers, or Salafi Muslims or Santeria devotees etc. 

The term Buddhist, if it is to remain a ***coherent*** term, *must exclude*, those who are *not* Buddhist.

Now we know from previous threads, secular Buddhist ideologues have time and again, made their commitments to atheistic, scientistic materialism very clear: ***by their own conviction and insistence***. 

So the plea that they *also be seen* as a ""type"" of Buddhist is incoherent and schizophrenic.  

**So who is a Buddhist?** 

Well, Lord Buddha had a very [succinct answer](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an08/an08.025.kuma.html) to this: 

>""Venerable sir, in what way is one a lay follower?""  
>  
>""Mahanama, inasmuch as one has gone to the Buddha for refuge, has gone to the Dhamma for refuge, has gone to the Sangha for refuge; in that way, Mahanama, one is a lay follower.""

And today in 2022, this formula of Refuge remains part of all devotional practices, *regardless of school.* Buddhists in Myanmar, Tibet, Japan and Indonesia ***do not share*** language, culture or diet, but what they do share, is that Refuge formula (and an array of other practices and precepts).

So Buddhists *can be identified* not by (what are by now) nebulous concepts like: ""mindfulness"" or ""meditation"", but by ***their commitment*** *(nominal or otherwise)* ***to the Three Jewels/Triple Gem***.

In other words, *where you place your faith* determines if you're a Buddhist or not.

**""But no one owns the word Buddhism!""**

The issue really has nothing to do with ownership (a red herring), but with *coherence and harm*. 

Like many Buddhists have said in last weeks thread, perpetuating the idea that atheistic materialists/sceptics are Buddhists (when they say they are) has an impact on historically Buddhist communities, particularly those in settler colonial states (like the US and Australia). 

And by insisting that Buddhism is a ""non-religion"" (another outdated, nonsensical claim), *actual Buddhists can be denied their rights to religious liberty/recognition*.

So claiming you're Muslim when you're not,  (and speaking over actual Muslims) is harmful to Muslims, the same goes for Buddhists.

""**But I can call myself what I want!""**

Yes you can :) But that right *runs both ways*: based on the precedent of 2600 years, ***I also get to respond*** to claims about identity, as it pertains to my religious tradition. A wise black women once said: ""If the glove can't be worn *both ways*, the entire enterprise is a sham.""

""**But you're persecuting me!""**

The hyperbole: I find it especially delicious when secular Buddhist ideologues invoke (mistranslated) suttas to appeal to ""logic and reason"", but when Buddhists seek to test their various claims (through our established epistemologies), we've somehow set up an inquisition to ""persecute"" them. 

This is a huge red flag for me personally, since uncharacteristically for ""Buddhists"", they're pleading for their ideas ***not to be scrutinised*** (under threat of being called a zealot of course!)

\-------------

Ladies and gents, I think as the pressure continues to mount (I'll do my bit in that department) around this issue, we will see many largely abandon the unskilful use of the label *Buddhist*. More and more people are now better educated around the orientalism and fetishisation that lies at the foundations of this strange ideology.

Secular Buddhism is starting to age as badly as those old Judd Apatow movies from the 2000s. It just feels outdated, when you look at how far we've come in globalising Buddhist discourse here.",Buddhism,1665913179.0,t3_y5co8r,0.6,8
A closer look at Secular Buddhism and Cultural Appropriation,"Hi guys, so I have another article on Secular Buddhist movement. I'll share it here in its entirety for comments/discussion. Thanks!

Full article below:

As part of my series in critiquing the Secular Buddhist movement, I thought it worthwhile to take a deeper look at the phenomenon of cultural appropriation, by taking a look at how we define culture. One of the claims of the Secular Buddhist movement is that culture can be separated from ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù. Now, let‚Äôs begin by having a look at the definition of culture and cultural appropriation and see whether this particular feat is possible.

For my analysis, I‚Äôll look at two definitions of the word ‚Äúculture‚Äù as listed in the [Oxford Learners Dictionaries](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/culture_1):

Definition one states that culture is/are: *the customs and beliefs, art, way of life and social organization of a particular country or group.*

Definition four states that culture is/are: *the beliefs and attitudes about something that people in a particular group or organization share.*

For the definition of cultural appropriation, I‚Äôll be using an article from [NCCP.org](https://nccp.org/):

**Cultural Appropriation:** *‚ÄúTaking intellectual property, traditional knowledge, cultural expressions, or artifacts from someone else's culture without permission. This can include unauthorized use of another culture's dance, dress, music, language, folklore, cuisine, traditional medicine, religious symbols, etc. It's most likely to be harmful when the source community is a minority group that has been oppressed or exploited in other ways or when the object of appropriation is particularly sensitive, e.g. sacred objects.‚Äù* (Who Owns Culture? Appropriation and Authenticity in American Law; Susan Scafidi)

So we can see that: cultural appropriation refers to a phenomenon where dominant groups can change the very meanings of the cultural capital of other non-dominant groups and thereby marginalising the source community.

Now, let‚Äôs look at some claims in the FAQ section from the [Secular Buddhism website](https://secularbuddhism.org/faq/). I‚Äôve placed the entire section on appropriation here, and as you will see, problematic ideas around culture become immediately apparent, when placed alongside the Oxford Learners Dictionaries definition:

>2.We reject the appropriation of Asian/Diasporic culture/s as part of engagement with the Dhamma  
You will see many references to separating the Dhamma from specific Asian/Diasporic cultures.

Given the dictionary definition of culture, one has to wonder in what way is separation of ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù from Asian/Diasporic culture (or say any other culture) even possible? If my point is not immediately apparent, allow me to tug at this particular conceptual thread a bit more:

If definitions one and four apply to all human communities, it stands to reason that culture is an inevitable by-product of all these human communities, whether religious or secular. So then again, the question is, how is it possible that a separation of ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù is possible from culture?

For this to be possible, the following phenomenon should be scientifically observable and demonstrable:

1. That certain groups of humans are devoid of culture,
2. which puts them in a position to extract ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù from another group of humans who have a culture.

If that is the claim, then we must ask, how do these humans attain the state devoid of culture? Is there some facet of their development that renders them thus? Could it be linked their ‚Äúsecular‚Äù worldview? If so, how does the secular worldview render these humans immune to generating culture, as defined in the Oxford Learners Dictionary? Would it not make more sense to claim that ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù moves ‚Äì through the concerted effort of individuals and groups ‚Äì from one cultural context to another?

So in my view, the claim that ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù is separable from culture, is not only impossible as an ontological claim, but also obscures the implicitly religious claim: that ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù is a set of transcendent truths that exist outside of time, space and culture and that it can be extracted/mined from those who remain mired in culture.

At this point, we can see that we‚Äôve moved far from a ‚Äúsecular‚Äù worldview to an explicitly religious one. This is a particularly curious position for the Secular Buddhist movement to hold. Is Secular Buddhism even a secular movement at it‚Äôs foundation? If the claim is yes, given the claims about culture and Dhamma above, what renders it so? Surely it can‚Äôt hinge on the existence of devas and rebirth etc, since many Heritage Buddhism(s) place little to no emphasis on these phenomena.

>Unfortunately, these are often read as attacks on those cultures; it is claimed that this separation is due to an aversion to these cultures or as a preliminary step to appropriation. Truthfully, some of the confusion is our fault.

Actually, as far as I can tell, this has not been the claim at all. The claim has been, that existing Buddhist traditions have been subject to the colonial gaze, framing these traditions as a degeneration of a pure unadulterated version located in the distant past. In fact, Western, normative narratives/histories of ‚ÄúBuddhism‚Äù, are essentially those of degeneration and contamination. This is why we still see the widespread misunderstanding of Vajrayana and Mahayana Pure Land teachings as ‚Äúlater‚Äù, degenerate forms of a ‚Äúpurer‚Äù form of Buddhism.

This Western, colonial gaze continues to frame living Buddhist traditions as simply collections of moribund rituals and superstitions. And that ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù can be extracted, to be spirited off to lands where humans have no culture, to forever exist there in pristine glory, far from the mindless religious and superstitious masses.

However, many non-Asian Buddhists continue to practice Buddhism(s) in their traditional forms while applying creative innovations to reach people from other cultural milieus. This makes perfect sense, as the task in rendering ‚ÄúBuddhism‚Äù intelligible to others, will require cross-cultural understanding, religious literacy and most basic of all, that Buddhist ideas ‚Äì in this process ‚Äì are shifting/moving from one cultural context to another.

>We haven‚Äôt been able to find the right words to express ourselves. (However, we‚Äôre going to try here and now:)  
The opposite is actually true. We do not wish to appropriate these cultures with our practice of the Dhamma. For those of more European descent, this prevents a repetition of historical harms.

If this is the case, my recommendations would be the following:

1. Redress of the historical harms that have been done to heritage Buddhists,
2. acknowledging that cultural adaptation and exchange is actually what should be happening
3. Disavow ‚Äì in theory and practice ‚Äì the harmful idea that ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù can be separated from cultures

>For those of more BI/POC descent, this allows us to engage with the Dhamma without dealing more harm to our already harmed (by Imperialism) cultures (i.e. there is a responsibility to uphold our own cultures to combat harm to those cultures that the adoption of Heritage Buddhist forms can interfere with).

Once again, the same misunderstanding is repeated here. The issue for Heritage Buddhists, is not that ‚Äúpeople from one culture should not participate in the culture of another‚Äù. That position, is not only impossible, but is in fact a straw man of the phenomenon of cultural appropriation, largely perpetuated by those who refuse to intellectually engage with these issues and cast negative aspersions on Heritage Buddhists who raise concerns they deem valid.

>And for Asian/Diasporic Secular Buddhists specifically, this allows practice of forms that are not specific to their specific ethnicity without similar issues around appropriation and harm to the practitioner‚Äôs culture (i.e. a person of Thai heritage could explore elements of Zen without issues that might otherwise arise).

The example above is logically unsound, as Zen Buddhism, is very much the historical contribution of Chinese Buddhists. Chinese cultural engagement with Indic ideas, literally gave the world the basis of the Zen traditions we know today. Again, people of different cultures sharing practices is not the definition of cultural appropriation.

>This is why we seek a separation of specific cultures from the Dhamma ‚Äì to prevent appropriation and to facilitate access to the Dhamma by those of BI/POC descent (who otherwise may have to choose between the Dhamma and healing their cultures) ‚Äì and NEVER as a form of erasure.

As the reader can see above, once again, the magical claim is made regarding separating the dhamma from specific cultures.

>The Asian/Diasporic peoples who started and maintained (i.e. transmitted) Buddhist Forms for millennia, allowing for Secular Buddhism to eventually arise ‚Äì our Dhamma ancestors ‚Äì have our deep and explicit gratitude for that and always have. (And, again, part of that gratitude is making sure that we do NOT harm cultures with appropriation as part of our practice of the Dhamma.)

Here we can see a carefully crafted paragraph meant to give the reader the impression that the secular Buddhist movement is simply another school of Buddhism. I will not delve into the doctrinal issues (in this article at least) that make the above claim problematic. I will say, that from the authors point of view, the Secular Buddhist movement seems to require this association, to position themselves as legitimate heirs to the extant Buddhist traditions that have their wellspring in Asia.

The fact that a vast (and growing number) of Buddhists (regardless of heritage), by and large do not recognise them as such, should make us pause and reflect on what is actually being peddled as Buddhist Dhamma ‚Äúwithout culture‚Äù. It is the authors opinion, that **the Secular Buddhist movement is ‚ÄúBuddhist‚Äù only in so far as association with an ‚ÄúAsian religion‚Äù can add legitimacy and orientalist mystique to their particular quasi-religious movement**.

So, to some up: the claim that ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù can be separated from cultures **renders the cultural biases of those engaged in this magical process invisible**. It renders *their assumptions* of what constitutes ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù and what does not, opaque. **Who** gets to decide what constitutes the ‚Äúcore‚Äù of a tradition and what cultural conditioning is at play when making these decisions?

Buddhists, heritage or not, should be willing to engage this movement with the difficult questions it repeatedly refuses to answer. Secular Buddhists continue to build institutions, invoking the name of a world religion, of which they claim to be ‚Äì simultaneously ‚Äì members and secular detractors of. This astounding position makes perfect sense if one factors in cultural appropriation, driven by materialist, scientistic, capitalist concerns and reinforced by [orientalism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Orientalism), a form of racial essentialism.

99% sure I've attained to Stream Entry AMA!,"Hi all at /r/Buddhism!

First off, I've decided to write this purely to stir things up a little - to convince people as best I can that SE is possible in this very life, and not after spending years living in Tibetan caves either! 

How I did it/my meditation history: I began meditating in late 2009, so less than 4 years ago. Back then I practised very irregularly - maybe once or twice a week IIRC. I will say that I did seem to always have quite an appetite for meditation even at such an early stage. I think I pretty much always practised in hour-long sessions, not without difficulty, but my point being there was some natural aptitude towards still-sitting, solitude and introspection. 

For over two years I devoted myself to practicing samatha, with my goal being the first jhana. It wasn't bloody easy. There were many, many disappointing sits and times where I was forced to change tack, realising that you don't just brute force your way beyond a light first jhana, which was the furthest I could get, using a forced-breathing technique (no doubt millenia-old) that I discovered. 

What really pointed me in the right direction (though I believe could easily have sent me on a years-long sort of fool's errand, based on what I've read of other people's accounts) was a ten-day Goenka retreat I did around April of last year. This left me convinced that a return to unforced breathing was the only way forward samatha-wise, and also in retrospect was when I first crossed the 'Arising and Passing Away' stage of Mahasi Sayadaw's progress of insight map. I spent that summer practising samatha two hours a day, figuring that a solid grounding in concentration practice would give me the best chance of landing Stream Entry in daily life (I was not prepared or able to drop out of normal life to do it, though of course there were many times when I wished I could). 

The effects of the 'dark night' or 'knowledges of suffering' stages also started to set in. This involved a slow, steady descent into complete anhedonia (something I'm still living with to this day), accompanied with regular low moods, apathy, strong aversion, loss of connection with emotions (though I do wonder if some of these are unrelated and simply the result of my life being unusually difficult as the latter of these also remains with me) and a general sense of everything I thought I could rely upon/cling to was crumbling apart in my hands ‚Äì a real process of purification, of being left with nothing but oblivion, and in the end wanting nothing more than to surrender to it.

The anhedonia I think played an especially important, and probably helpful, role as I think I may have being getting jhana by late summer and simply not realizing, though it could also have simply been a very strong pre-jhana ‚Äòaccess concentration‚Äô. Either way I‚Äôll take a brief detour here to explain what worked for me in finally making substantial/lasting progress in samatha:

* Incorporating mindfulness into my sits. This is enormously important. At this point I see it as one of the two key aspects of success in samatha, the other being mental stillness.
* Developing a mind ‚Äòinclined to abandoning‚Äô ‚Äì realizing that ‚Äòyou‚Äô don‚Äôt ‚Äòdo‚Äô jhana. It‚Äôs entirely a process of letting go, making less and less effort. Ideally I think the mind should be allowed to naturally sort of reset to attention on the breath, not be pulled back there. Though I‚Äôm aware that it‚Äôs also not about never doing anything. Maximum effiency for me then (post-SE it‚Äôs a whole different ballgame) involved knowing when to allow the ‚Äòdoer‚Äô to step in and make a slight tweak, say to re-establish mindfulness if it had become dulled, or change the width of attention‚Ä¶
* Finding a width of attention that worked for me. That meant focusing on the sensations that made up my head generally, and especially those of mental movement and concentration. This I think is especially powerful as a kind of positive-feedback reinforcement loop is created where the more one concentrates, the more one has to notice. It also helps sustain the benefits of the following‚Ä¶
* Taking a few seconds to objectify/see the three characteristics in sensations of my head and temporarily root-out the sense of self or centerpoint, really helping to speed up the solidification as otherwise the self can start to panic and squirm as concentration encroaches on it.

With all of these employed my early-jhana/access concentration could be really ramped up so that by Christmas I was getting super-intense mental solidification where the five hinderances were totally stamped out through the sheer brunt of concentration. Then over three days I went from a very obvious and sustainable first jhana, to the first four the day after, to all eight the day after that, albeit these were still quite light and wouldn‚Äôt qualify by Ajahn Brahm‚Äôs and a lot of people‚Äôs definitions of jhana, and five to eight may not qualify by less-strict standards either as they weren‚Äôt truly formless ‚Äì I could still sense my body, hear and think, etc. But they did clearly align with the names of ‚Äòboundless space‚Äô, ‚Äòneither perception nor yet non-perception‚Äô etc., so I do consider them valid attainments.

By January of this year the dark night was really hitting hard, or maybe my ability to endure it was wearing thin. I started ruthlessly investigating reality around then mainly out of desperation. There was no formal meditation technique involved that I‚Äôm aware of ‚Äì I couldn‚Äôt abide the idea of starting from scratch with some new technique I think (body-scanning from what I‚Äôd read wasn‚Äôt effective for getting path). So maybe once a week, usually at my lowest ebb, I would try to unravel the sense of a centerpoint. This involved:

* Pretending I was in the stage of ‚Äòequanimity regarding formations‚Äô (and indeed this often left me there) and trying to be as inclusive as I could in objectifying the sensations that made up reality for me, really hitting at the false sense of duality until all seemed to become one and the centerpoint was part of it.
* Riding the jhanic arc up to ‚Äòeighth‚Äô and residing there as long as I could, trying to attain ‚Äòhard‚Äô jhana as best I could, stewing in fourth jhana‚Ä¶ doing anything I thought would boost concentration, then beginning the investigation.
* Pretending the observer was outside looking in, pretending an arrow or bullet was being shot right through my skull, destroying my self.
* Seeing bodily sensations as not just not self, but not me at all ‚Äì more like any other object. This was an important turning point I think.

What I believe helped me get there:

* A strong (though not exceptional or anything) intuition that was always running in the background during meditation, throwing up insights.
* A thorough clobbering from the dark night until as I said I wanted nothing more than oblivion ‚Äì in other words, I was a little bit suicidal.
* Not obsessing over dissolving coarse sensations until the body was entirely vibrating particles, as Goenka would have you do, but having confidence that I was seeing the impermanence, suffering and not-self in everything anyway.
* Hanging out on forums like the DhO and Kenneth Folk dharma where attainments are discussed openly and there‚Äôs a strong message that this can be done by lay people in years, not decades.
* Having the self-knowledge to focus on concentration over dry insight, knowing that my awareness doesn‚Äôt naturally flit quickly from one thing to another, etc.
* Realising that the three characteristics apply just as completely post-SE as pre. Getting to a point where I only wanted to attain this in order to better help others. Thinking my way out of the trap of anticipation of path.

So I kept this up for about 3 months, practicing samatha daily and vipassana once or twice a week. Then, early this month, feeling thoroughly fed up with everything one night and turning to vipassana for an hour or so before going to bed, I was laying there in bed ‚Äì I say I but at this point there was no I, just a mass of atoms not anticipating or doing anything or locating themselves on any map ‚Äì when I decided to focus on bodily sensations, remembering that Goenka advised doing this while on retreat (I think?). After I believe no more than a few seconds of this, just beginning to relax after a long day, there was a sudden, bright flash of light and a discontinuity - not exactly pleasant, probably entrance through a suffering door ‚Äì followed by a shower of warm, tingling sensations through my head. No pleasure of course due to the anhedonia. 

I don‚Äôt think I jumped to conclusions but just laid there. It was anticlimactic. But very soon I started to cycle and before I went to sleep I must have completed four or five cycles through nanas 4 to 12, then 15. It did seem to be nana 16, the ‚Äòreview‚Äô stage, though I was still skeptical. The following two weeks saw the following, which left me convinced:

* Regular cycling that sped up when I stopped to pay close attention to it.
* A sudden increase in samatha skills ‚Äì I can now simply drop ‚Äì not do much of anything ‚Äì and end up in jhana. Indeed the cycling meant I was only seconds off a light jhana.
* A jump in perceptual ability ‚Äì seeing vibrations in equanimity in daily life without even trying. Easily dissolving blind areas where I struggled before.
* A transparency and increased sense of things unfolding as they always have. Just a general reduced sense of there being a self at the controls of this body.
* An increase in intelligence, or maybe just a return to my pre-dark night intelligence level, which was so long ago I‚Äôve almost forgotten what I was like then.
* Much-reduced feelings of craving and aversion towards anything.
* Much-reduced capacity to become even slightly irritated or stressed out by anything.
* ‚Ä¶in other words, a quite significant reduction in general suffering that makes it all worthwhile.
* I believe reproducible fruitions are also a sure sign, though not diagnostic. I‚Äôve found them tough, though not impossible, as all sense of self and doer needs to be completely out of the picture for them to happen.

I write these in the past tense because I‚Äôve since begun a new progress of insight for second path, so it‚Äôs all died down a bit and gotten confusing as to which nana I‚Äôm in.

Ok, so maybe I‚Äôve just answered most of the questions people would be interested in asking me. If you have any left, I‚Äôd be glad to field them!

Is cheating always BAD KARMA and wrong?,"  

Hi,

Is cheating always BAD KARMA and wrong?

I and this girl I like started getting physically intimate recently and she is in a relationship. Now this is cheating I understand. But I wanted to understand if with added context, is it still wrong or is it less wrong or something.

She has had emotionally abusive and in general bad relationships especially with one ex trying to commit suicide when she wanted to break up with him. 

About a year back she met this guy whom she liked and within a few months of meeting once a month physically\[rest of the times on phone\], the guy‚Äôs father died and he begged her to commit to the relationship because he really needs it right now and she did. Since then it has turned into this unhealthy thing of him trying to control her and tell her how she should feel, and to make her talk to his mother for long durations in which the mother \[who is a psychologist by the way\] would vent out her life‚Äôs troubles on this girl for hrs sometimes. She has difficulty saying no due to various reasons and just tries to not confront and can‚Äôt deal with her boyfriend getting angry and shouting and is v afraid that he will self harm if she ends things and doesn‚Äôt want to be the cause of that.

I know talking to her that she doesn‚Äôt want to be in the relationship but she really cant confront or take any decision right now in the midst of studies and all. She wants to be physical and close with me. But she said that she really cant end things right now. I know she doesn‚Äôt secretly talk to him or anything, she just gets scared by him and his mother and tries to talk just enough to avoid them or avoid being shouted or guilted at. My bonding with this girl is something I really cherish. I have been honest with her that this is unhealthy and she says she understand but needs time, she cant bring herself up to end things right now.

Now I am caught up in a dilemma. Should I stop being physical with her, is it wrong even with the above context? Or should I continue being close with her because we have a good bond and she is like a healing presence for me, the first one for me till date. Am I generating bad karma for myself being with this girl sexually?

I apologise in advance if this is v na√Øve and things are obvious, this is my first time being close with any girl.

Thank you for reading till now:)

Rock Bottom,"I came to Pattaya (which is the world's biggest brothel) in Thailand to enjoy the girls, but I ended up hitting rock bottom, alone in my hotel room crying. Not because I was lonely or was rejected. I had all the fun and sex I expected. Money will literally fullfil your wildest sexual fantasy ever imagined. And you will not understand what lengths mankind do to satisfy themselves.

I always refuse/try to ignore the Noble truths, because I refuse to give up what I have and what I will have. However I cannot turn a blind eyes to what I experienced next.

Yestersay, I took a cheap bar girl to my hotel, let's call her Fern, as the night progressed, we had a lot of fun together. But at the same time, I learned to know about the guys Fern slept with and how her life is being a bar girl. Eventually I understood that even though she's is 27, her mental age is like 17 and is used by men of all ages as a sex toy including me, stringed by promise of money and especially the promise of true love. For example she tells me about the guys who started out as her lover but then started beating her, but she endured in the hope of he being the one. You can literally see a life devoid of love and full of exploitations. But who would ever love a bar girl? So do I, I only wanted Fern for the holes she has. I never believe in love anyway (love often blinds people). So I gave her the money, she leave in sadness of separation and I go mongering for other beautiful prostitutes.

Fast forward to today, I spend around 700 bucks having a blast at various brothels. I had the blast of my life, I saw hundred of amazingly sexy girls stripping throughout the day. I used some prostitutes to what ever I fantasized. Most of them did not like it but do it because of financial needs. But who cares right? I know they didn't like it but I ignore what they feel anyway. In the mean time, Fern, the girl I used last night, started to posting statuses about how fucked love is which I immediately know is about me. Even thought I paid her, we had genuine fun and did really connected but I ditched her and listened to my dick like always. At last I took another girl home and used her until I no longer can and kicked her out of the hotel.

 Then the reality started sinking in. This have been in the back of my mind for the whole time but I wanted to turn a blind eye to it. I started to realize how serious the suffering of these prostitutes I used. They are mostly young girls employed by bars aimed to roll in as much money to the owner as possible. They will do whatever degrading things you wanted, if you give them money. Call me a hypocrite, but if you ask me how bad the future of these girls will be, I would say they have no future. I started to realize that these girls have hopes and dreams, just like I do. That Fern the bar girl also has hopes and dreams, she wanted to have a confidence, well off foreign guy like me (I can be quite charming to girls and manipulative as well). But the difference between me and her is, my future has a chance of success, I will be wealthy, will marry a beautiful wife, and hers has none. She will spend every single day in her life dreaming about a good husband while being used by men like me until the day she turns old and discarded by society. I don't blame her, to survive here is tough and selling your body can make you decent money.

I started crying. The great but short fun I have with these prostitutes is over, but what will remain after that? Fern is literally the result of countless exploitations, which I AM THE CREATOR OF ONE. While I was enjoying the new girl, Fern was once again grieving about a guy she connected with ditching her again, and have once again learned that it is best to not falling in love being a prostitute. 

I feel so heartless. It makes me feel sickened how I did the same thing with other girls, only using them for their bodies. I am stuck in a cycle of continuously creating sufferings while seeking for pleasures and her in an endless cycle of suffering while providing it. And the roles shall be swapped.

Why was I born with such an insane sexual desire that I have to do these kind of things? I am so conflicted. I am selfish in nature, I won't abandon my needs but at the same time, I can no longer turn a blind eye, especially to the one you have connected and choose to ignore but you can't. I tried to enjoy the girls and drink a bit to ignore the problem, but I can't.

I hope that was my lesson. That I have had enough and end that cycle. I do not want to see girls like Fern suffering anymore. And me suffering because of the unfulfillment of my desire.

I think I loved Fern, she is only an innocent girl. However, I know money is not the solution, I will not sponsor her and sends money to Thailand like many foreign men do with the hope to wife her.  I still have a few days with her and I will be gone forever. I will pay her the cheap daily price, while at the same time broaden her knowledge about what I know about the world, taking her to go do charities with me, and to the temples. I hope with this she can get out of this cycle by her own. After those days I will not be back.

I know there will be still some of my selfish motives with Fern's body. That is the conflict. But I can inspire her, even as a lover for a short time. I truly want good for her too, that I will not lie.

But im afraid do I have high hopes?
Would it create more suffering as I once again lead her on? Would it fall on deaf ears? Should I just focus on my own actions first?

"Banned from /r/Buddhism for quoting one of the mod's (Bobba Phet) malicious private messages. Some of Bobba's words: ""Fuck off asshole ignorant fuck face""
","I was recently debating (that is being generous with the nature of the discussion) one of the mods here in a thread about a shakespeare quote. 

He originally went back and deleted only the spiteful responses, but now I see he has gone back and deleted all of them. IDK if mods can see deleted comments, but I know at least one other board member (lvl_5_laser_lotus) saw some of the comments as I discussed them a bit with him (http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/y5w3x/awakening_and_psychedelic_drugs/c5topoi). Like I said there, I really was trying not to make this a big deal - I don't want Bobba Phet to feel unwelcome here. At the same time, when I see him making others feel unwelcome because they are drug users (which I am as well, and I refuse to be made to feel badly about it by anyone but myself), I just can't abide that - when someone sees he is a mod, and look at his comment karma, they may assume he is an authority on Buddhism. He is not - or at least not in any kind of Buddhist practice. His own words are all the proof one needs. 

And so when I see him disparaging people for exploring their mind with substances, I feel the need to raise the counterpoint ""Hey this guy clearly doesn't know what he's talking about, he is not practicing what he is preaching"" by quoting the private messages he sent me after our discussion on the Shakespeare quote. I don't want him banned - I just feel very strongly that he should not be a moderator. If nothing will be done about this, then I'm going to stop coming here. I know that probably doesn't mean anything to any of you, but it means something to me. There are few places in real life, much less the internet where you can have thoughtful discussion without it devolving into petty arguments. I thought this was one such place, but apparently as it sits I was wrong. 

I fully admit, that towards the end of the original thread that spawned all this, I lost my patience a bit, and made some condescending/insulting statements. But you'll just have to take my word that it is a fraction the vitriol that was being spewed at me which was being reflected in my statements. 

Which is not an excuse, but rather some context. And like I said in the thread, I'm not really ashamed of any of it, and that is why it is still there - Bobba Phet cannot say the same of his comments. 

Anyways here is the full exchange of private messages which took place, the posting of which prompted my being banned. (posting in first comment reply because it's too long)


Hopefully it will result in something other than this account being banned. If you have any questions feel free to message me at my main account - sh3rog. Unfortunately I cannot post here under that identity.

It's a good thing identity is meaningless

**EDIT**

So bobbaphet (or another mod IDK honestly the mods seem to be in collusion a bit in my opinion, given that Bobba had to notify them about my banning)

I personally believe the Buddha was a man of integrity who spoke with his actions and led by example.

excuse while I don my Hardliner hat.

""Check the Sidebar"" has to be the laziest, BS answer anyone can give when somebody comes here, asking questions about Buddhism.

to me, ""Check the Sidebar"" says that the commenter does not give enough of a shit to provide an actual answer. It indicates nothing, it says nothing. 

When somebody asks you for advice within your realm of knowledge, do you say: ""I don't care enough to answer, ask somebody else""? When somebody needs help from you , do you tell them that you don't care enough to share your own experience?

THAT's what I see when ""Check the Sidebar"" comes up. Instead of a column of resources that we could pick out in order to answer a question, it has become a crutch that further breaks our legs. I am not advocating that we remove it, but I do not believe that it exists so that people don't have to think about their answers.

When any Lama, Roshi, or what-have-you gives a Dharma talk, they're not just reciting some party lines, or beleaguering a go-to sutra, they are necessarily sharing their experience, and that's all they can do. Otherwise they may as well all say ""Check the Sidebar"" and wash their hands of helping anybody. 

All this talk about compassion and it seems that some don't care enough to give a response a full ten minutes of their time and effort. I don't care if you hate what I'm saying, as long it gets stuck in your head, and forces you to reflect before vomiting out that same tired crap.

"""Is Buddhism against Birth Control?"" (Master Sheng-yen, ""Orthodox Chinese Buddhism"" 3.23)","*3.23 Is Buddhism against Birth Control?*

This issue has yet to be discussed widely in Buddhist circles. In accordance with the basic principles of Buddhism, as long as one does not break the precept against killing a person by having an abortion, there is no reason to oppose birth control. Birth control is moral if it is done to improve the children‚Äôs quality of life and education, or to avoid financial burden.

Abortion is strictly forbidden in Buddhism and is considered equivalent to killing a human being. It does not matter whether the aborted fetus has developed recognizably human features or not; any abortion is the same as killing a person. So Buddhism is opposed to birth control through abortion.

So we need to investigate the various techniques of birth control.

MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhists believe that the intermediate-state body (*zhongyin shen*) (the spirit-body in the stage of existence between death and rebirth) enters into the mother‚Äôs womb while its parents are copulating. Seeing its future parents united, the spirit becomes deluded; if it feels passion for the father, it enters the womb to become a female, and if it feels passion for the mother, it will become a male. It also clings to the father‚Äôs ejaculated sperm and the mother‚Äôs ovum as its ‚Äúself.‚Äù But as we can deduce from embryology, this concept of self should not arise until the ovum is actually fertilized‚Äîthat is, at conception‚Äîwhich does not necessarily occur while the parents are copulating. And this account cannot explain how artificial insemination occurs. So this traditional view must be an explanation that was expedient under certain circumstances.

It follows then, if one wishes to use birth control, it should be done before the sperm fertilizes the ovum in order to avoid abortion, which constitutes killing. It may be moral if prior to sexual intercourse one takes anti-pregnancy pills or installs anti-pregnancy devices and/or medication inside the uterus or vagina. Such treatments will prevent the sperm from reaching the ovum or cause the sperm and eggs to lose their potency. But one must be absolutely sure that one is not killing the fertilized ovum. Otherwise, it‚Äôs best not to use birth control at all, and to instead use the method that Buddhism praises most highly‚Äîto practice sexual restraint.

Meditation and Ableism?,"I'm a very big advocate for disability and I have been practicing Buddhism in the Hu√°y√°n tradition for about three years now.

Recently I've been having second thoughts on meditation as a vessel of enlightenment. As disability studies informs us, not all minds are neurotypical, which is to say that all individuals experience phenomena differently. I have heard a few concerns from autistic individuals about the inability of certain neurologies to meditate (in the traditional practice) and it makes a lot of sense to me that the primacy on particular forms of meditation may be exclusionary of non-neurotypical individuals.

As someone who also believes strongly in Th√≠ch Nh·∫•t H·∫°nh's concept of engaged Buddhism, the coalescence of social justice and disability advocacy is crucial to the path of bodhisattva. This seems to come into direct conflict with the aforementioned primacy on meditation.

A contradiction I've found in Buddhist teachings,"I've been discovering philosophy and different religious traditions for myself for a while. And of course I could not pay no attention to Buddhism. But unfortunately, I've found a contradiction in Buddhist teachings. If one supposes that at least once a while someone reaches the enlightenment then eventually the whole world will do. But according to Buddhism the world is eternal, it passes through loads of cycles. Thus it should not exist now! It's like water passing from one place to another, eventually all the water will be spent. But if from any point the time which has passed is eternity, then from any point the water must not be in the first place. Then we should admit one of those: 1. The world is not eternal. 2. The enlightenment and nirvana are not ultimate and the person having reached it may be returned back to samsara. Well, perhaps it's a false dilemma and other options how to avoid contradiction exist, but I can't think of any. 
I do trust your teachings and I find it one of the most beautiful religions and traditions which emerged throughout the human history; however, I can't solve this contradiction. Could somebody help me?",Buddhism,1395610605.0,t3_216ewd,0.5,0

Is it possible for women to achieve anuttara-samyak-sambodhi?,"
TLDR: is it possible for women to achieve the same feat as Gautama Buddha, anuttara-samyak-sambodhi?

In the 12th chapter of the Lotus Sutra, Longn√º the dragon girl attains enlightenment, but only after first transforming into a man. I'm not sure if she attained anuttara-samyak-sambodhi or another form of enlightenment, but either way she did so in the form of a man.

Many nuns in the Pali Canon achieved enlightenment, but unless I'm mistaken they all became arahants, or ""sravakabuddhas,"" rather than samyaksambuddhas like the Buddha Gautama.

In modern times, the Kagyu nun Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo ""made a vow to attain enlightenment in the female form, no matter how many lifetimes it takes."" Assuming that the enlightenment she is referring to is anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, will it be possible for her to fulfill her vow?

I feel like a lot of people say ""all enlightenment is the same,"" which may be true but seems a little off-topic. The intention with this answer I think is to say there is no difference between a man achieving anuttara-samyak-sambodhi and a woman achieving sravakabodhi or pratyekabodhi, but my question is whether a woman can achieve anuttara-samyak-sambodhi like Gautama Buddha did? This answer might also be an oblique way of saying that in fact women cannot achieve anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, but that it's no big deal because the other two are just as good.

If the answer is no, why not?
If the answer is yes, who is a woman who has achieved it?",Buddhism,1701713281.0,t3_18aq4zg,0.47,0

"Hindus and Buddhists view on each other's spirituality, and thoughts about Jesus","Hello,

I was wondering how Hindus and Buddhists (from all sects or denominations) view each other and each other's spirituality and religiosity. Your religions and world views amongst other Asian religions are somehow interconnected, and I'm really curious how they are viewed amongst you as followers.

I'm asking this since I'm taking a broad interest in Asian religions, and I am myself open to the thought of rebirth, karma and meditation. I spend a lot of time reading literature from gurus and about Buddha. I am learning how to meditate, albeit still at the beginning and it's taking time.

You might wonder what tradition I come from, and I come from an Eastern Christian tradition, and I regard and love Jesus Christ highly as an awakened person and a godly messenger. I guess he might be easy to revere from Buddhist and Hindu perspectives? I believe Christians with their religious practice have misunderstood him and his message. I find myself seeing him through new eyes. I would also like to hear common views about that.

Questions I didn‚Äôt get real answer about Buddhism,"Hello all. 
I tried asking these questions in various forums. But usually I was copped out. 
I hope someone who is not a blind fanatic can help me:
1) how far can you be kind? If you are kind to people that harm you or your kin, isn‚Äôt that not right action? On the other hand there was some ruthless killings in mynmar. Which I assume related to defending the Buddhist religion against annexation. 
Also, narcissistic people can take advantage of kind people. And not care or ‚Äúconvert‚Äù to be kind as well. 
I‚Äôm sure all of us had that kind of behaviour upon us, and it‚Äôs very challenging to me how to approach it, as I want to be kind, but I also know it won‚Äôt do him good. Or me. Like a spoiled child that needs educating. If you‚Äôll only care without borders you will get cruel behaviour from him/her. 

2) regarding reaching the highest state of non- rebirth. (The stage where you gained stream entry and you won‚Äôt be reborn again) 
That sounds to me, from what I‚Äôve read, and heard from
Various monks, practitioners is that the current existence isn‚Äôt the ultimate one. 
And here‚Äôs what puzzles me. If you actually reached a stage where nothing harms you mentally, what kind of suffering would you endure? Only physical. But you won‚Äôt suffer really. So what does it matter? Why do you think non rebirth is the best? 
It‚Äôs either nihilistic. Or there‚Äôs something I don‚Äôt understand. From what I know about life in my 48 years of experience, is that resilience is needed, and flexibility, to suffer less. And to absorb more and enjoy life by just existing. Which I found such a huge discovery when I start with Buddhism.",Buddhism,1683045434.0,t3_135t2sh,0.54,1

I'm interested in the more widespread Buddhist beliefs on abortion,"Hello friends, I am a secular Buddhist who has come to my own understanding of the intersection of Buddhism and the modern world. One thing that I am interested in discussing is the topic of abortion.

Tenzin Gyatso has said that he supports abortion in cases which birth would either kill the mother or result in a deformed/""retarded"" child. (I don't know the direct translation of his words, though I'm sure the word he used could mean either or both)

I personally disagree with his thoughts on the child, specifically in the act of denying someone existence solely because they would be born extremely neurodivergent or deformed. I understand what he means and I think that if the child will undoubtedly face a rate of suffering much more than normal that abortion would be considered sparing it then it could very much be used.

As well, I am of the belief that there should be measures taken to hopefully prevent women and trans men from undergoing abortions (such as financial aid, therapy, healthcare), but ultimately it should entirely be the choice of the pregnant person in question. In other words, I'm very strictly pro-choice as long as that choice is well-informed.

Yes, we can still say that some of them who wishes to rewrite buddhism is wrong view, but any tradition of Buddhism who has enlightened ones might be dangerous if one disrespect them.

Still contemplating the implications.  


Edit: Thanks. Good point. Stream enterers are not omniscient. The friends I talked to and have more confidence, they believe in rebirth, but they cannot be sure if all stream winners need to believe in rebirth. ",Buddhism,1640847077.0,t3_rrv4r4,0.54,1

A problem I have with Buddhism.,"Can somebody clarify, in case I am missing something here?

My knowledge of Buddhism is limited, but I struggle to understand how someone can achieve enlightenment and escape the cycle of rebirth. How can you escape rebirth if there is no ""you""?

I found an interest in Buddhism due to my own experiences with non self. I was amazed that there was a philosophy that could explain my experiences in simple terms for me. The only problem is, if there is no self, then how are we supposed to achieve enlightenment? If we are all one, then how can something that believes it is separate from other non  enlightened beings actually be enlightened?",Buddhism,1635855051.0,t3_ql2szi,0.47,0

2. Yogacara: Samsara is nirvana, only our attached and craving awareness keeps us from seeing it. Unattached awareness (the original pure awareness) is nirvana.

Pali Canon: Samsara is not nirvana. Nirvana is a distinct element of reality, Samsara (earth, water, fire, air, space, life, consciousness etc.) are the conditioned and nirvana is the unconditioned, but it exists and exists separately just like anything else. The perception of the nirvana element is the realization of nirvana, a definite state of consciousness is associated with the perception of nirvana (not unlike eye-consciousness or ear-consciousness arises when colors or sounds are perceived, there is nirvana-consciousness when nirvana is perceived).

"""Dark"" Buddhism","**OP edit: dayum, considering this is a Buddhist forum there's some hardcore judgment and downvoting going on. Good job.**

Trying my hardest not to sound like an edgelord here.

So what I've noticed in my ""practice"" (not a normal morality-focused eightfold-path following one) is that there comes a point (years down the line) when the facts of unsatisfactoriness, Impermanence and no-self doctrines are so deeply ingrained in you and felt in your everyday life that psychologically it could be called depersonalisation.

I'm chasing pleasures of all kind (sex, drugs) and observe my desires being quenched and leaving me empty inside immediately afterwards.

I see constant change, flux and impermanence everywhere. This I think is the biggest truth of Buddhism. I realise how attachment to anything is ultimately futile and the only things I attach to are endeavours of pleasure, kinda going along for the ride (can be as innocent as being focused on a TV show until I binge it). Can't attach to people, wouldn't want to anyway, I see most people (and all other animals for that matter), as inherently selfish, temporary bundles of flesh and bone with a disgusting-looking organ in the driver seat.

Don't consider myself an exception in the least.
I also know that our personalities are made up of a constant flow of different emotions and thoughts, utterly meaningless.

Death is final and there is no reincarnation, just as there is no heaven with Jesus or Allah in it. I only believe what I observe and see about life as the Buddha intended.

Now this obviously does free me from a lot of suffering when I let go of attachments. It also, obviously, makes it extremely hard for me to connect with other people and even be emphatetic instead of utterly selfish.

Goodness is only a coping mechanism for inevitable death.,"I've been contemplating my own mortality and the meaninglessness of it all for the last few days. I have especially been curious about how Buddhism seems to avoid this issue and what differentiates it from Existential Nihilism.

Then I found this comment in a zen thread by a deleted account from a year ago:

""When you live for happiness, you fear death. When you live for goodness, you don't need to. Death is an enemy to happiness, but not really an enemy to goodness. I know that's vague but that's the direction I'd point you to, and is probably the extent of my wisdom on the topic!""

From [https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/82x9mb/zen\_and\_the\_fear\_of\_death/](https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/82x9mb/zen_and_the_fear_of_death/)

This brought me to two realizations:

\- living life for your own happiness, whether through pleasures, relationships or accomplishments, is ultimately unsustainable and brings only suffering

\- when you shift the focus from your own happiness to another person, a goal or even the worship of a god or an ideal (such as goodness), it is nothing but a psychological coping mechanism that allows you to reconcile your getting up in the morning with the futility of your impermanent existence.

The original zen/chan masters seem to disregard both theravada and mahayana Buddhism as lesser vehicles, in fact they throw out both good and evil as merely conceptual thought and for them, realizing the unborn Buddha mind equals killing the Buddha and ordinary mind being the Way.

"Karma, Dharma, and Acts of Compassion 101","If you are interested in Buddhism, or any Eastern philosophy/religion for that matter, here are some basics you should know and/or teach.

Karma is a Sanskrit word, and just like any other Sanskrit word it has dozens of definitions. But one of the more practical ones is ‚Äúaction‚Äù. 

On a grander scale it refers to the cosmic law of cause and effect, action and re-action. Everything that occurs on any level in the universe percolates through the mysterious fabric of reality to create a change that must eventually resolve somehow to maintain equanimity. That‚Äôs nice to know and all, but for all intents and purposes it‚Äôs just theory. How does that apply to you personally? 

On a smaller and uniquely individual scale there are three basic types of karma to keep in mind. The first is a sort of ‚Äúprenatal‚Äù karma - this is what brought you to the precise time, place, and circumstances in which you were born on earth. The second is ‚Äúactive‚Äù karma - this is everything that is currently happening to you based on your actions since you were born. And the last type of karma is a little tricky - it is a sort of combination of the first two  and can be thought of as ‚Äúdestiny‚Äù karma, this is karma that will manifest at some point in the future. The trippy part of this one is that it can be altered based on your understanding and eventual manipulation of the law, which is where dharma comes into play.

Dharma, another Sanskrit word with dozens of meanings, essentially means ‚Äúduty‚Äù. Karma and dharma go hand in hand. It is because of karma you are here (again), and it is your duty to understand how to free yourself from subsequent misery-making incarnations. One of the most effective ways to do so is by realizing the true nature of the ‚ÄúSelf‚Äù by sincerely practicing a meditation technique similar to the one taught by Lord Gautama (pranayama and breath control are good places to start). Proper meditation will either help you ride the waves of karma with more ease as they come and eventually cease, or it will ‚Äúroast‚Äù the seeds of karma completely.

And once you master these principles, it is also nice to know the main types of compassionate, or ‚Äúliberating‚Äù, acts that will also help balance the karmic scales in your favor, until you reach the goal of caring about karma no more. In this world of ‚Äúsuffering‚Äù, having inner compassion for others is fine. Doing something about it is better. One can alleviate the suffering of another by three ways (in order of increasing utility) - material, mental, or spiritual. For example, you could give someone money, shelter, clothes, or food - this would help, but wealth such as this depletes. Or you might teach someone a physical skill or a mental tool to help him get along easier in this world. But, most importantly, you could also find ways to give someone lasting peace, such as teaching him how to meditate to the best of your ability or showing him where to learn. This is true spiritual wealth, and it is the kind of wealth that multiplies exponentially as it is passed on. 

The world can never have too much good karma, so let us continue creating it.",Buddhism,1496886228.0,t3_6fxxx4,0.5,0
Have I reached enlightenment?,"Six or so months ago, I was lying in bed on my own late at night. I usually think about various things late at night.

"I think certain drugs (dissociatives) have the potential to Enlighten or liberate you. I've seen the Supreme Self and the Absolute. I've seen the universe/Samsara from ""outside"". These experiences are just as valid as meditative ones. Right?","Different paths to the same place, I feel. 

Last night, I had an M-Hole that felt so spiritual and divine. I had an out of body experience, my ego was nowhere to be found. I was dissociated from my ""self"" and all that was left was pure consciousness and awareness.

Nirvana was perceived as a paradoxical truth about existence and non-existence. Existence is eternal and has always been here and will always be here. Things might go into and out of existence, but existence itself is always there. It makes you question, how is it that something has always been yet never came into being? You also wonder, instead of this reality we experience, why wasn't it just non-existence of all things forever? We know that has never been the case, because if reality never existed and there ""was"" nothingness for eternity... then we wouldn't even be here to question it.

The tricky and paradoxical part is that within existence, there can be non-existence. There can be non-experience. So in a way, even though there was always something here and it was never just eternal nothingness (which has never existed, can't exist by definition) the concept of nothingness has also always existed (within existence, paradoxically). 

The mind realizes that there was always a nothingness and  emptiness that it could attain. Liberation from itself.  It's difficult to express in language, that's why you get statements like ""neither perception nor non-perception."" It's possible for the Mind to detach from experience and be in a state that is neither experience nor non-experience. Nothing coming, nothing going.  

At least, that's how I see things at the moment... it's extremely difficult to express these understandings, words really don't do them justice.

MDMA and enlightenment,"This may just be downvoted into invisibility due to the general anti-drug sentiment in this sub-reddit, but I'll give it a shot.

-----------------------------

Does anyone else think that the MDMA/ecstasy experience is very close to nirvana? For those of us that have never done ecstasy before, let me clear something up: MDMA is *not* rolling around on the ground laughing, as it is portrayed in the media. The main effects are endless happiness, empathy, love, and peace.

When I take MDMA, I have unlimited feelings of peace and love towards all people. I don't act like an idiot like you've seen in movies. I feel as if something has been unlocked inside of me and it's finally spilling out like it always should. Sometimes I will just yell out things like, ""I love all of you! Peace to everyone! I now declare the world a happy place!"" This makes everyone around me happier too, even if they're not rolling.

I know a lot of you have negative reactions once people on here start talking about drugs. I don't think that the Buddha was experiencing an acid/mushroom trip for his whole life. I do feel like what he had was similar to what I experience when I take ecstasy. 

I'm not saying that we should all take ecstasy all the time instead of practicing. However, if you've always wondered what enlightenment is like and what you may be in for if you do awaken, you may want to try out MDMA or its siblings.",Buddhism,1342455259.0,t3_wndji,0.44,0

"Dharma Master Hengyun answers questions about abortion (3/3): ""Should a doctors perform abortions?""","**Question: My relative is an OB/GYN. If a pregnant woman has financial difficulties or already has too many children, is it okay for the doctor to perform the requested abortion?**

Answer:

...

A woman once brought her husband, an OB/GYN, to the temple. He had been diagnosed with cancer and hoped that the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas could help him. He told me that he took good care of his body and exercised everyday to maintain his health. Therefore he had no idea why he still got cancer. Actually, with abortions being so prevalent nowadays, OB/GYNs especially need to be careful. A doctor‚Äôs duty is to save lives, and performing abortions is contrary to this duty. Whatever causes we plant, we reap the corresponding effects. Karma results from our daily actions, while we create a cause only once in a while. Let me give you an example to illustrate these concepts. If we plant seeds in the spring, we need to wait until autumn for the harvests. 

The Brahma Net Sutra‚Äôs Bodhisattva precepts state that ‚ÄúA disciple of the Buddha must not kill by himself, tell others to kill, kill with expedient means, praise killing, or condone killing. He must not use any methods whatsoever, not even mantras, to kill. He must not create any causes for killing, effects of killing, methods of killing, and karma of killing. As long as the being has a life, he must not end its life intentionally.‚Äù ‚ÄúTo kill by oneself‚Äù means not only to take other‚Äôs life, but also to take one‚Äôs own life. ‚ÄúTelling others to kill‚Äù includes advising others to kill or sending someone to kill on your behalf. Whether the act of killing is done by your own hands or by others‚Äô hands because you told them to do so, the offense is the same.

...

During the 1980s, a manager came all the way from Southeast Asia to visit the Venerable Master at CTTB. This man had cancer and hoped the Venerable Master could save him. . .The Venerable Master further asked, ‚ÄúHow about your wife?‚Äù In surprise, the manager answered, ‚ÄúOh, I remember now. I once talked my wife into getting an abortion!‚Äù All the lives he had taken were coming to him and demanding payments. Therefore, if someone asks you whether she should get an abortion, you should advise her against it. Don‚Äôt say things such as, ‚ÄúIf you are in a difficult situation, just get rid of the fetus.‚Äù If you tell someone to get an abortion, it is considered as telling others to kill.

Upholding the precepts creates merit and virtue; breaking the precepts creates negative karma. However, causes and effects exist regardless of whether one has received the precepts. By killing a fetus, one will bear the consequences. I once saw rebirth plaques made by a mother who tried to cross over more than ten fetuses that she had aborted. It was frightening to realize how many lives she was indebted to! Our current ignorance creates a future full of ignorance, and a future full of ignorance causes us to be even more ignorant, thus creating a snowball effect.

I remember being an animal. How is this possible?,"I was a house cat.

According to my owner, my cat body was long dead before my human self was born. With this in mind, was my mindstream always inside my human body since birth, or did I possess someone?
2. How did some of my cat memory survive? If my cat body was dead before my human body was being formed, this must mean that the cat's ability to possess memory was dead too. How could it be, then, that I have those cat memories in my head?
3. Where are the other animal -> human individuals? Early on, I questioned others about their past lives, thinking it was common at first. When I realized it was not, I read stories about people remembering past lives as other humans, but there was never one about an animal life. Am I really that alone?
4. I read that habits can influence where you end up in the next life. I very much want to try and retain some memory of my current or past life for the next one. If I think about my strongest memories moments before death, is there a better chance that those memories will survive? I don't know if my cat self was actively trying to pass memories on - maybe I just got lucky that I could remember something.",Buddhism,1593073933.0,t3_hfik4b,0.63,15
The compassion and wisdom of the herb spirit Auspicious,"Hello r/Buddhism ! Since today is 4/20 (in the U.S at least), I think it would be valuable to show our appreciation and gratitude towards herbs. The following excerpt is from chapter 1 of the Avatamsaka Sutra (The Flower Ornament Scripture). This sutra is vast and the wisdom incredible. I pray this excerpt expresses the great compassion of the Mahayana sutras in liberating all types of sentient beings.
------

Furthermore, the herb spirit Auspicious found the door of liberation observing the mentalities of all sentient beings and striving to unify them. The herb spirit Sandalwood Forest found the door of liberation embracing all sentient beings with light and causing those who see it not to waste the experience. The herb spirit Pure Light found the door of liberation able to annihilate the afflictions of all sentient beings by pure techniques. The herb spirit Universal Renown found the door of liberation able to increase the boundless ocean of good roots by means of a great reputation. The herb spirit Radiant Pores found the door of liberation hurrying to all sites of illness with the banner of great compassion. The herb spirit Darkness Destroying Purifier found the door of liberation able to cure all blind sentient beings and cause their eye of wisdom to be clear. The herb spirit Roarer found the door of liberation able to expound the verbal teaching of the Buddha explaining the different meanings of all things. The herb spirit Banner of Light Outshing the Sun found the door of liberation able to be the advisor of all sentient beings, causing all who see to produce roots of goodness. The herb spirit Seeing in All Directions found the door of liberation of the mine of pure compassion able to make living beings give rise to faith and resolve by means of appropriate techniques. The herb spirit Everywhere Emanating Majestic Light found the door of liberation causing beings to remember the Buddha, thereby eliminating their sicknesses.

At that time the herb spirit Auspicious, imbued with power from the Buddha, looked over all the herb spirits and said,

*The Buddha‚Äôs knowledge is inconceivable‚Äì*
*He knows the minds of all sentient beings,*
*And by the power of various techniques*
*Destroys their delusions and infinite pains.*

*The Great Hero‚Äôs skills cannot be measured;*
*Nothing he does is ever in vain,*
*Unfailingly causing the suffering of beings to vanish:*
*Sandalwood Forest can understand this.*

*Observe the Buddha‚Äôs teachings like so:*
*He practiced for immeasurable eons*
*And has no attachment to anything:*
*This is the entry of Pure Light.*

*A Buddha is hard to meet, in a million ages;*
*If any can see one or hear one‚Äôs name,*
*It will unfailingly bring benefit:*
*This is the understanding of Universal Renown.*

*Each of the Buddha‚Äôs hair pores*
*Emits light annulling distress,*
*Causing worldly afflictions to end:*
*This is the entry of Radiant Pores.*

*All sentient beings are blinded by ignorance,*
*With an infinite variety of miseries from deluded acts‚Äì*
*Buddha clears it all away and opens the radiance of wisdom:*
*This Darkness Breaker can see.*

*One tone of the Buddha has no limiting measure‚Äì*
*It can open up the ocean of all teachings*
*So that all who hear can comprehend:*
*This is the liberation of Great Sound.*

*See how Buddha‚Äôs knowledge is inconceivable‚Äì*
*Appearing in all realms he saves beings there,*
*Able to make those who see follow his teaching:*
*This Outshining the Sun deeply understands.*

*Buddha‚Äôs ocean of compassionate means*
*Is produced to help the world,*
*Opening the right path wide to show beings:*
*This Seeing in All Directions can comprehend.*

*Buddha emits great light all around*
*Illumining all in the ten directions,*
*Causing virtue to grow as the Buddha‚Äôs remembered:*
*This is the liberation door of Majestic Light.*

------
If you read this far, I hope you found the excerpt enlightening. Now to conclude by dedicating merits:

May these profound merits and virtues
Be dedicated to all sentient beings
May we eliminate all karmic obstacles
And together may we attain the state of Buddhahood.

"How Buddhism comes to Earth, how it disappears, and what you can do about it","For a while before the Buddha awakened, the Earth was devoid of Buddhism (dhamma vinaya). Without the knowledge of dhamma, beings are bound to perpetual, stressful existence. 

But then a Buddha arose, around 520 BCE, and set the wheel in motion. By giving his teachings, people lend ear, implement them, awaken to them, and teach others. This is how dhamma spreads throughout the world. 

For the sheer fact that we are on a Buddhism sub-reddit, we can give thanks to the Buddha for giving that first teaching to his four friends. From that teaching, that wheel has still been spinning. The teachings have continued to spread in all directions, and the unprecedented power of the world wide web has facilitated the teachings and their spread even greater. 

But as soon as the Buddhas body dies, the teachings start to erode and the wheel begins to slow down. This is because the Buddha is no longer around to verify the dhamma, so it is up to us and our sangha to preserve it. The dhamma, the Buddha said shortly before his death, should be our teacher and guide when he is gone. 

Many things can help facilitate the erosion of the dhammas existence on Earth. Off the top of my head they are:

    -a schism in the sangha
    -allowing women into the sangha (dhamma disappears 2x as quickly)
    -listening to other teachers and not the Tathagata

From these actions, the dhamma is pushed a bit further into disappearance from this Earth. 


So what can we do to maintain the dhamma. First of all, realizing that dhamma comes and goes as a natural cycle is healthy and rooted in right view. But that doesnt mean we cant do our part to help it be preserved and even continue to grow. The webadmin at ATI is one person I can think of who has helped spread dhamma. We do it everyday here, too. As long as its real dhamma.

Because of the scope of audience online, the disappearance or spread of dhamma can be manifold. Hopefully we contribute to the continued spread of dhamma. :)

Before the recluse Gautama, there were numerous Buddhas (28 in our aeon) who awakened and there will be numerous Buddhas in the future who awaken to the truth on their own. 

But right now, 2014, we are still experiencing and learning from the teachings in what we hope to be their preserved form. And this is why putting the teachings into practice is so important. This is how the dhamma becomes a living thing within everything. 

Try and facilitate the spread of true dhamma, and not its disappearance. 

-----------
**The Buddha explains how Dhamma disappears from the Earth**

Staying at Savatthi. ""Monks, there once was a time when the Dasarahas had a large drum called 'Summoner.' Whenever Summoner was split, the Dasarahas inserted another peg in it, until the time came when Summoner's original wooden body had disappeared and only a conglomeration of pegs remained. 

""In the same way, in the course of the future there will be monks who won't listen when discourses that are words of the Tathagata ‚Äî deep, deep in their meaning, transcendent, connected with emptiness ‚Äî are being recited. They won't lend ear, won't set their hearts on knowing them, won't regard these teachings as worth grasping or mastering. But they will listen when discourses that are literary works ‚Äî the works of poets, elegant in sound, elegant in rhetoric, the work of outsiders, words of disciples ‚Äî are recited. They will lend ear and set their hearts on knowing them. They will regard these teachings as worth grasping & mastering.

""In this way the disappearance of the discourses that are words of the Tathagata ‚Äî deep, deep in their meaning, transcendent, connected with emptiness ‚Äî will come about.

""Thus you should train yourselves: 'We will listen when discourses that are words of the Tathagata ‚Äî deep, deep in their meaning, transcendent, connected with emptiness ‚Äî are being recited. We will lend ear, will set our hearts on knowing them, will regard these teachings as worth grasping & mastering.' That's how you should train yourselves.""

"How Aqua's song ""Barbie Girl"" relates to Buddhism (long)","Sometimes when I'm in the middle of some sort of process like driving or showering, I'll randomly start singing a piece of a song. I'll only sing a line or two, but inevitably, whatever I sang will prove itself to be a sort of signal for where my mind is at. It's like my subconscious wants to make a musical connection to whatever is going on. Today, I found myself singing a piece of the song ""Barbie Girl"" by Aqua. Which part?


""Imagination, life is your creation.""


It got me thinking about how the funny part of doing away with attachments and aversions, or living in the past or future, was that those things are all imaginary. It's like somewhere along the way I was told ""The imagination isn't for making friends unless you're a kid! If you're an adult, it's for reminding yourself of your past failings and future doom!"" hahaha. 


But the imagination is just the tool of the mind to create some something. Some concept, symbol, stuff like that. Essentially through my years of Buddhisting, I've learned the hardest lesson is simply making the mind a friend. At first, it felt like someone I didn't want to hang out with at all. Why would I? All it ever talked about was terrible things, and it looked down on everyone else for every reason it could muster unless they had something to offer me. What a jerk, right? That was my imagination. Now, I realize that imagination is just as much a part of me as anything else, and it deserves equal amounts of love and most importantly, space to grow. You can't just duct tape an annoying person's mouth, or run away from them or whathaveyou and expect that person to be any different the next time they make contact. You have to let them know that they are capable of infinitely different things, and that includes seeing the world in infinitely different ways. Sure, that friend might struggle, and the growing pains may feel hard to bare. But then, it's all imaginary anyways. 


I've learned that meditation can be a tool for me to run away, or a tool for me to explore and befriend. Either way, nothing is really happening. It's all in my imagination, but meditation helps me relax my imaginary concept of what kind of person I'm supposed to be, and with what mindset. The present moment is what I contrast that imagination with. The present is reality. My breath, my room, my bed, my a/c, my senses, my awareness of everything, that's the reality. 


If I take one more step back I can see that even that present moment is imaginary. It's all empty, and selfless. Nice work, 4 seals of Buddhism. And to contaminate that present with my imaginary b.s. attachment and aversions will never lead anywhere. That's like playing hide-and-go-seek with an imaginary friend and expecting to win in a real way of actually seeing them with my eyes, haha. 


So if my imagination creates all of this, and I can create whatever I want, what kind of world do I want to create?


Imagination. Life is your creation.

The White Privilege of Zen Buddhism?,"If there is no concrete self to be found and if we, before a single though occurs are all essentially perfect and the same. If we are to put down opinions of good and bad, like and dislike to just perceive a situation clearly, treat all beings as our self.... Where does the white privilege of the Buddha dwell and where is the white privileged of east asian Zen masters?

I tried to give the simple advice to a family member distraught by thinking about race and thinking about the thinking they were having to put it all down and just look at what is before in every situation. I tried to say that we are all one race despite and that we should just moment by moment respond compassionately with a clear mind and that if we all can do that that is how we end racism and war. But I was just told that such a view was itself racist and was a product of my white privilege. 

If this practice and philosophy is extends back 2500 years to India and also over a thousand years to east Asia how can I be founded on white privilege and how can one show someone that they are just perpetuating suffering by clinging to ideas?

I love this story so much - I'm trying to learn not to mind what others think of me - I welcome any help!,"At one time the Buddha was staying near RƒÅjagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels‚Äô feeding ground.

The brahmin BhƒÅradvƒÅja the Rude heard a rumor that a  brahmin of the BhƒÅradvƒÅja clan had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in the presence of the ascetic Gotama. Angry and displeased  he went to the Buddha and abused and insulted him with rude, harsh  words. When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him:

‚ÄúWhat do you think, brahmin? Do friends and colleagues, relatives and family members, and guests still come to visit you?‚Äù

‚ÄúSometimes they do, Master Gotama.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you then serve them with fresh and cooked foods and savories?‚Äù

‚ÄúSometimes I do.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut if they don‚Äôt accept it, brahmin, who does it belong to?‚Äù

‚ÄúIn that case it still belongs to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn the same way, brahmin, when you abuse, harass, and attack us who do not abuse, harass, and attack, we don‚Äôt accept it. It still belongs to you, brahmin, it still belongs to you!

Someone  who, when abused, harassed, and attacked, abuses, harasses, and attacks  in return is said to eat the food and have a reaction to it. But we neither eat your food nor do we have a reaction to it. It still belongs to you, brahmin, it still belongs to you!‚Äù# # #

I realized it is a slight variation to the gift story where it is food instead which I actually like a lot better because he talks about ""if you don't eat the food, do you react to it?""

I love that consuming aspect of it - because we are consuming or taking in others thoughts and options of it.  But if we don't consume it / eat it / take it in then how would we get a reaction?

request for advice regarding my practice,"Hello, my friends

I've Already decided on tibetan buddhism but it's tough for me to actually walk the path because of certain constraints I have. 

Due to the fact that I'm still a teenager, I don't really have the freedom to go to the tibetan-buddhist temples or centres in singapore. I also can't really spend any money on any malas, statues or online courses. Only thing I can really spend money on is books. I also don't really have the luxury of being able to study under a teacher right now.

Right now, how do I walk the path of tibetan-buddhism within these constraints? How do I learn meditation practices like tonglen, vipassana, shamantha and metta in a way that is true to my specific sect which is tibetan buddhism without spending any money on courses, online or in person? 

I do have full internet access but do bear in mind that even my access to tibetan buddhist books might be indirectly restricted due to my parents, who might not want me spending too much time on something like religion and/or who might be afraid that this distracts me from my studies.

Again, I need a structured practice but it's hard to do so with so little resources. Would appreciate any advice :)

Presenting the Dharma on Social Media,"Please read this post entirely before responding in order to avoid any misunderstanding. I will try to make my intentions as clear as possible.

I am considering the possibility of setting up a social media channel in order to present the Dharma to anyone who stumbles upon it and is interested.

By 'presenting the Dharma' I specifically mean:
* Quoting Pali Canon Suttas and Mahayana Sutras.
* Mentioning useful books and online resources.
* Sharing personal experience (explicitly marked as being personal).

EDIT: I forgot to mention that I intentionally chose the word 'presenting' as in 'showing', 'sharing', 'replicating'. I am *not* speaking of *teaching* the Dharma.

I *do not* intend to do any of the following:
* Misrepresent myself as a qualified teacher.
* Misrepresent my personal views as Dharma.
* Attack other traditions or religions.
* Making money in any shape or form.
* Using unskillful methods to boost engagement (e.g. baiting people with false promises or intentionally evoking intense emotions).
* Criticizing people or trying to pressure, change or convert them.
* Engage in fruitless online discussions.
* Pursuing fame or recognition.
* Starting a new school, let alone a cult.

I am also well aware of what awaits me if I slander the Dharma or cause division in a Sangha.

In short, I intend to present the Dharma in accordance with the Dharma.

Please also note that I am not expecting anything from this. I am not emotionally attached to this project. I just want to use my abilities and means to do what's skillful.

Thanks for reading all of this. Here are my questions:
* **Is this a skillful thing to do at all?** If not, please just say so.
* **If so, did I miss anything that I should be aware of?**",Buddhism,1705842173.0,t3_19c2ypf,0.75,2

Buddhisms view on Electronics and Mirrors,"So i think in the new age spiritual philosophy electronics are seen as problematic and to be treated with caution. I can see why, one can easily get lost in media and the comfort of machines that do everything, but with an old tradition like buddhism these things didnt exist back in the day. Is there a clear view on these things from a buddhist perspective, are they just another layer of maya ? nothing more then material illusions ?

Another question i have is that of how mirrors are seen. in the european thought the view in mirrors mostly seems to come from the mythos of narcissus who falls in love with his own redlection and drowns in the water in which he sees his reflection, we still call people narcistic who keep looking at their reflection. Is there from a buddhist view a reason to avoid looking at oneself in the mirror ? of course a mirror shows you a body that you inhabit, but i think there is another layer of self realisation in it, as some animals and young humans can recognize a body in a mirror, but not themselves.

Feeling doomed after the realization of our endless cycle.,"After many years spent thinking about Buddha's teachings, suddenly, the realizations start to actually ""sink"" into my own perception: I am going in circles with endless rebirths. 

I feel overwhelmingly intimidated by this recently and so suddenly - even though I know the concept of rebirth and karma long ago since I was a child. Even as time (which is a product of our own construction) goes on, I feel as if it is merely an illusion.  I am ... stuck. 

It feels like the road we are traveling on (with occasional stops to refuel - rebirth) is endless and  that going further is pointless as it never stops. It is like the mirror which is shattered... but we still need it to see ourselves.

Symbolism of ‚Äòwolves‚Äô and one‚Äôs energy ‚Äòfeeling as though it was from the earth‚Äô?,"
I went to a 7 day meditation retreat and my teachers repeatedly talked of the wolves they saw in me and which I may fee. Another symbol that was through in was that the way I shared felt very grounded and natural: ‚Äòearthy‚Äô is a word that came up a lot.

I have kind of ran through life with blinkers on having come from a ‚Äòtraumatic‚Äô history, but always forgetting about my past through distraction, giving into ‚Äòcravings‚Äô and busyness. Which has led to addiction and repeating sad ‚Äòtraumas‚Äô I have been in AA and another 12 step for a while.

I would be eternally grateful if anyone could shine a light on what‚Äôs meant by the wolves I‚Äôm feeding and what they see as my nature appearing ‚Äòearthy‚Äô. I have struggled trying to find information from researching alone.

Happy to share more about experience/ background and what led me there, but don‚Äôt want to overwhelm and aware that I have been unskillful in my arrival to Buddhism out of sheer curiousity and spooky coincidences rather than mindfully or in a well thought concentrated manner.

Connecting with Buddhists IRL when all centres nearby are controversial?,"Hi everyone, I just started getting into Buddhism and I'm very interested in developing my understanding of it! I have been going through the Tricycle beginner's course, meditating daily and starting to read more literature on the religion, its sects and practices. 

One thing I am struggling with is finding a sangha to connect with in person. I have been quite lonely for several months where I live, which is why I find it a bit important to find an IRL sangha.

I live in Newcastle upon Tyne, and I thought it would be easy to find a Buddhist temple/centre there, but they are all either Trinatra, NKT or Diamond Way.

Then Dustin the warrior chief went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:

‚ÄúSir, I have heard that the warriors of the past who were teachers of teachers said:
‚ÄòSuppose a warrior, while striving and struggling in battle, is killed and finished off by his foes. When his body breaks up, after death, he‚Äôs reborn in the company of the gods of the fallen.‚Äô
What does the Buddha say about this?‚Äù

‚ÄúEnough, chief, let it be. Don‚Äôt ask me that.‚Äù

For a second time ‚Ä¶

And for a third time the warrior chief said to the Buddha:

‚ÄúSir, I have heard that the warriors of the past who were teachers of teachers said:
‚ÄòSuppose a warrior, while striving and struggling in battle, is killed and finished off by his foes. When his body breaks up, after death, he‚Äôs reborn in the company of the gods of the fallen.‚Äô
What does the Buddha say about this?‚Äù

‚ÄúClearly, chief, I‚Äôm not getting through to you when I say:
‚ÄòEnough, chief, let it be. Don‚Äôt ask me that.‚Äô
Nevertheless, I will answer you.

When a warrior strives and struggles in battle, their mind is already low, degraded, and misdirected as they think:
‚ÄòMay these sentient beings be killed, slaughtered, slain, destroyed, or annihilated!‚Äô
His foes kill him and finish him off, and
when his body breaks up, after death, he‚Äôs reborn in the hell called ‚ÄòThe Fallen‚Äô.

But if you have such a view:
‚ÄòSuppose a warrior, while striving and struggling in battle, is killed and finished off by his foes. When his body breaks up, after death, he‚Äôs reborn in the company of the gods of the fallen.‚Äô This is your wrong view.
An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places, I say:
hell or the animal realm.‚Äù

When he said this, Dustin the warrior chief cried and burst out in tears.

‚ÄúThis is what I didn‚Äôt get through to you when I said:
‚ÄòEnough, chief, let it be. Don‚Äôt ask me that.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúSir, I‚Äôm not crying because of what the Buddha said.
But sir, for a long time I‚Äôve been cheated, tricked, and deceived by the warriors of the past who were teachers of teachers, who said:
‚ÄòSuppose a warrior, while striving and struggling in battle, is killed and finished off by his foes. When his body breaks up, after death, he‚Äôs reborn in the company of the gods of the fallen.‚Äô

Excellent, sir! Excellent!
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what‚Äôs there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways.
I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Sa·πÖgha.

How does your personal practice help others?,"Please read this post entirely before answering in order to avoid misunderstanding. I will try to be as clear as possible. Also, please don't read 'between the lines' because I don't think or write that way. Thank you!

In my limited experience, most Buddhist practices focus on liberating oneself. I have only recently begun my practice and have already noticed a significant, positive change, helping me to stay calm in previously stressful situations and allowing me to regain focus when I find myself trapped in unwholesome thoughts.

This change in my behavior also seems to slightly positively effect people in my surroundings. Since I am a beginner and have little knowledge and experience, this observation has led me to the following question:

How does *your personal* practice help other people?

Please note the following clarifications:

* I am explicitly asking about *your personal* practice, i.e. the way you as an individual choose to apply Buddhist teachings. Please respect everyone's personal accounts and focus on what's uniting instead of looking for aspects that divide.

* This is a question meant exactly as it is worded. It is *not* a judgemental statement or an attempt to manipulate, convince, criticize, blame, misrepresent, divide or anything else unwholesome.

* I am also not talking about wanting to change others, converting others to Buddhism or unsolicitedly pestering them. This question is aimed solely at your perspective and experience.

* This question is not about me! I'm happy with my practice and I strive to learn more and improve. I am *not* in distress, I am just curious and like to hear from others!

* Once again, this question is not meant to *imply* anything! I believe that one's practice mainly needs to focus on oneself and should not depend on others.

I am merely asking because I noticed this effect in my personal practice and was wondering if you experienced something similar (or maybe something completely different).

Thinking of converting from Nihilism to Buddhism,"Just like the title says. I think I want to become Buddhist, but I have no idea where to begin. At least I want to study what it entails more in-depth than what I learned in my high school world history class. Help would be greatly appreciated

My story: I was originally raised southern baptist Christian in the Bible Belt. There were good people in the 2-3 churches I attended throughout my childhood, but Christianity just always made me feel uncomfortable throughout life and many people were very judgmental // condescending. It always felt like some sort of cult. Especially with the influence it holds here in the United States.

Since I became an ‚Äúadult‚Äù and graduated high school and went off to college, I‚Äôve been kind of lost and wandering with my spirituality. I considered myself agnostic at this point. Going back to Christianity crossed my mind many times and I tried other churches, but it always just left a bad taste in my mouth. So then I heard about and tried self-guided Christianity. Couldn‚Äôt come to terms with that either. So eventually I came to this mindset that what if just absolutely nothing happened after death. Like poof just blackness. Nothingness. I eventually learned afterwards that was called nihilism and that there were two types: the ‚Äújust don‚Äôt try‚Äù kind and the ‚Äúmake the most of what you‚Äôve got‚Äù kind. Safe to say I stuck to the second one. This has worked the best for me, but it still feels like there‚Äôs gotta be something. Like I don‚Äôt believe that people don‚Äôt have spirits, and that directly contrasts with nihilism. I just don‚Äôt know what to believe about what happens with said spirits. This is where my idea of maybe the whole reincarnation thing with Buddhism might work as a faith for me.

"Question on Pureland, Amitabha, and Handheld Tibetan Prayer Wheels","So, I have questions. I wanted to question the validity of some statements too.

1. This video: https://youtu.be/vjW82VJXkQY?si=ZzwGyvcxGxjK1sUJ&t=543 it states that if you were to think up this Buddha (Amitabha) or simply call upon the name of this Buddha, even 10 times, they‚Äôll be able to attain rebirth in the pureland in their next life. Is that true? Does this have to be done daily or? Just recite his name 10 times once?

2. In the book The Wheel of Great Compassion by Larne Ladner and Lama Zopa Rinpoche, on page viii, it says, ‚ÄúThey gave me one, and I offered it to the king of Nepal. The Nepalese king asked me whether he should keep it. I said ‚ÄúYes, and if you have this prayer wheel next to you at the time of death, then your consciousness will be reborn in a pure land of Buddha.‚Äù‚Äù My question is: is that true? If you have a prayer wheel with you at the time of death, you‚Äôll be born in a pure land of Buddha? Which Buddha?

3. Will recitation of Amitabha‚Äôs name conflict with if you have a Tibetan Prayer Wheel with you at the time of death? Will it be possible to recite Amitabha‚Äôs name 10 times, have a prayer wheel with you at the time of death, and then be born into another Buddha‚Äôs pureland?",Buddhism,1705706330.0,t3_19awx8t,1.0,7
Review of From Here to Enlightenment: an Introduction to Tsongkhapa's Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment,"Review of From Here to Enlightenment: an Introduction to Tsongkhapa's Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment

Hello, here are my thoughts on this book. Don't get upset.

The reason I put that sort of obvious title is because that is something you should know about this book. It is the Dalai Lama explaining the aforementioned text. He says it is his main guide and he likes it very much. I like his explanations of it very much too. The Dalai Lama here writes very clearly and what you should do and what is necessary to attain enlightenment and details the steps and practices and philosophies. It is more directive than some of his other texts, by which I mean that in this text he tells you what to do, while in others he just examines what is good etc. One last thing you should know is that he has written several books examining Tsongkhapa's works. Tsongkhapa made the small, medium, and great treatises, and I think the Dalai Lama wrote books on each of those, maybe several books on each. My point there is that many of his books deal with the same subject, so you might want to pick the best one, instead of reading all.

Dealing with (justifiable) anger,"Hello,

How do you deal with ""justifiable"" anger?

I am, by nature, not an angry person. Since beginning to practice Dhamma and Buddhist teachings, I am even more self aware, and if I feel greed, anger or  ignorance present, I am usually quick to catch it early and meditate upon it.

A person entrusted with my childs care did something very malicious. I witnessed it. They are denying having done it, with it being my word against theirs.

I am angry, and I am having difficulty suppressing feelings of revenge and/or vindication. They could lose their job if I take it further. I have searched for compassion and understanding within myself, I have questioned my ego (as it pertains to revenge / vindication), but I am not still or calm inside. I feel that to ""let it go"" would be a betrayal of my parental duties.

I would appreciate hearing your thoughts, learnings and strategies as to how to find peace in this moment, and find compassion for this person.

**ÔºúËÅ≤Áå∂Âú®ËÄ≥Ôºå‰∫∫Â∑≤ÂæÄÁîüÔºû**

**For three generations my family are vegetarians. I have been a vegetarian since I was young. I learn the Buddha Dharma and I also uphold the Bodhisattva precepts. But my brother Hu Xue Hui does not have faith in the Buddha. He is a heavy smoker, a drunken person, with many bad habits. It is impossible to change him. I do not even dare to advise him to take refuge in the Triple Gem, what is more to ask him to uphold the precepts, to practise the Dharma. I was very worried for him.**

**In the year 2002, my brother was already seventy years old. Because of his bad habits, he was infected with the last stage of lung cancer. I thought maybe it was the right time to exhort him to recite Namo Amitabha Buddha. I dared not tell him about a change in his habitual way of life. Anyway, he did listen to me and recited Namo Amitabha Buddha at home sincerely. At times he would also visit the temple to pray to the Buddha.**

**In the year 2004, the 4th day of the 10th Lunar month, my brother phoned me up, asking me to go over. When I arrived, my brother looked fine. We recited Namo Amitabha Buddha together. I felt very strange because my brother was quite excited that day. We continued to sit on the bed to recite Namo Amitabha Buddha. At midnight, my brother said, ‚ÄòAmitabha Buddha is coming to bring me back.‚Äô**

**He sounded so relax. I simply could not believe in his words. This is because I know him thoroughly. He has so many bad habits. He did not even take refuge in the Buddha basically. He did not abide by the five precepts. He did recite Namo Amitabha Buddha but he did not even know about the transference of merits. So, will Amitabha Buddha come to welcome him in such a condition? I am not a good practitioner either. But I am still very much better than him. But I have not heard from Amitabha Buddha and I do not know when he will come to welcome me! So, when I heard that he was leaving with Amitabha Buddha, I could not believe it at all.**

**I was thus thinking but I still insisted to recite Namo Amitabha Buddha with him until early in the morning, that is the fifth day of the tenth Lunar month. My brother said, ‚ÄòYou see, Amitabha Buddha is here. I am leaving.‚Äô**

**Urgently I asked, ‚ÄòWhere is He?‚Äô¬† As I was sitting opposite to him while reciting Namo Amitabha Buddha, he pointed at my back and said, ‚ÄòHe is there‚Äô I quickly turned my head to take a close look but I did not see anything. I used my hand to pull at him and asked, ‚ÄòWhere is Amitabha Buddha? Where is Amitabha Buddha?‚Äô I asked him twice continually but I could not move him. There is no answer either. Suddenly I turned back and looked at him. I was really shocked. My brother was right. Amitabha Buddha had already come and brought him along.**

**The time taken from the instance I turned my head and looked back was only a few seconds. But my brother had already attained a rebirth, still sitting there. At that instant, I was so joyful yet my heart was very sad. My face was wet with tears.**

**My sister-in-law was upstairs and she heard our voice. She descended from the staircase and asked, ‚ÄòWhat are you two talking about? Your loud voice had woken me up.‚Äô I told her, ‚ÄòAmitabha Buddha has already brought my brother home‚Äô**

**She said tearfully, ‚ÄòBut wasn‚Äôt he still talking just now?‚Äô**

**‚ÄòYes, you are right. Amitabha Buddha is truly kind and compassionate. Please do not cry. Let us recite Namo Amitabha Buddha to send him to Pure Land.‚Äô**

**So, in this way, our whole family recited Namo Amitabha Buddha. After eight hours, we cleaned up his body and changed clothes for him. Brother‚Äôs body was very soft and he looked so nice. After three days, many people came to the funeral to have a look at him. They said that they had never seen such a handsome death man. Among the relatives, a few of them are touched by his death and they have started to recite Namo Amitabha Buddha.**

**Reflecting on this incidence, my brother should have known that he was going to attain a rebirth when he phoned me up. But he did not say anything. Maybe he knew that I would not believe in him. At mid-night, the fourth day, he said Amitabha Buddha was coming to bring him home. Maybe this is a signal for me. At that time, if I were to ask him, maybe he would tell me more. The problem is that I do not believe in him. That is why I did not bother to ask anything. Finally, when he said that the Buddha was there and it took only a few seconds for him to leave. I simply had no chance to ask any question. I am very regretful thinking about this. If I could believe in him earlier, and asked him what he had seen, asked for his opinions, it would be the best.**

**Anyway, my brother had left, in the most carefree way. He is the best example in the practice of Amitabha recitation to attain a rebirth. Truly speaking, he only knows the recitation of Namo Amitabha Buddha. Other than this recitation he knows nothing.**

**My brother‚Äôs attainment of rebirth has truly shaken me up. I have learnt a lot from him. In fact, I often look down on him as he can only recite Namo Amitabha Buddha. Unlike me, he did not uphold the precepts, did not take vegetarian diet, did not take refuge. He knows nothing about Sutras, mantras or cultivation. I was thus thinking, thousands of people can attain a rebirth, millions of people can attain a rebirth but I did not think he can attain a rebirth. But his attainment of a rebirth was because of his exclusive recitation of Amitabha Buddha. And he had left in such a wonderful way. All the time I was thinking I was much better than him. Only now I realize that he was very much better than me by so many times.**

**He had set a good example that the attainment of a rebirth does not rely on one‚Äôs personal effort. It relies totally on the strength of Amitabha Buddha‚Äôs Vows. When we recite Namo Amitabha Buddha, Amitabha Buddha will surely rescue every one of us to his World of Ultimate Bliss, in the Western direction, without leaving anyone out. As people have said, the strength of a good example is inexhaustible. The attainment of rebirth by my brother had truly release me from all my doubts and worries. My faith was greatly enhanced. From now onwards, I will learn from my brother and let go of my egoistic self -effort. I will recite Namo Amitabha Buddha exclusively until my last breath. Namo Amitabha Buddha!**

Skillful Reaction to Hateful Speech against others,"When it comes to Right Speech, how can one react skillfully when talking to someone who is making hateful or dehumanizing comments about others (e.g. minorities or marginalized people)?

You're visiting a relative and they unsolicitedly start making dehumanizing jokes about the slaughter of a local minority group.

Calmly pointing out that these specific jokes are not funny did not really work because the relative felt attacked and later even repeated the exact same jokes.

You have an acquaintance over for coffee and - again unsolicitedly - they say that people who rescue refugees from drowning are criminals that should be put in jail.

Asking them what they would do if they saw someone drowning, appealing to their compassion, was a dead end.

"Stupid question, but still would like to know","If someone who is a practicing Buddhist, is going through a lot in life, and is having a lot of mental problems, does the practice help relieve symptoms of the illness? This is of course assuming the individual is also receiving medial help, but for example, say a schizophrenic Buddhist is having hallucinations, does it help to be kind to the hallucinations. If a Buddhist with OCD is having intrusive thoughts, does it help to be kind towards everyone and everything, no matter the state of being the suffering individual is in? 

What I mean by does it help is, does it help relieve the symptoms of the illness, does right view, right intention, right speech, etc. Lessen the symptoms or at the very least the stress one is already experiencing. Or, is the effort put forth, despite the pain and suffering, just causing more stress than there already is because the effort is stressful while in a state of depression, anxiety, psychosis, what have you,  and would it then just be easier to give in to anger since that would flow more naturally then the stress created by resisting it with kindness to self and others?",Buddhism,1705674174.0,t3_19ak7v7,1.0,3

Boosting Vipassana,"Earlier in vipassana meditation, I used to struggle to know if I am craving/having aversion towards any pleasant/unpleasant sensation. 

Recently with other spiritual discourses, I learnt the following truth about life

""Our experience of life (either pleasant/unpleasant) is determined solely by us"". Not even the devine has a say in it. That's how the creator made us.

In brief, whatever my be the situation we may always choose to remain pleasant and work with whatever is in our hands. It doesn't matter what the result is because we are anyway pleasant. This let's us to be free of fear, suffering and leads us to do our best without any anxiety.

So I used this while doing vipassana and it seemed like earlier, we are unconsciously searching for ""how to be?"" during vipassana (other times too). Now that we have decided to be pleasant. So only remaining work is to observe the sensations.

Theravada and Mahayana,"Hey,

I‚Äôve read Mahayana buddhism first through Nagarjuna and then i‚Äôve read works on Zen (mainly Nishitani) and i‚Äôve read several sutras and a fair few works by Zen masters and poets. I‚Äôve also read the Dhammapada

One thing i‚Äôm confused about is this: Japanese Soto Zen buddhism seems to have a very this-world approach ‚Äî It disputes our conventional notions of this world and tries to collapse the distinction between this world and a supernatural ultimate reality, via dependent origination and interpenetration and interdependence etc. ‚Äî but it doesn‚Äôt seem overly focused on supernatural entities or other worlds/realms etc. 

What‚Äôs confused me is that it led me to think that Mahayana was more focused on a kind of experiential empiricism i always associated with the buddha, but upon further reading it seems like Theravada is more anti-metaphysical, more focused on experience as opposed to theories, less inclined to make metaphysical claims or posit other worlds and other beings, and that mahayana makes more claims

i‚Äôm asking because I like the idea of pursuing the way without needing lots of conditional metaphysical baggage ‚Äî i like the idea of non-attachment to views, a non-attachment that i saw as central to the buddha‚Äôs teachings. So the school that focuses more on experience as opposed to metaphysics will always be the school i‚Äôm drawn to. 

I thought i‚Äôd found this with Nagarjuna‚Äôs work, because it seemed like a kind of poetic anti-philosophy that imploded conventional categorisations and released me into a weird inbetweenness ‚Ä¶ zen koans had this effect on me too

But then mahayana sometimes seem to make a lot of metaphysical claims and posit a very particular being-centred ontology in terms of cosmic beings etc. ‚Äî you can see how confused i‚Äôm getting‚Ä¶. 

Are there similarities between Zen, Nagarjuna and Theravada that from some perspectives makes these three fit together? Or have i got it all mixed up‚Ä¶..",Buddhism,1705661807.0,t3_19agi6d,1.0,8

I do not know much about this thought I obviously need to do more research first this is kinda just a idea that popped up for me and I feel like it would be a good experience.

I have seen some people say that they wake up early in the morning do short runs and body weight exercises as well as train a form of martial arts. They do this as well as meditate multiple times a day. I have heard some places also have instructors to teach the language or other things.

How to escape the throes of Christian guilt and manipulation?,"I need help... this seed of ""I'm a sinner, I'm going to hell"" for wanting to practice Buddhism and release Christian guilt/harassment/manipulation has been stuck in my mind and heart for over 10 years now.

I want to believe God exists, but it just doesn't make sense... in my heart, I know it's just Hebrew mythology but I have this anxious voice in my mind.

Breaking the clinging to the 5 Aggregates - Different methods across cultures,"I've been looking at the world and the various people in the world for hints of enlightenment, and reading many holy books and literature, thinking about ways different religions and groups might cease clinging to the 5 aggregates through their practices and beliefs.  


The Buddha identified the 5 clinging aggregates as a short summation of what leads us to suffering when discussing the 4 noble truths.  


""In brief, the 5 aggregates subject to clinging are suffering""

&#x200B;

The 5 Aggregates are:

1. Form (Body)

2. Feeling (Like/Dislike/Neutral)

3. Perception

4. Formations (Volitional Constructs, i.e. Will)

5. Consciousness (Dual Knowledge?)

&#x200B;

In examining Christianity, I noticed there's an egoic protection gifted to people through God. A good Christian is supposed to turn their will over to God. The buddha said that to cease clinging to one aggregate is to cease clinging to all aggregates. So I realized that perhaps Christianity is a method of achieving enlightenment, by letting go of the 4th aggregate.  


In Zen Buddhism, they will give Koans to buddhist disciples, and I believe that when done properly, the contemplation of a koan will lead to the breaking of the aggregate of perception (though it could be formations or consciousness - I'm not sure, despite studying these 5 words for hundreds of hours).  


The buddha gave us 4 mindfulness meditations that I think are designed to facilitate breaking the clinging to the aggregates as well. To meditate on the body (form). To meditate on our feelings. To meditate on our mental state (perception). And to orient our will around achieving enlightenment, meditating on select teachings of the buddha.  


Has anyone ever thought about this and found other examples in other cultures?

Buddha statue,Around 6 years ago I got a call from an acquaintance of mine. His girlfriend was a diagnosable kleptomaniac. She would go out at night and steal whatever she could find and bring it home and hide it around his house. So he had called me saying his girlfriend had stolen a Buddha statue! And that i needs to come get it ASAP! He said he didn't want any trouble lol so I went over there and grabbed it. I wonder how wrong it is to have done that. I mean stealing from someone who stole something is still stealing right? What if it had been the case that I loved cycling and she stole a bike? Does it matter that it was a Buddha that it was stolen and it was being disrespected probably would have got broken or ended up somewhere weird? I know that's justifying.

Difficulties finding a Sangha,"The closet one to my house is called True Buddha sangha, and it follows some dude who claims to be the next buddha and was the lotus boy in another life or something?!  It sounded very sus and upon researching appears to be a cult. It's very hard to find a good sangha even though there are many in my area. I have reached out to a number of Vietnamese and Thai based sanghas/temples, but with no response, I assume they are not open to westerners nor have any english speaking monks/services. The ones that do have english that are near me are Theravada, Won Buddhism, White Plum Zen, and Plum Village. I wanted to take my teen with me to the smaller Plum Village sangha I had been attending for the last year, but its very small and just for adults at this time. The Theravada sangha was very welcoming of having myself and teen attend, but their weekly in person sangha is sunday 5-7pm in the middle of family dinner time, so sadly that ruled itself out. The Won Buddhist sangha was open to my teen coming with me, but I've read a lot of criticism that its not really Buddhism and I've read how its a blend of several things that were local to Korea when it came about. Has anyone been to a Won Buddhist sangha?? The Zen sangha is all older folks from what I could see and is the farthest away.  The Theravada sangha has a few monks from Sri Lanka, which is cool. The Won is run by a Korean priest, and the others run by older westerners. Currently I am doing virtual Dhamma talks with the monks from the Theravada sangha, and visiting the plum village sangha in person. Not ideal, but its the best I have available.

Getting therapy about childhood abuse vs. bad karma of speaking terribly about people,"I am really confused.

I have recently (last few years) realized what I thought was a good upbringing was actually abusive.

I have been to therapy and have been exploring different books describing C-PTSD, etc.

Some of them recommend ""angering"" verbally at the parent (not around them).

I have taken to this behavior and found it to be very helpful.

However.

I am saying many, many mean things about my mom.

Sometimes I am writing them down and posting them on reddit.

I worry that while this is helpful to me, it might be causing negative energy.

1. I fear that someone will read my angry words and it will increase their own hate
2. I fear that saying bad things about people is bad

But.

The other option is to keep it inside.  I am almost entire sure this is wrong.  Holding harmful experiences inside is damaging.

I have explored other ideas like *it's my karma to have these bad feelings* but that seems like more victim mentality from my C-PTSD.

I am pretty sure I deserve happiness just like anyone else.  I am pretty sure that no one *deserves* bad things (karma arguments?) and that suffering and not being permitted to free that anger is wrong.

Then again, that sounds a lot like my childhood (suffering and *not being permitted* to do anything about it.

**Questions:**

To what extent am I generating bad karma by yelling/screaming/searing at my mom (in private) to let out the anger?

To what extent am I generating bad karma by posting it online (it's anonymous, I'm not naming her)?  My goal for this is twofold:  First, to get validation that what I experienced was bad.  Second, so other people don't feel alone if they're experiencing the same.

To what extent am I generating bad karma by posting recordings of my rants online (anonymous, of course, I'm not naming her)?  My goals for this are the same as above.

I can speak from experience that *reading about* other people's experiences has been validating to me.  It has made me a more peaceful person, not toward my mom, but toward society in general.  *Other people experienced it to... it is wrong*.

Rather than keeping it all inside and wondering exactly I did wrong to deserve such bullshit.

I'm interested in answers to the questions above, and not about ""soul contracts"" or other such rationalizing the abuse type answers.

Furthermore, I am not interested in platitudes like ""bad thoughts cause people's bad words, bad words lead to bad actions, etc.""  I highly doubt anyone will read what I write and attack somebody.  I more likely believe that someone will read what I write and *feel validated and heard*, creating peace in their life.

The more I think about it, the more Buddhism seems like I am just supposed to *suffer and take it.*

I am also not interested in forgiving.  Do not confuse, I am not talking about carrying a grudge.  But *forgiving* implies ""oh, you abused me, but that's ok, we can still interact *because it's family""* or other such nonsense.

I have been tolerant my entire life.  It has caused undue burden and strain and distress.  I was never allowed to, nor did I even know it was possible, to have a voice  I did not know I didn't have to just *endure the abuse*.  My goal moving forward, to heal myself, is to not do that anymore.

Furthermore, I have spent most of my life parentified by my mom (""parentified"" is a term meaning when the child is responsible for the emotional regulation of the parent, which is the converse of what it's supposed to be.  Parents are supposed to help children develop mentally well.  But my childhood was spent controlling my mom's moods to make sure she was happy, therefore I can be safe).  I constantly put other people before myself because I am SO AFRAID of people being in bad moods, because my entire childhood was spent being afraid of my mom if she wasn't in a good mood.

I finally realized a lot of this stuff is wrong.  I do not know how to express it without concern of creating bad karma.

I assume I made myself clear.",Buddhism,1705610356.0,t3_19a06ae,0.74,7
Death vs Nirvana for Secular Buddhists,"Note: I'm not fully convinced or unconvinced of this narrative, but I'd like to hear other perspectives because the logical conclusion of this seems quite fatal. 

Materialism seems to be the worldview we are converging upon with more advances in neuroscience and other areas. A subjective mental life apart from physical processes in the brain seems to be harder and harder to justify. Preliminary studies are showing our ability to extract ideas and music from electrical impulses, which seems crazy to think. 

Buddhist philosophy seems compatible with materialism regarding non-self and dependent origination. The concept of the ""self"" as a product of a series of impersonal processes seems to be the case in both worldviews. Buddhism just seems to take an experiential viewpoint of the nature of reality as opposed to the third-person intellectual view of science. 

The problem is that under materialism, the self and suffering are extinguished with the destruction of the body. After all, without a mental life independent of physical processes, what could reincarnate? 

If somebody is secular, what reason is there for the Eightfold Path if death is an easier solution? One reason I see is that living allows one to reduce suffering for other living beings. Another argument is that nirvana would be a mistake in neither world view while death would be an error if there is reincarnation, so the Eightfold Path is valuable in all cases.

But both of these arguments are indirect reasons for living. Normally, ontological questions are understandably quite futile in Buddhism, but this seems important because it directly corresponds to the correct way to reduce suffering.

Reflection on Samsara and the Wheel of Life,"So I was watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WPjlUkTuDU) on Samsara and the illustration of the Wheel of Life and I had a thought that I wanted to share in case anyone else has any reflections etc. 

During the video, the speaker mentions in passing that the realms could be beyond our world **or** they could be representations of our existence. 

I think that it makes perfect sense that the realms can be representations of our existing lives.

I mean just consider the hub (the three poisons) and the outer layer of the hub (Karma). When we live by the three poisons, our actions will be coloured by them, meaning the reactions to our actions are mirrored and we end up in either of these realms. If we are addicted we will constantly find ourselves (mostly) in the realm of hungry ghosts (interesting side note: Gabor Mate, a famous psychologist, published a book titled ""In The Realm of Hungry Ghosts"" which is about addiction), always wanting more than we can consume and can never fill ourselves. If our life goes by perfectly we end up in the God Realm, having everything we could possibly want but still not reaching enlightenment. 

This would also mean that not only is the Eightfold Path the Middle Path, but existence itself is best in the middle, since the human realm is on the middle level (or close enough) of Samsara and the human realm is where we can reach enlightenment.

Now I'll admit, this reflection is flawed since it doesn't point to the obvious point of the Wheel of Life: Birth and rebirth, since we are reborn into these realms and eventually out of this wheel. This reflection only considers the wheel's application on existence.

I would love to hear what anyone else thinks.

What to do if I want to start practicing Buddhist teachings but struggle to believe in some parts of them?,"I've recently started reading about Buddhism and it's teachings appeal to me a lot, including the ""unnatural"" (sorry i dont know what to call them) parts, such as rebirth, karma. 

And while I would like to believe that they were true, I struggle to find any reason to. I mean, it's not proven to be true and I wonder what logical reasons do I have to believe this over any other beliefs?

Because even though those beliefs appeal to me the most out of all religions that I've read about, especially the concept of karma, the fact that I like them doesn't convince me to be a reason to actually think they exist. Just because I like something does not mean it 100% is true right?

I hope my post doesn't come across as rude, I don't mean to say that the beliefs are anyhow ""wrong"" or neccessarily aren't true, but that I personally struggle to find a reason to make myself believe.

The Three Requests are Answered,"## [The Three Requests are¬†Answered](https://oridharma.wordpress.com/2018/08/12/your-mean-that-butterfly-is-our-mother/)

üì∑

Three days after the funeral, the eldest son was sleeping upstairs. His two brothers were reciting the Buddha Name for their mother. Suddenly they saw a butterfly flew into the house. One of them took a fan and started to hit at it. Their niece saw this and quickly she ran upstairs to wake up her father, the eldest son in the family, ‚ÄòPapa, papa, please be quick. Uncles are hitting the butterfly. It could be grandmother.‚Äô

He quickly went down to stop his brothers from hitting the butterfly.

The 2nd son asked, ‚ÄòVery strange! Brother, didn‚Äôt you say our mother is born in the pure land. Now you say the butterfly is mother. That is the animal realm!‚Äô

The third son also nodded in agreement.‚Äò

It is winter time and not many butterflies can be found. Let us conduct an experiment.‚Äô

The eldest son said, ‚ÄòButterfly, if you are mother‚Äôs transformation, please fly and land on my hand.‚Äô

Sure enough, the little butterfly flew towards him and rested on his palm.  
‚ÄòMother, are you really born in the pure land? Do show us. ‚Äô The eldest son said again. The little insect flew up towards the lighted lotus flower lantern on the Buddha altar and landed in the middle of the lotus. The three sons were confirmed that it was their mother.

The third son said, ‚ÄòMother, when you are alive, you asked me to bring you upstairs to see the place. I did not do it because I was afraid that you might fall and get wounded. Now, can you land on my head and I will bring you upstairs?‚Äô

The butterfly flew and landed on the tip of his head. He walked carefully up the shaking wooden stairs, walked one round on the moving planks on the first floor and came down slowly. After touching the ground floor, the butterfly flew away.

This was the story told by the eldest son in the family at Zhong Pu.

Mr. Huang invited him to give a talk to an audience on the three responses he received when his mother passed away.

His mother was down with the cancer of nose and throat. Her whole face was in a mess of rotten flesh and pus and she smelled more like a rotten corpse. Luckily she had three good sons who did not leave her when she was so sick, that she could not even lie on her bed to take a sleep. She could only rest on the table to take a nap when she was too tired.

The eldest son was working in the Buddhist articles circulation centre. In the family, he and his wife were Buddhists as the two young brothers did not have faith in the Dharma. So when the mother was so sick, the eldest son pleaded her to recite the Buddha‚Äôs Name. In such sufferings she believed and started to recite Amitabha Buddha. Her sickness deteriorated but there was no pain. The eldest son pleaded her to become a vegetarian but she stubbornly refused.

His good friend from Jia Yi County, Mr Huang also came to counsel her. She would recite Amitabha silently as she was unable to talk. After talking to her he found that the old lady had seen Amitabha Buddha three times. When she was asked why she did not go, she just shook her head. She was not ready!

Mr Huang was the disciple of Master Jian Yin. So he invited his Shifu to give her the counselling. He drove the Venerable to the deep mountain, to a village called Mei Shan under the Jade Mountain. After many meandering, the Venerable felt quite uncomfortable and said, ‚ÄòGoodness, the road is so terrible. It is good enough if you come here alone to counsel her. Why are you asking me?‚Äô

The disciple answered, ‚ÄòShifu, the Buddha came three times and yet she still refused to leave. That is why I have to carry you personally to see her.‚Äô

After listening to this, Venerable Jian Yin was greatly ashamed of himself. He said, ‚ÄòAmitabha Buddha came three times without any complain and here I am coming for the first time and already complaining about the terrible states of the road. What a shame!‚Äô So he gave rise to a mind of great repentance, thinking of his lacking in compassion when compared to the Buddha.

When they arrived at the small house which was built during the Japanese time, the Venerable saw the address was Shui Dao Tou. He entered the room and immediately smelled the stench of the sick woman. It was like the stink of a corpse, but no, she was still alive, only that the face was less than the face of a human as it was covered with blood and pus, with pieces of flesh here and there.

The Venerable asked, ‚ÄòOld Bodhisattva, I heard that you have seen Amitabha Buddha three times, right?‚Äô She could hear but she could not answer, only nodded her head.

‚ÄòSo, why did not you go with Him?‚Äô the Venerable continued to ask.  
She remained silent.  
‚ÄòAre you a vegetarian?‚Äô She shook her head.

Venerable studied her. If he did not give her some good scolding, surely she would not change. So he hardened his voice,  
‚ÄòIf I were to let you see yourself in the mirror, I think you will faint.‚Äô He continued, ‚ÄòAnd you shut yourself in this room, you do not even smell the stink of the room. Those who enter will surely be intolerable to this stench and yet you think you are still very fine. You are too stuck up.‚Äô

She kept quiet.

‚ÄòJust look at yourself, Amitabha came three times as He does not despise your smell, your age and the terrible conditions. You think you are so great? Refusing the invitation of such an Honourable Buddha?‚Äô

He raised his voice in anger, ‚ÄòNext time, when He comes again, will you go?‚ÄôShe looked up at the Master and slowly nodded her head.

‚ÄòYou are so fortunate to have three filial sons who take good care of you. They do not leave you when you are in this terrible condition. They only want to help you especially your eldest son who have asked you to change your diet. Tomorrow onwards will you take only vegetables?‚Äô he asked.

She nodded again.

And after that the Master left. He predicted the old lady would leave within a week. She passed away on the third day.

The eldest son requested three wishes from the Buddha, which he himself felt that he had been asking too much also. Yet the Buddha granted his wishes.

He said to the Buddha, ‚ÄòMy family is situated in this deep mountain. Most of the people here do not have faith in the Buddha. And I am the only one who has faith in the Buddha. Even my brothers do not believe. Please let my mother be free from the terrible stench. If she is so smelly, I think no one in the village will come to the funeral.

Secondly, let her body be kept in a stable condition and does not deteriorate.

Thirdly, I pleaded the Buddha to show me a real response that my mother is born in the Pure Land.‚Äô

During the funeral, he was surprised that the smell was gone. He took a good look at his mother‚Äôs face and found that it was as though wrapped with a thin layer of preservative film. He really felt the kindness of the Buddha. The impossible requests were answered. And the two brothers who were forced to recite the Buddha Name now truly felt the responses and their faith increased after seeing the inconceivable butterfly, the transformation body of their beloved mother.",Buddhism,1705593152.0,t3_199t8ai,1.0,3

This kinda look interesting and realistic to me btw. I think morality is important but secondary from my personal view compared to Power.

Karma is created by thoughts and Intention and feelings. So long lasting negative feelings will create bad karma.

I read somewhere that Victims get More karma than Oppressor. How accurate is that?

Btw, does non-trivial and serious offences count to Karma for stronger people?

What does karma look / act like?,"For example; let‚Äôs say there is a person who abused and SAd an old close friend; and eventually giving them heroin to try, which quickly killed them. 

If you run into that person years down the line and take their life- as they‚Äôre still a drug dealing sexually abusive stain- so, is going to prison the ‚Äúkarma‚Äù? Possible feelings of ‚Äúguilt‚Äù (which there probably wouldn‚Äôt even be)? 

Or is it literally like ‚Äúooggy-booogy‚Äù Christian Hell?

Question about the BƒÅhiya Sutta relating towards a recent personal discovery,"I've recently discovered that when I stop focusing my eyes on specific things and get into a sort of panoramic view that suddenly noises that triggered strong emotional reactions like loud door banging don't trigger anything. I hear the sound but there is no emotional response like fear or anger. I just hear the sound. It's like a binary on/off switch. I don't know what's happening and the only thing that comes to my mind is this quote:

>Then, BƒÅhiya, you should train yourself thus: In reference to the seen,  there will be only the seen. In reference to the heard, only the heard.  In reference to the sensed, only the sensed. In reference to the  cognized, only the cognized. That is how you should train yourself. When  for you there will be only the seen in reference to the seen, only the  heard in reference to the heard, only the sensed in reference to the  sensed, only the cognized in reference to the cognized, then, BƒÅhiya,  there is no you in connection with that. When there is no you in  connection with that, there is no you there. When there is no you there,  you are neither here nor yonder nor between the two. This, just this,  is the end of stress.

I'm not sure if this is what was meant by that passage? Does anyone know what exactly is happening?",Buddhism,1705575007.0,t3_199ng7a,0.76,4

"Does it make sense to talk about ""breaking the cycle of Samsara""?","On first glance, this seems like a sensible formulation; ""breaking the cycle"" is a familiar formulation to anglophones, and we want to prevent the cycle from cycling, so ""breaking"" it seems to be the applicable word here.

But I'm not sure if there are philosophical/symbolic implications here that I'm not considering. The dharmic wheel is a frequent motif in Buddhist (and Hindu and Jain) art, and used as a symbol of Buddhism, and it is never shown broken, but rather as if it was something worth of respect and reverence in its complete and unbroken wholeness, even if individuals want to get off it.

Gravity really is the best analogy to Kamma/Karma!,"I made a post on this sub a while ago questioning the subscribers on why there is such a thing as The Five Great Sins/Evils, which are said to lead one straight to Naraka (hell). I was quite satisfied with the insightful answers I got and I felt I understood the matter. Then on yesterday, I woke up in the middle of a stormy night with a thought: if we compare the laws of Kamma to the laws of Gravity, the principles that govern both are extremely similar. I KNOW this isn't a new idea. Many before me have compared these two universal laws. But I'll share a few of my thoughts I haven't seen articulated in this manner elsewhere. 

‚óè On the matter of the Five Great Sins, committing matricide, patricide, killing a monk, killing a Buddha or splitting up a Sangha are kind like jumping off a tall building: even if regret what you've done afterwads, YOU MUST STILL TAKE THE FALL. This is why, regardless of whether or not you come to repent later on, YOU WILL BE REBORN IN NARAKA for committing those crimes. Kamma is both intention AND action, so a change of heart can only prevent one from committing/experiencing negative Kamma in the future, but DOESN'T NEGATE the energy of past actions: they will manifest until that energy ends.

‚óè Kamma is an inescapable, impartial, indifferent, non-judgemental force, which is very in line with the concept of gravity. 

‚óè Kamma isn't inherently good or bad--those are distinctions we make up to describe results that lead to happiness or suffering. Much in the same way, gravity is not inherently good or bad. For instance, teering on a fence will likely make you fall and hurt yourself--it's an unskillful action leading to an unpleasant result. But using gravity to make a siphon or set up a satellite can solve many problems--skillful actions that results in happiness. 

‚óè A drop of bad Kamma in a lake of good Kamma is not nullified, but gets ""diluted"" so that it is not as bad--in this case, bad Kamma is still like gravity making you fall, and the good Kamma is like having a parachute or a very soft surface underneath: it will minimise the impact. 

‚óè Learning the Dharma, is like learning parkour: you learn to better control your balance and jump over obstacles, but also how to land gracefully in case you do fall. 

‚óè The Kamma of our minds is like gravity pushing a river: technically, the water isn't bound by the riverbed and can escape, but the trend is that it will follow the river's course--this is why it's difficult to destroy our vices and bad habits--it's like swimming against the current, against gravity :)

"DN 30: A sutta explaining 32 good deeds you can do, plus rewards.","https://suttafriends.org/sutta/dn30/
https://suttacentral.net/dn30/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin

Thus sutta contains information about the rewards of being truthful, helpful, compassionate, and so on by body speech and mind. If you want a good list of various wholesome qualities to develop in the practice, try this sutta out.
-
Rebirth wise, what I find particularly interesting about this sutta is that it seems to suggest that a heavenly birth through good deeds is beneficial even after you come back from heaven. You get another shot at human life/dhamma practice by doing this and get a physical body part corresponding with the achievement.

I'd admit, though, that it's rare to see some of these parts on people, like 40 teeth or long hands. Nevertheless, I would hazard to say that aiming for a good heavenly birth and nothing more doesn't mean you doom yourself to some complete random samsara rebirth lottery, but that the accumulation of merit predisposes you to a better human birth.

Ajahn Punnadhammo (great teacher btw) said in a livestream that there usually aren't extreme ""samsara rebirth"" swings, ie if you did good now you're most likely to get a good rebirth, and if you have a good birth now it was probably because of a good birth before.

"‚ÄúThe harder we struggle to establish ourselves and our relationships, the more painful our experience becomes‚Äù.","This excerpt from buddhanet.net is intriguing. It got me thinking‚Ä¶ we are constantly defining ourselves based on who we want to be and who we think we are. We assign narratives to ourselves based on our likes and dislikes. 

Same for others, we spend so much of our waking time thinking about others. What they wore, what they said, how they said it, and on and on. We think about what others think about us. 

Many people want the best things, they want the best houses, a perfect family, and a clean image. When those ideals are not achieved, it leads to discontentment. 

I think about my own relationships and expectations of others and see a lot of the reasons for my own struggles in life. I see these same struggles normalized in the people I‚Äôm around, like a sickness that you get used to feeling. 

When I think about suffering as an illness, it really starts to make sense to me and gives me compassion - There is a cure, but most people just get used to feeling ill and have forgotten there are medicines that can treat the illness.",Buddhism,1705544649.0,t3_199f1uz,1.0,5

The only chance I've got is religious studies lessons on Mondays and Tuesdays when the particular trigger (my friend) sits next to me, and the teacher is understanding enough to let me take a moment outside. But at lunchtime, I cannot escape the noise, especially from her. I can already hear a million noises from the projector, the clock, others making general noises etc, they make it hard to focus, but I can deal with them.

I want to have metta and be a calm and kind person, but I don't know what to do to be like this, because I can try hard, but I'll lose it.

I'm not sure what should be the right path to be more compassionate to myself,"I hope I won't turn this into a very long post, so I'll try to give some context first where I'm coming from. I have mild generalized and social anxiety which over the years of self-reflection, therapies and a ton of help from buddhist teachings I've come to understand better and I'm at a point where I feel I'm beginning to accept it in a more compassionate way. I'm not expecting to get rid of it overnight or even at all, as I used to before, and I don't hate myself anymore for having this condition.

However, it definitely still affects me, and especially at work it causes me a lot of stress. I'm very aware that this stress is founded on false and unnecessary beliefs, but it is also a fact that this knowledge by itself won't make it go away, and it makes me sad to see how it affects my physical and mental health. So even though I can cope with it better, I still keep wondering if it wouldn't be better for me to change my career expectations and find more suitable jobs for me with less prestige perhaps but something that would allow me be more at peace with myself and my relationships to others.

But here's where my dilemma comes in, because I also wonder if it's perhaps just my anxiety trying to make me avoid challenges and difficult things that might be actually be good for me. This wouldn't be anything new, of course, and I feel a big part of my life has been a constant push-back against what my anxiety tells me to do and what I think it's worth doing. On the other hand, I have also changed my mind or rather realized what I truly think it's worth doing and having. I'm an engineer by training and for most of my career I didn't even see any other choice rather than keep climbing the ladder to work in big companies and reach the highest positions. But perhaps too late I had to be honest to myself and realize that I don't like those positions. I think I always knew but somehow I didn't even consider it an option not to do that because anything else would be failure.

 I already did quite a change, and I'm now working in the healthcare field towards a doctorate, so I'm pretty far from profit driven motivations, but I'm perhaps even deeper in a place with high prestige, high-stake projects and full of extremely smart and competitive people. So in a way it's very encouraging, positive challenges and it's great to be able to contribute and have nice impact from my job, but it brings me suffering through the stress and anxiety. I keep going back and forth if it's just my fears making me doubt if all these positive things are actually worth it, or if it wouldn't be the better choice for myself to let go of the need to be involved with this ""big"", ""important"" jobs. I think I genuinely believe it's not worth it, but again, what if this is just a trap from my mind to keep me in a comfort zone? and what if I end up with the same stress and anxiety in any other type of job? 

I'm pretty lost how to approach this, how to know which of the inner voices are the most genuine ones, because I can see how many of the things I thought I wanted are just what society told me to want but not what I really care about. I hope I managed to express myself clearly. Any light on dealing with this would be very appreciated!",Buddhism,1705512715.0,t3_1992bje,0.76,4

A new understanding of Dhukka made me re-evaluate my life,"I used to meditate twice a day religiously.  I felt much more at peace in the world and with the way things were.  Several kids and jobs later...I perceive life as more stressful.  I consider myself successful.  I have everything a person could ever want.  A great family, job, home, friends, money, health, etc., but something always seems off.  The simplest way I can put it is that it (it being life itself) is never quite good enough.  In my mind, I cannot be content with it.  I want to 'make it better' in a variety of ways or seek to improve on every aspect of my life no matter how good it already is which removes the enjoyment of it.

This is where dhukka comes in for me.  I always associated dhukka with the classic ""life is suffering"" which read on the service just sounds like life is one series of subsequent miserable events.  I delved a little deeper into the word and found a definition more like 'something is always slightly off' or a 'pebble in your shoe' or a 'squeaky wheel.'  I appreciate these definitions more because that is what I feel in my own life.  I crave improvement everywhere which I *think* leads to this sense of something is always off.  

I am a driven and motivated person, but I have not paid much attention to my mental health over the past several years.  I want to change that, but I don't know how to reconcile this concept of dhukka with still being a driven and motivated person.  Buddhism talks a lot about alleviating our desires or removing cravings, but how can we do that without giving up on goals, dreams, pursuits of improvement etc.?  Is it possible to remove craving from our lives, enjoy what is, but still have goals and aspirations?

A multiplicity of past lives?,"Hi all, wanted to check your intuition on past lives.

I resonate with the idea of anatman, and that we are absent of inherent, intrinsic nature, and that we are are an ever changing momentary confluence of conditions and relationships. I resonate with karma as volitional action, and cause and effect. 

Where I am a bit less clear is the idea of mindstreams. (Also, do people have good sutta references for this?) As I picture things, if I go ‚Äúupstream‚Äù into past lives, it seems very natural to picture a ‚Äúforking‚Äù into many streams, ie a multiplicity of multiple past lives at any point in time. Similarly, as I go down stream I also don‚Äôt see why a mind stream necessarily needs to stay singular, and not fork into multiple streams later on, just as causes can lead to multiple effects, all intermingling... And I suppose parinirvana is the mindstream dissipating altogether?

To clarify, I‚Äôm not against past lives or rebirth. Rather, it‚Äôs not obvious to me why or why not past lives and future lives should be singular, the way I usually hear people talk about it (and also becomes much easier to confuse with reincarnation, which we all know rebirth is not). Both seem plausible to me. Am I missing something obvious?

"Buddhism claims to have exclusive truth in terms of the ""right"" path to God. What makes Buddhism's truth claims any different or better than other religions that make similar claims?","First, I come as a seeker, not as someone who is trying to tear down. Having spent 30 years of my life in a high-demand religion that claimed to be ""the only true church"" I am extremely wary of exclusive truth claims.

In my short study of Buddhism, I find the claims and argumentation in support of Buddhism being the only true path to ""god"" using the same basic structure as any other religion, namely that truth is experiential, etc. and so if you as if it is improving your life and bringing you close to god, it must be true. I find this type of argumentation lacking, though, as truth in this sense seems to be subjective and yet I also don't know that even when I study science I find objective truth.

That leads me to the conclusion that Buddhism is no better but also no worse than any other religious system in terms of arriving at truth. I'm sure there are those here who would disagree, so I would love to hear different perspectives on my observations.

How to deal with a toxic friend (wisdom and advice request),"Hi friends

I have someone who I would perhaps consider my best friend but he's really toxic to me lately.

There are points in time where he treats me nice but he also treats me badly for some reason which I am not so sure of.

I've bonded a lot with him and confided in him a lot but recently, we've gone through a period of on-and-off relationship. He get's mad at me for little reason and he said something about not liking gay people or something like that when I asked him about the toxicity yesterday. We made up the very same day and now, I'm back to him being mean to me. Yesterday, he told me over text to fuck off and to go kill myself.

It's tough because I am not saying I'm perfect- but to my knowledge, I didn't do anything wrong to the point of deserving this treatment.

I've already communicated extensively how the things he's doing cross my boundaries/line, verbalising my feelings to him. But he doesn't seem to care much or at all.

But the thing is, I'm kinda lonely in school. Yes, I have many ""friends"", or maybe just ""aquaintances"", but he's the only guy I'm actually really close to. He's always been the more dominant one in our friendship but that just doesn't give him the right to treat me like this. I texted him today, apologising for putting so much blame on him (even though I don't remember doing that) and asked if we could promise to be nice to each other in the future. I asked him to explain to me why he is or was mad at me, saying that if he doesn't tell me, I can't change anything. And he ignores all the three messages.

I know that some folks would say in the comments that this is a result of attatchment or something like that but aren't humans social creatures? for a period of time and though this is lesser the case anymore, he was willing to befriend the kid that no one wanted to befriend.

I need a way to alleviate my suffering. How to proceed? If we make up again, do I go back to him? Do I try to be friends with him again?

Assuming we don't make up, how do I alleviate my suffering?

The past few days feels so long.

I just want love and friends and peace and happiness and truth be told, I'm not okay with being detatched from sociality, from being ""okay with being alone""

"I have a chronic illness. How can I learn how to live w/ acceptance, peace, instead of resentment and fear","I‚Äôm a female in my mid 30‚Äôs and I became ill 8 years ago.

Help me understand rebirth,"Hey guys,I'm struggling with the Buddhist concept of reincarnation. Please let me know if my understanding of it, which is as follows, is correct:

1. As there is no individual soul, no individual identity (or soul) transmigrates after death
2. What is subject to reincarnation is the karmic effect. Our deeds, good, and and neutral, shape and influence the karmic ""load"" or ""mass"" around us
3. This karmic baggage stops changing but lives on after our death, as the chain of causes and effects that we had put in motion before we pass, will still influence lives of other living beings, living and about to be born. Is that correct?
4. However, it seems like the actual, traditional teaching on rebirth is different, and it points out that rebirth is both individual and its centre is consciousness. What is meant by that is that rebirth is not diluted in other lives ( as I described in point 2.) but whatever is passed on, passes to a singular new being in its entirety. And what is reincarnated is not just karmic influence, but actual consciousness. Thus, in rare instances, some beings are able to connect with their previous incarnations.I find it hard to reconcile such approach to this concept with my rational mind. Is my interpretation of rebirth ((non-traditional, I reckon) acceptable and fund in some school o Buddhist thought?

The meditator who becomes Amitabha Reciter

The meditator who becomes Amitabha Reciter
Reciting Namo Amitabha Buddha, he was cured and entered the Pure Land Door

Âøµ‰ΩõÁóÖÁôí  ÂÖ•ÂáÄÂúüÈó®

Dharma Master Di Yi is a monk in the Xiang Ji Monastery in Changan, Shanxi. He is about seventy years old. In 1999, he was down with Oesophageal Cancer. The hospital notified him of his acute illness. After going back to the temple, he could not even come down from his bed, with his body all swollen. He could not breathe properly and groaned the whole day. Moreover, his blood vessels are hardened and there is no way to give him Analgesic injection. He suffered greatly. Master Di Yi felt that he could no longer be saved. So, he gave away all his money to the permanent dwelling. He asked them to conduct two sessions of prayers to relieve the sufferings of the hungry ghosts and to cross over his love ones, enemies and creditors after his death. He sought them to transfer merits to him so that he would not fall into the hungry ghost path. Master Di Yi had been practising meditation all the while. He seldom talked to people as he spent most of his time sitting in meditation. He had no faith in the Pure Land Sect. Even at the hour when he was facing death, he did not even seek to attain a rebirth by reciting the Buddha‚Äôs Name. Instead, he sought to die faster. Master Chang Zheng advised him to recite Namo Amitabha Buddha. He said, ‚ÄòOh! It is my fault that I did not put in effort in my cultivation. Now, I have no control over my births and deaths. What is the use to call out to Namo Amitabha Buddha? I do not think it will work‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äô



After further exhortation by Master Chang Zheng, Master Di Yi started to recite the Buddha‚Äôs Name once in a while. Chang Zheng Shi moved to his room to take care of him throughout the day and night, feeding him food and water, washing him up. Chang Zheng Shi took care of his pooping and peeing with no complaints at all. Most important of all, he always recite Namo Amitabha Buddha with him, encouraging him to give himself up to Amitabha Buddha. Di Yi Master moaned and recited, ‚ÄòAi yo! Amitabha Buddha. It is real suffering! Why am I still alive? If I am not a monk, I would have committed suicide. Amitabha Buddha, do come quickly. I have enough of this pain. Aiyo, aiyo, Amitabha Buddha, please let me die!‚Äô‚Ä¶

Three months passed by and Master Di Yi was getting better. He was cured of his illness and the swelling subsided.  From then onward, he renounced the zen meditation and continued to practise the Pure Land Dharma, reciting Namo Amitabha Buddha exclusively. Besides, he also exhorted others to recite Namo Amitabha Buddha exclusively, to bring forth the mind to seek a rebirth. Very often he would say this, ‚ÄòNo more meditation, no more   Sutras learning. I truly want to recite Namo Amitabha Buddha only‚Ä¶.‚Äô (recorded by Master Jing Hong,23rd August, 2001)

A comment:

Amitabha recitation is foremost in merits and virtues as it is the full merits and virtues which is accomplished by the Buddha for the sake of rescuing all living beings. If we only want to cultivate our merits and virtues, very often our good roots are with leakage. When can we truly accomplish the full merits and virtues? We mundane men are very arrogant and boastful as we do not want to rely on the Buddha. That is why we suffer acutely. Most grateful to Namo Amitabha Buddha",Buddhism,1705434962.0,t3_198c6dy,0.7,4
Does a Buddhist have to be an absolute pacifist?,"I‚Äôve been getting into Buddhist philosophy over the past few months, I‚Äôve been practicing meditation and reading The Heart of The Buddha‚Äôs Teaching by Thich Nhat Hanh, etc. But I‚Äôve been wondering whether I can truly commit to this philosophy if I‚Äôm not an absolute pacifist, something I don‚Äôt believe I could ever be. Obviously, violence should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. Even if you‚Äôre being attacked, you should try to retreat to safety if you can, but sometimes you have to use violence to defend yourself, even if it involves lethal force. Most pacifists concede this, I think.

But even more broadly, I‚Äôm ideologically a communist, and so I believe that armed struggle to overthrow the capitalist order which routinely impoverishes and kills people, is a form of self defense. Same with armed struggle by colonized people to achieve liberation. So, I don‚Äôt know how to reconcile these two things. Non violence is a worthwhile personal philosophy I think, but I‚Äôve always avoided violence anyway. But if I decide that armed struggle is always wrong, well then I‚Äôd essentially be abandoning my ideology. 

What I find appealing in Buddhism is mindfulness, clean living, moral discipline, cleansing the mind of hateful or negative thoughts, etc. I know this a very surface level understanding of Buddhism but I‚Äôm a beginner, so bear with me. But I can‚Äôt talk myself out of the idea that violence is sometimes necessary, not even just on an interpersonal level.

Being subjected to extortion/coercion,"Hey, I'm wondering how I should skillfully react in this situation. 

I have a rare severe hearing hypersensitivity that leads to prolonged pain and severe stress when being exposed to daily noise (like shouting, banging, dog barking, etc.). It also worsens permanently with too much exposure. This unfortunately forced me to isolate myself from society as most situations outside my home can become dangerously loud for me. It also results in specific requirements for living in an appartment (it must be super quiet). 

Now the rent of my appartment has been cancelled and the date where I have to leave the appartment is the end of February 2024. In my country you have the right to ask the court for an extension of your rent which can be up to 4 years. The chance that I get 2 years or more is high as besides my illness there is also a severe shortage of appartments around where I live. I have already filed the documents to the court including a very detailed explanation of my illness, the date for the preceeding attempt at conciliation will be on February 8th. 

My landlord (new one since December) wants to renovate the whole house and doesn't want to wait for 2 years or more, so he told me in a letter that he would start with renovating parts of the house at the beginning of February, unless I waive my right for extension, in which case he would grant me an extension until the end of March 2024 and delay the renovation until I'm out. It is impossible for me to stay in the house during the time it is being renovated due to my hypersensitivity, so I would be forced to stay somewhere else from 6:30 in the morning to about 18:00 in the evening during weekdays (I don't work at the moment). This is very difficult as I could stay more or less nowhere without risking a worsening of my state. Finding an appropriate appartment until the end of March 2024 on the other hand is also next to impossible. 

I am very fortunate that my parents offered up to allow me to stay at their home for a while (which is subpar and stressful for us all though since I need a lot of accomodation when being around others). At the same time I am furious at the behaviour of my new landlord as he is essentially ok sending me to my doom (either too much noise, or having nowhere to go / being homeless). If my health weren't so fragile and susceptible to potential retaliation I would have him prosecuted for coercion. So I'm left with the unpleasant option of just agreeing to his proposal and not fight at all. It makes me feel bitter.

Does anyone have some thoughts what kind of attitude could help here or any other advice? Thanks for reading my venting, it's a tough pill to swallow.

Consumerism,"As a beginner, I've been using my research to create a list of buddhist inspired ways to live a better and more connected life. We're not monks and so I am often confused on how to apply the teachings in a modern world where we engage a lot more.

The first one is: 

""In a consumer-driven society, people often find identity and happiness in material possessions. We should practice mindful consumption. Understand that possessions are temporary and derive true happiness from experiences and relationships rather than material goods.""

This also encompasses trying to live a minimalistic life, but also not denying myself of things that can benefit me. I am just struggling where to draw the line. 

For example, exercise equipment lasts a lifetime. A few articles of clothing or a nice haircut isn't the end of the world if not in excess. Taking pride in our appearance is natural. I also don't think purchasing video game consoles, etc, is anti-mindful if you understand impermanence, balance and moderation, and are still taking the time to self-reflect, meditate, and be present.

I recycle old wax to make candles. I am mindful how my diet affects the environment. I don't splurge or over-indulge where I can help it. I'm always looking to be mindful with my purchases but don't vilify small pleasures.

Realisation that only this Now moment exists.,"So I had something click as I was riding the subway yesterday, I had not slept that night lol.  


  
But as I was riding seeing some people on their phones, some talking and people moving, it kinda occured to me that there might be no free will.  


  
Not that there is no 'free will' but rather that there is no doer and there was a natural flow that moved things, things happen spontenaously without any one's control.  


  
One for example cannot control when a thought arises to do something or think about something, it just happens.

  
So what I realised is that I do not basically control what is happening, but not just that,  


  
I also realised that I always try to grasp at things, I try to not lose the past, memories or ideas that I identify with yet I also jump into the future.  


  
And the reason was this constant struggle to maintain an identity and a continuity in this world.  


  
As I moved with these ideas, another idea struck me, how do I know the past exists?  


  
Yes, I have memories but even these are fleeting and fade.  


  
As I thought about this, It struck me that everything is impermanent.  


  
Even if you experienced the most amazing day possible, that day will fade and when it fades, it's as if it never existed.  


  
Things pass and time washes way all experiences but I was always trying to grasp things in this flow of experiences, which is impossible since experiences always change and move.  


  
I realised all these things, these happenings are impermanent.  


  
But its then that I was struck by another idea, All these experiences Move and Change But the Present moment is always there, its always Here.  


  
That in which these impermanent experiences arise is permanent.  


  
This Now moment is always here and its always the same, things appear and disappear but its always in this very moment

  
I realised that if I wanted contentment and peace, instead of grasping experiences, I should try to grasp this Now moment and try to be with it.  


  
I also thought what if this now moment was before the world?

  
Meaning the world itself appears in this Now moment and this Now moment is the Dao itself  (I don't know the name that buddhists use)  


  
As I was thinking it also occured to me that there might be no ""me""  


  
These streams of thought I call 'me' is not for 'me' to own, it arises and moves spontenaously  


  
In summary, I realised this Now moment is where all experience appears and is what should be grasped to be free of experiences or to have the permanence that experiences don't have.  


  
Which is funny because this Now moment cannot be grasped yet it cannot be lost either, you are always in it.

Do they believe that we have a changing, non-fixed soul? 
Or that we have a soul that is somehow not permanent?
Or that we do not have a soul at all?
 If the latter, do they believe that the soul is of the same reality / existence as a dream or illusion, or that it does not have any reality at all?",Buddhism,1705419971.0,t3_1985xb0,0.58,2

"If there is no self that exists separate from experience, then why is the cessation of dukkha desirable ?","I am new to buddism. So new, that I don‚Äôt know that it would be truthful to call myself a bhuddist, though I would like to be. 

As I have been studying, this question has been bothering me and I have yet to find an answer to it: I believe I understand the idea that there is no self beyond your experience. Change and volition are required for life, and so that change and volition require that life continues, so, rebirth. In rebirth, it is no aspect of the self that is reborn, but a simple continuation of the change and volition that continues into the next life. We are not the same person in our next life, just like are not the same person from one moment to the next. It is just the continuation of a pattern. 

Dukkha is caused by thirst, and in finding truth and liberating ourselves of this thirst, we can achieve nirvana and the cessation of dukkha. What I don‚Äôt understand is why this is a good thing to work torwards ?

 If there is no self, and acheiving truth liberates us from dukkha, then surely any aspirations for truth are also aspirations for a final death of sorts, a desire to end this life and not continue into the next one. If the cycle of rebirth ends for you, and there is no self beyond the experiences we have in life, then is the choice to discover nirvana not just a peaceful suicide of sorts ? We give up dukkha, but also everything good.",Buddhism,1705376404.0,t3_197szau,0.7,5
"Hope, fear, death, loneliness, community and children.","Firstly, I have a lot of questions please don‚Äôt feel like you need to address them all.

I been reading Buddhist writings on fear I have tried to discuss the topic with a few people although it seems as stigmatised as death and loneliness. It seems to me that fear can be described as aversion to suffering as hope can be defined as grasping for happiness. I have been contemplating the eight worldly concerns and I am yet to find an example of my behaviour that is not motived one of them. I don‚Äôt believe that people can become so indifferent that they do things with no motivation at all. I have widened my understanding of what fear is and I think I am out of step with society, I think society‚Äôs view of fear is a bit extreme. There are tee-shirts and stickers branded ‚ÄòNo Fear‚Äô that are popular with young men, that now seem ridiculous to me. Just because you‚Äôre a base jumper doesn‚Äôt mean you have ‚Äòno fear‚Äô it just means you are brave when faced with intense fear or perhaps you underestimate the risk and are grasping on to the pleasure that excitement brings either way if they had ‚ÄòNo Fear‚Äô they wouldn‚Äôt need a parachute.

Is my understanding correct in that fear motivates nearly half of what people do?

I have read that fear of death is our largest fear and motivates much of our behaviour. I‚Äôm usure and would like comment, but perhaps fear often isn‚Äôt intense, people do mundane things like eating because on some level they hope for good health and fear death? 

Without fear of death humans would not exist is it just that we choose to ignore it because it‚Äôs to confronting? We use words like anxiety instead of experiencing intense fear, it‚Äôs called the fight or flight response, response to what other than fear?

Loneliness is defined as sadness because one has no friends or company. But isn‚Äôt the suffering of loneliness caused by fear. As babies we were dependent on others, we a drawn to stable partnerships to raise children, as tribes we survived as communities. Is loneliness a primal fear as fundamental as fear of death and required for our survival?

I have also heard that you cannot have hope without fear or fear without hope and that makes them two aspects of the same thing, is this understanding correct from the Buddhist viewpoint? Can you provide an example of having one without the other?

From a Buddhist point of view are all fears a result of our root fear of our or others in our community dying that is, fear of death? Does it make sense that the eight worldly concerns exist to help motivate us to thrive and survive in a community and reproduce? Finally, is it our true root hope that us and our community thrive and survive across generations?    ",Buddhism,1705376401.0,t3_197sz9p,0.67,1
The five clinging-aggregates ARE dukkha?,"In the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, the buddha claims that the 5 clinging-aggregates ARE dukkha.

Dialogue with Manjushri. Exerpt from the Vimalakirti Sutra.,"*This is a abridged and paraphrased excerpt from Vimalakirti Sutra that I wrote for personal study based on the version Translated by Burton Watson, and thought of sharing:*

„Éª Manjushri asked Vimalakirti: ""How should a Bodhisattva go about comforting and instructing another Bodhisattva who is ill?""

Vimalakirti responded: ""Guide him to understand the impermanence of the body, without encouraging him to despise or reject it. Enlighten him about the sufferings that the body may endure, but discourage him from seeking death as a solution. Teach him that the body is devoid of ego, yet inspire him to guide and support sentient beings. Share with him the concept of the body's emptiness, but refrain from discussing its ultimate extinction. Encourage him to reflect on past wrongdoings, but avoid dwelling on them. Instead, motivate him to utilize his own illness as a means to empathize with the suffering of others, recognizing the countless kalpas of their past struggles, and contemplate how he can bring benefit to all living beings. Remind him of the merit he has attained through religious practice, emphasizing the importance of leading a pure life and resisting feelings of worry or gloom. Encourage him to cultivate unwavering diligence, aspiring to become a master healer who can alleviate the ailments of the community. This is the approach a Bodhisattva should adopt when comforting and guiding a fellow Bodhisattva who is unwell, aiming to bring happiness to his heart.

This ailing Bodhisattva of ours despite being free from the sensations of pain and pleasure, willingly allows himself to experience them. Even though he has not fully attained enlightenment, he does not seek to eliminate these sensations within himself. Instead, when he feels pain in his own body, he directs his thoughts towards the suffering beings in the lower realms, and cultivates a profound sense of compassion. He tells himself, ""I have disciplined and controlled myself, and now I must guide and support other living beings!"" But he should simply rid them of their illnesses and not deprive them of anything, merely teaching and guiding them so they can cut off the source of illness.

What is meant by the source of illness? It means having troublesome entanglements. These entanglements are the very source of our suffering. And how do we let go of them? By realizing that there is nothing to cling to. When we stop grasping at things, we free ourselves from these troublesome entanglements. And what does it mean to realize that there is nothing to grasp at? It means to transcend dualistic views. Dualistic views arise when we perceive things as either internal or external. Let go of such views, and you will no longer cling to anything.

‚ÄúThough he moves in the threefold world, he does no injury to the Dharma-nature ‚Äî such is the practice of the bodhisattva. Even in the formless realm, he tirelessly works towards the salvation of countless living beings. In the realm of nonaction, he manifests himself in physical form to aid others. Though he avoids being consumed by passion, he ignites within himself the unwavering determination to perform virtuous deeds. Even though he engages in meditation, liberation, and deep concentration, he does not seek rebirth as a result of these practices. This is the way of the bodhisattva.

„Éª Manjushri inquired of Vimalakirti: ""How does the bodhisattva perceive living beings?"" Vimalakirti responded: Just as the wise perceive the reflection of the moon in water, or a face and form seen in a mirror; as the shimmering heat in a scorching season, or the echo that follows a cry,  like bubbles on the water  As shapes in the formless world, as remnants of earthly desires in a Buddha, as visions seen by a blind person,  as images in a dream after awakening  ‚Äîthis is how the bodhisattva perceives living beings.""

""Manjushri questioned: ""If the bodhisattva perceives beings in this manner, how can he show them compassion?""

‚ÄúHe shows them a compassion of serene extinction, as it leads to no rebirth; shows them a compassion that does not burn, as it is free from earthly desires; shows them a compassion that is impartial, just as the three existences of past, present, and future are impartial;  shows them a compassion that is completely natural, understanding that it arises without cause; shows them a compassion of enlightenment, which has only one flavor; shows them a compassion without any distinction, as it eliminates all favoritism; shows them great pity and compassion/guides them with the Great Vehicle. He shows them a compassion that never loses hope, recognizing that everything is empty and devoid of ego  shows them a compassion of wisdom, which always knows the right time; shows them a compassion of skillful means, with manifestations suited to every occasion.""",Buddhism,1705309156.0,t3_1974cky,0.8,8

In and out of psych wards. I have a lot of ambition and want to help others in the world though. So hopefully I get there. I‚Äôm young I get it.

I‚Äôm decently smart and creative, painfully so. I‚Äôm definitely capable of having multiple existential crises at the same time. Review all the philosophies of the world at once. Painful living, no answers. I recently remembered that I actually suffer severely from disassociation (depersonalization/derealization). So the odds are not looking good lol. Reality hasn‚Äôt felt real, I haven‚Äôt felt real. I‚Äôm always on the verge of losing my mind whilst doing simple tasks. 

My brain is in pain. I‚Äôm hoping when I‚Äôm in more favorable living circumstances, I‚Äôll lighten up. You see, I don‚Äôt really have the space to answer life‚Äôs greatest mysteries (I get it.. Buddhism is simple and you take what resonates with you). 

I guess I can meditate everyday but I read online somewhere that if you‚Äôre severely mentally ill - it may not be the best choice. Meditation turns into a required practice, 1 turns into 2. Silence then calls for chants. And so on and so on. My therapist said there‚Äôs other forms of meditation like listening to music. Idk what kind of advice I want. Idk what I‚Äôd like to hear.

I just know I can‚Äôt handle much. I don‚Äôt think I can be going to my Zen practice for a while. I wouldn‚Äôt even know what to prioritize, most definitely my therapy since they‚Äôre professionally trained. I mean I‚Äôll probably be upping my therapy to twice a week. Suffering from constantly losing your grip over reality for 15 years sucks. The funny part is I was diagnosed before and my memory gaps are so bad - I just remembered it now. Ain‚Äôt that a bih. 

I exercise, eat healthy, and sleep well. No drugs and I live a simple life too. Still - if I eat unhealthy or sleep too little .. it‚Äôs the end of my world and I repay for weeks to come. 

Idek what to make of things. Is it bad to have hope? Do I have a self? You see what I mean‚Ä¶ 

I get it unmoved and serene. Either you control your 24hrs or they control you. Literally I am losing my mind. My brain is physically deteriorating it isn‚Äôt some ‚Äúmental movie‚Äù. I get that I felt just even before Buddhism and meditation. Just no real answers. At this point I believe that we all make our own beliefs - have our own preferences when it comes to dogma.

I think I‚Äôve felt the strongest when I leaned into my therapy. Just kinda wish I can undo the fear I learned from Buddhism. I‚Äôll probably be better the more I stay away from group Zen practice. Not so sure. Not sure of much lol. ",Buddhism,1705298138.0,t3_1971hos,0.61,4

What if all I can muster is metta?,"**Background**: In many respects, I am close to being a Buddhist. What keeps me from fully embracing a practice is that I tend to obsess over metaphysics (nibbana, anatta, etc). I will admit that I am neurodivergent and that Buddhism quickly becomes something Not Very Buddhist-Like when my web-making brain gets ahold of it. The more I identify as Buddhist, the more I start to get stressed and scrupulous (Good Buddhist syndrome). Ironic, or telling, I know.

**Issue**: Even when I give up trying to 'be' a Buddhist, I still feel incredibly drawn to metta. Metta has gotten me closest to a transcendent, spiritual state than anything before. I see the instant good every time I do metta meditation. That being said, I feel like I don't have the right to practice it because I don't have the intention to take it further than that. I don't want nibbana right now (or ever maybe). Is metta something I can practice even if I don't want the ultimate goal of Buddhism? I can guess the answer, but even so, how can I give myself permission to benefit from metta?

Questions about the four noble truths and the noble eightfold path,"The [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Noble_Truths) says that the term ""Four Noble Truths"" is derived from the pali word ‚ÄúcaturƒÅriyasaccƒÅni‚Äù which means ‚ÄúThe Truths of the Noble Ones‚Äù. Its not the Truths themselves that are Noble. It is the ‚ÄúNoble Ones‚Äù that accept these truths, or by definition ""those that show high moral principles and ideals"", that accept these Truths. 

So my first question is, if the Four Noble Truths have to do with suffering and the cessation of suffering, what does that have to do with being ""Noble""?  It doesn't seem like there is a need to associate being ""Noble"" with identifying the causes of suffering and the way to cease suffering.

&#x200B;

When I enter the Eightfold Path from the Fourth Noble Truth, at face value, it looks like its mostly a prescriptive guide for how to live a righteous or ""noble"" life and doesn't have anything to do with ending suffering through the cessation of clinging.

So my second question is, how does practicing the Eightfold Path lead to the cessation of clinging?

"Each sentient being is like a sleeping potential buddha who is dreaming about inherent existence of self and of all phenomena, and deludedly believing the dream to be true‚Ä¶","Each sentient being is like a sleeping potential buddha who is dreaming about inherent existence of self and of all phenomena, and deludedly believing the dream to be true, and therefore they are trapping themself in samsara - their uncontrollably recurring rebirth with all of its uncertainty, dissatisfaction, problems, and suffering.

The practice of buddhism for a sentient being, is like the method for them to wake up from this beginningless deluded dream, by waking up to the reality of emptiness.  In other words, waking up to the reality of the ‚Äúlack‚Äú of inherent existence of self and of all phenomena, in order to be blissfully free from samsara, and further, in order to become a fully awakened blissfully omniscient buddha for the benefit of all sentient beings who are still dreaming.

So remember, you are not creating the reality of emptiness, you just have to become awake to it. Emptiness has always, and will always be the deepest nature of self, and of all phenomena - quite literally, it is the deepest nature of everything!

Being Unbothered By Experiences: MN 152: The Development of the Faculties,"---

Excerpted from

**[MN 152: IndriyabhƒÅvanƒÅsutta: The Development of the Faculties](https://suttacentral.net/mn152/en/sujato)** 

---

‚ÄúUttara, does PƒÅrƒÅsariya teach his disciples the development of the faculties?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe does, Master Gotama.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut how does he teach it?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaster Gotama, it‚Äôs when the eye sees no sight and the ear hears no sound. That‚Äôs how PƒÅrƒÅsariya teaches his disciples the development of the faculties.‚Äù 

...

Knowing this, the Buddha addressed Venerable ƒÄnanda, ‚ÄúƒÄnanda, the development of the faculties taught by PƒÅrƒÅsariya is quite different from the supreme development of the faculties in the training of the Noble One.‚Äù 

...

When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking come up in them. They understand: ‚ÄòLiking, disliking, and both liking and disliking have come up in me. That‚Äôs conditioned, coarse, and dependently originated. But this is peaceful and sublime, namely equanimity.‚Äô Then the liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking that came up in them cease, and equanimity becomes stabilized. It‚Äôs like how a person with clear eyes might open their eyes then shut them; or might shut their eyes then open them. Such is the speed, the swiftness, the ease with which any liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking at all that came up in them cease, and equanimity becomes stabilized.

Non-dual Nature of Reality [Serious],"How did the awakened know that he was awakened? ""I, the witnessing consciousness, realize my own consciousness."" This actually violates Nagarjuna's own principle of anti-self-reflectivity.

Empirically, the world is dualistic. Subject and object exist. There is something other than consciousness that the consciousness cognizes. Experiences exist in this temporal, empirical reality. So, in what sense is the world non-dual?

If everything is Shunya(emptiness), even the dual nature of subject and object then who is the witness of this Shunya(emptiness)? And if something is the witness of this Shunya(emptiness) then it itself contradicts the non-dual nature of reality.

What to do when the teacher giving the dharma talks seems... incompetent,"Im not saying they \*are\* incompetent, and I understand that, all things considered, if a person is credentialed and generally respected as a dharma teacher, they probably \*arent\* in an objective sense.

Theres this series of talks I have been meaning to get to, by a respected teacher, but when I listen to some of the examples she gives, I find myself rolling my eyes and grinding my teeth.

I get as far as, this is probably a me-problem, not a them-problem, inasmuch as they are a teacher who has studied for decades, and is known to know the subject (so they arent at fault) but when I listen to them I feel like they just have some problematic ways of looking at the material they are teaching (probably my brain putting that on them).

But what to actually do about that?

The problem is the talks series is long, like 40 x 90 minute talks. And I am at talk 2 and reaching for the off switch.

In regard to the situation, am I better off listening to this person who I find annoying, or am I better off moving to a different set of teachings that I can listen to with less... aversion?

Also to add, what are the major determinants in which Buddha's / Bodhisattva's name one should choose to chant/recite and how fast one can see results?

I was told it would be whichever one I could hold for the whole day if I was told to choose one. My issue with this is that I feel more connection with certain Buddhas/Bodhisattvas (subtly) even if I can hold another name longer/more often, so I wanted to ask for more thoughts on this on how I should pick.

I know I can choose more than one, but I'd rather focus on one (maybe two at most).

Also each name I recite sometimes gives different responses, as I know different mantras have different functions, or similarly how during a funeral we recite Amitabha's name and not say Medicine Master's. Same thing about Sutras each having different focuses I guess.

I know I have some breathing issues and just a weaker body in general but I'm not sure if this is also the norm for healthy or most people in general.  


It is easier when I chant silently with my mouth and tongue moving (called **Vajra recitation**), but because I end up inhaling some air through the mouth it also affects my breathing negatively since nasal breathing/and exhaling is ideal and healthiest to my knowledge.

  
Also because of my tight breathing/shortness of breath, I can't sustain long chanting (aloud), are there any tips on how I can improve my chanting/recitation practices?  
I would say Vajra recitation so far is the best for me in terms of not being short on breath, but chanting aloud is the easiest to hear my recitations clearly and distinctly which to my knowledge is what one should be doing when reciting the Buddha's name, or doing mantras (**please correct me if I am wrong**).

MahƒÅsthƒÅmaprƒÅpta Bodhisattva's practice of interpenetration through Buddha-contemplation (Nianfo),"The Chapter of Bodhisattva Dashizhi
(MahƒÅsthƒÅmaprƒÅpta)‚Äôs Perfect & Complete Realization of Nianfo SamƒÅdhi
(an extract from Chapter Five of the ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama S≈´tra)
„ÄäÂ§ßÂäøËá≥Ëè©Ëê®Âøµ‰ΩõÂúÜÈÄöÁ´†„Äã

Dharma Prince Dashizhi (Mahasthamaprapta), together with his group offifty-two Bodhisattvas, rose from his seat, prostrated himself with his head at the feet of the Buddha and declared: ‚ÄúI still remember that in the remotest of kalpas countless as the sands in the Ganges, there was a Buddha named Amitabha. In that kalpa, there were twelve TathƒÅgatas who succeeded each other respectively, the last of whom was named the
Buddha Whose Light Surpasses that of the Sun and Moon. That (Those)
Buddha(s) taught me Buddha-contemplation SamƒÅdhi.

For instance, if one concentrates his mind on someone else while the latter always forgets him, both may meet and see each other as if they don‚Äôt meet at all. However, if both are keen on thinking of each other, their keenness
will grow from one incarnation to another until they become inseparable like a body and its shadow.

The TathƒÅgatas in the ten directions have compassion for all living beings
and always think of them, like a mother who never ceases thinking of her
son. If the son runs away, her thoughts of him will not help. But if he also
thinks of her with the same keenness, they will not be separated in spite of
the passing transmigration.

If the hearts of living beings remember and think of the Buddha, they are
bound to behold Him in their present or future incarnations. They will not be far from the Buddha and thus without expedients, their hearts will naturally open.

They are like those whose bodies, perfumed by incense, give out fragrance,
hence the name Adorned by Fragrance and Light. From my fundamental
cause-ground, with the heart of mindfulness of AmitƒÅbha Buddha, I have
realized the dharma of non-arising (anutpattika-dharma-k·π£ƒÅnti).

Now I help all living beings of this world to return to the Pure Land through
being mindful of AmitƒÅbha Buddha. As the Buddha now asks about the best

"A question about ""AnattƒÅ"" and semantics.","In Buddhism, there is no permanent ""self"".No soul, no one substance to refer to when describing ""oneself"". We only have a set of factors, which together produce the illusion of ""self"".

This creates semantical difficulties when we want to discuss these topics clearly, leaving a lot of room for interpretation of what was actually said.The closest word I found to describe this set of factors, the concept of self is ""attƒÅ"" or ""attan"", but is there a one-word western alternative?

The reason I ask is I'm working on a game inspired by Buddhism.As you enter the game, you are welcomed by a creature (the creature is an illusion your mind produced).   
The first 2 phrases of the creature are:  
\- Hello! I've been waiting for you.  
\- You are new soul and I am going to help you on your journey.

I used the word ""soul"" as a placeholder for now and I'm looking for a proper alternative to describe the impermanent concept of ""self"" in a way, where both newcomers to buddhism won't say ""WTF you just said?"" and veteran buddhists won't be offended by the incorrect wording.Words like ""human"" won't be applicable, as the game explores different states (e.g. Antara-bhƒÅva).

On impermenance,"I recently lost some long time friends. Friend group which i have known for years. Few buddies i've known for 1/3 of my life. We grew apart. Met less and less.

How to Learn More About Theravada/Mahayana/Vajrayana? Do I Have To Choose?,"I'm very pleased by Buddhist teaching thus far, and even as an eclectic polytheist I realize its value above other traditions on the topic of inner pain. I'm severely disabled so I know the real value of such teachings. Just knowing that my pain is escapable through mindfullness is great, and the scientific, neurobiological benefits of meditation are really helping me. If there is any other practice that involves such a great act in Buddhism I'd love to know about it, whether Mahayana, Thravada, Vajrayana, or practices present in all sects.

 I think I learned that Siddhartha Gautama was (as far as I'm aware) a practicing Hindu, but merely had a more secular lense on the religion, rejected the caste system and had some ideas derived from Hinduism that make sense even today. I desperately want to know more, I don't want to be a poser, I want to learn as much about Buddhism as an average native Shinto-Buddhist syncretic in Japan would know, and even more if at all possible, even if I have to learn new languages. I want to form similar belief systems as the Japanese have for people that worship my ancestral pantheons (Germanic, Ibero-Roman and Kiche \[Mayan\]) and to walk in the eight-fold path until the end of my days.

I also want to note that the tradition of Bodhisattvas is absolutely amazing, it gives real hope that there is a path to becoming truly good and attaining wisdom great enough to cause the universe to hold you higher in esteem than a typical person. Real spiritual meritocracy really isn't present in the religions my culture generally practices. I wonder if this belief is present in all three schools, or do I have to choose one?

If there's any way I could be a part of all three traditions I would do so. I would love to mix and match and see what works and what I should believe and do even if they don't.

Is it offensive if I don't bow at the start of mediation sessions in this Buddhist hermitage?,"
I discovered a little Buddhist hermitage near where I live in England. They hold an open 1 hour meditation session led by monks which they advertise on their website. 
I am really interested in joining these meditation sessions. I have limited knowledge of Buddhism, but when I joined the first session I realised that they start and end the sessions with bowing in front of the Buddha statue/the monk and some chanting.

I am not comfortable with the idea of bowing, so I sat silently without bowing when they bowed. 

My question is, would my behaviour be offensive to the monks and other people present? 
I would really love to continue going to these sessions, but I know that I will not bowing, do you think this is something that is tolerated in settings like this or not? I wouldn't like to go if I will be causing offence or discomfort.

For context this is place is linked to traditions in north east Thailand from what I understood.

I know that I could probably ask them but there was no talking and the monks did not stay long before or after the meditation session, and it didn't feel like discussions with the monks was encouraged. Also, I don't know if I may get a polite answer while still causing offence by not bowing.

Thanks for your insights.


Edit: additional context: due to my religious upbringing I consider bowing the utmost expression of worshipping a deity. That's the only meaning it has in my mind. I know it is a lot more nuanced than this in Buddhism, but that's how it is set in my mind. I am still relatively observant of my religion, but I see genuine value in learning and practicing mindfulness meditation in Buddhist settings, but I don't want to  ""become Buddhist"".
So, in a way I am asking if this is a tolerated form of engaging with Buddhist thought, or is it pretty much you have to take the full context and practices.

Dwelling in the present moment when going through hardships ...,"One of the themes that keeps coming up again and again for all the books I read on the Buddha's teachings is the idea of impermanence and focusing on the breath in order to help us be in the present moment. 

I understand how this might help somebody who is in a situation where the past is filled with regrets or anger. The future is filled with fear or uncertainty. The past is gone, the future has not come.

 Thinking about how everything is subject to change, how nothing is permanent, and focusing on the present moment where things might not be as bad can definitely help ease the fears, stress, and anxiety. At the monastery that I visit, the monks usually ask us ""are you always experiencing this .... Are you experiencing X negative emotion right now?"" During the process of meditation. The answer is usually no, but some people's present moment might be full of pain. 

 When things get really really bad in the present moment ... Wouldn't putting all your focus in the current present moment suffering just be like shooting that second arrow?

If your present moment is full of fear. If your present moment is a terrible moment. Perhaps you are at death's door, maybe you're going through physical abuse or trauma, maybe even being actively punched in the face right now, with nothing you could do to stop the punishment or pain, perhaps beaten in their prison cell, why would you try to focus on this present moment? 

I get that the present moment is all there really is, but I think for some people their day-to-day existence, their present moments can be filled with so much horror, so much pain and suffering, that the only thing that keeps them from ending their lives here and now is to dwell elsewhere, even if it's just an illusion.",Buddhism,1705136286.0,t3_195juoi,0.83,4

Vipassana tought by Goenka,"I want to know what Buddhist think of the Vipassana Movement of Goenka?  
For me, Goenka is one of my heroes and i have very few. 

I am interested in Buddhism since the last 30 years of my life. For me, the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path are true and i believe that they can lead you to nirvana, which is not a place after you are death, but a state of mind in this life that is free from suffering.

In my journey, i read many books of the dalay lama and other ""higher"" Buddhist and went to a Buddhist center of the diamond way Buddhism for three years. I stopped going to the center, because it looked for me more like a religion and something like Scientology.

There where two key experiences why i left the center. One was a big gathering in germany with a high Buddhist of the Karma Kagyu school. I did not went but after the gathering i witnessed a event that i really disliked. Two persons talked about the gathering. One was there, one not. The person who was there, told the other person that he took notes about the gathering that he can provide. Than an other person intervened and told them, that the high Buddhist of the gathering would cry if he know that someone took nodes, because it is an oral tradition and also, the person that was not at the gathering, is not at a level that the teaching of the high Buddhist is for him.  
For me, it sounded like scientology, where it is forbidden to tell lower scientologiest the crap of Xenu the extraterrestrial ruler, because they will not understand it in the moment.

An other event was were some member of the center had a dying child and we watched a video about buddhist dying from Lama Ole Nydahl. That it is best for you to sit with your head to the sky in the moment of dying, because your ""soul"" can leave your body better and this gives you a better start in your next life. For me, this is made up crap with no evidence.

But i really missed the meditation in the center and therefor i ended in a 10 day vipassna retreat of Goenka. There i learned to meditate better in this 10 days than in three years in the center. For me, the vipassana retreat ticked all my boxes. In the Diamond Way Buddhism the main meditation is about the 16 Karmapa. Where you ""imagine"" that the Karmapa ""sits"" in front of you with his black crown.  
In the Vipassana Movement, you have two meditations. The Anapana meditation (Breath) and the Vipassana meditation (Body scan). For me, i think that Goenka is right about this meditation. In the meditation of the diamond way, you are not in the moment. You create an illusion and while you can get calm and more concentrated with it, you are not able to reach your subconscious and train it to lose the normal pattern of your mind. Which is necessary to reach nirvana.

For me, the vipassana meditation is a neurofeedback therapy that buddha developed 2500 years before we understand what a neurofeedback therapy is. My problem with my journey into buddhism, was, that it was much more intellectual than practical. But your subconscious doesn't care about your intellectual understanding. It is still reacting like it reacted all your life. Yes, you know that the key to a better live is to have equanimity, but how you you make your subconscious equanimous? 

This can be done with the ""neurofeedback therapy"" called vipassna. With vipassana, you get more and more aware of your body feelings. Then, you have the three daily hours of sitting of strong determination in the retreat. Where you try not to move for one hour. This is like torture. But this is where the ""magic"" happens and you can retrain your subconscious. 

The hour starts with singing and some instructions. Than it is silence and after 55 minutes, Goenka sings again and the hour ends. After getting more and more aware about your body feelings, you are getting aware, that in the moment you start to wish that Goenka starts singing, so your torture is near an end, your situation gets worse. But when you have equanimity with your situation, your situation gets instantly much better. The torture like situation helps you find the place in your brain to be equanimous. It is not the intellectual understanding that if you have equanimity, the situation is better for you, it is a real experience of this fact. 

Normally, your subconscious let you react with flight or fight in unpleasant situations. You crave that your situation change and now you and your subconscious learn that your cravings and your aversions make your situation worse. That accepting the situation like it is, makes it much better.

For me, this made my life much much better. For example. I had a life long enemy. The cold. Every time i got cold, it was like horror for me. Every winter in my life was crap. In my first retreat, i lost this enemy. The retreat was in the winter time and there was snow. Normally, i hated it leaving the meditation hall to getting to the sleeping quarters. It was cold. After my third sitting of strong determination, i went out of the hall and it was not like before. I was really shocked. I went to a park bench and sit there in a t-shirt and watched the cold on my skin. I cried because it was not the horror i had all my life anymore. I had equanimity with the situation and therefor the cold was only there but i did not blow it up to horror like i used to. Since then, every winter was a piece of cake for me. Cold is now a normal feeling and not an enemy anymore.

Next week, i have my forth retreat. In the last one, i reached a point, where i reached total equanimity to a degree i never reached before. Because i once broke my tailbone, my tailbone really hurts after a few days meditating for 10 hours a day. In the last retreat, there was no difference between a nice feeling of joy in my hands and the burning pain in my tailbone. I was totally equanimous with the situation and was watching the feelings without judging them. It was really strange to have the same feeling of interesting observing without judging for a nice feeling and for a bad feeling.

I think this is the way to nirvana and i thing the vipassna retreats from Goenka are much more effective teaching your subconscious buddhas insides than any other method i can imagine.

Actors and the Hell of Laughter,"So, since actors are getting karma leading to the hell of laughter, do we assume musicians get the same?

In other words, does the reading stand in terms of purpose (entertainers are bad). Or does it stand prescriptively (as *only* applying to actors)? 

I think the stuff about actors getting bad karma precludes my involvement in Buddhism. It shows how local and provincial the religion is. It's a cultural admonition that only applies to that time, so what do we do with it now?

A Wave of Teen Suicides Stopped by Amitabha Buddha‚Äôs Name,"# A Wave of Teen Suicides Stopped by Amitabha Buddha‚Äôs Name

by [**Dharma Master Jing Zong**](https://plbi.org/?author=7) [November 20, 2021](https://plbi.org/?p=304)

An Indian native woman from Tulalip (about 60 km north of Seattle) of the Washington State, came to take refuge in Vancouver on 29th October, 2016. Her name is Verna Hill, about 50 in age. She mentioned about a school shooting case that took place in a high school of her district on 24 October, 2014. The shooter was a grandson of one of the tribal elders ‚Äì and her nephew. Because he didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúgo alone,‚Äù he invited his cousins (who were about the same age as himself) to meet at the school cafeteria, and shot them. Four were fatally wounded, and another was left in critical condition. The shooter then took his own life. The incident was reported in the media: Hundreds of people prayed in the church for the victims and their dependents on that day. But the horror did not end there. Verna then recounted how, beginning in April of this year (2016), a rash of suicide attempts broke out among the teens of the tribe. Over a period of twelve weeks, a growing number of these attempts proved successful, with several of the teens making similar posts on Facebook before committing suicide: ‚ÄúI have lost so many friends, I can no longer bear to live. I want to go with them because life in this world is meaningless.‚Äù Ominously, they also wrote: ‚ÄúI can hear them calling me, whispering in my ear.‚Äù¬†

As news of these events spread, so did the anxiety among the parents of the tribe. Everyone paid close attention to their children, growing frantic if one of them went missing for even an hour. Within just a few months, six teenagers ended their lives by hanging themselves. No one knew who would be next. The alarm and panic in the community were at fever pitch, and none of the local health care professionals, despite their best efforts, seemed capable of preventing yet another tragedy.¬†

Native Indians in this region worship their ancestors as part of their traditional, shamanistic beliefs. Because many of their ancestors have generated heavy karmic debts through the offense of killing, they have been reincarnated in the ghost realm and have been unable to find deliverance. In the case of this school shooting, the situation is even more complicated, as the victims were in an acute state of fear at the time of death. Their sense of betrayal and rage meant that their spirit-incarnations continually sought relief by returning to their community and becoming destructively entangled in the lives of their peers. Some months prior to her taking refuge, Verna reported these matters to Nadia „ÄÇ¬†

Some months prior to her taking refuge, Verna reported these matters to lay practitioner Nadia Liu (Buddhist name: Fozhang), a Chinese herbal doctor originally from Taiwan. Verna is the patient of Nadia, who is also the doctor of many of the relatives of the teens who committed suicide.¬†

Lay practitioner Fozhang found this situation to be urgent and told them, ‚ÄúYou should practice Nianfo. Reciting Namo Amituofo should relieve your suffering.‚Äù She gave them some Amitabha recitation machines, and invited them to recite along while playing the recitation at home. Certain members of the community were receptive to the idea; they gratefully received lay practitioner Fozhang‚Äôs instructions and began to practice. There was even one 28-year- old woman who told how she once recited over 2,000 times in one day.¬†

About four weeks prior to this writing, Verna told Lay practitioner Fozhang that the months-long wave of teen suicides had, at last, come to an end.¬†

Verna said to me, ‚ÄúI came to Vancouver to listen to the Buddha‚Äôs teaching, and you give me hope that I truly can touch another world: the Land of Bliss. Through this teaching, I was able to send these blessings to my ancestors ‚Äì and those helpless teens ‚Äì that they could all be delivered to the Pure Land and liberated from their suffering.‚Äù¬†

As Nadia narrated this to me in Chinese, Verna could not keep from sobbing. She understood well the inconceivable power of Amitabha-recitation, and her tears flowed freely in gratitude and release. All the karmic entanglements of the past few hundred years were resolved, and her ancestors were delivered and liberated. It was for this reason that Verna took refuge in Vancouver.¬†

Since taking refuge, Verna regularly recites ‚ÄúNamo Amituofo.‚Äù People in her tribe are curious about the gold-plated Amitabha-Name pendant that she is wearing. They ask her what it is and touch it with their hands.¬†

Amitabha-recitation is so simple. All people, without discrimination, are favored by Amitabha Buddha and can enjoy the benefits of his grace.¬†The members of this Indian tribe had not studied the Dharma and knew virtually nothing about Buddhism. They were totally unfamiliar with Amitabha Buddha, and yet they received the most efficacious response from him through the recitation of his name.¬†

Faith in, and reliance on, Amitabha Buddha is not a kind of religion, and does not interfere with any other religious belief. Anyone who recites his name will be cleared of their karmic offenses, embraced by his light and reborn in the Pure Land. This is all through the power of Namo Amitabha. His name is a simple fact ‚Äì a truth that anyone can put to the test. As in Verna‚Äôs case, proof of its effectiveness will not be found lacking.¬†

No matter what religion one believes in, we all have basic needs. We all need to eat, drink, exercise, and enjoy the sunlight. Truly, we all need to recite Amitabha‚Äôs name, as well. (End)",Buddhism,1705091574.0,t3_19550tz,0.75,10
is karma like money jars?,"i‚Äôll explain:

is it like money jars 
- you have 2 jars, one for food and one for bad
- all actions you do will go into either one 
- some actions are worth more, so increase in the amount of money put in there 
- the amount of money is calculated at the end of your life to see whether you have more in one of the other
- basically like having a swear jar and a complement jar

Chanting in Tibetan,"Hello all, I‚Äôve recently started attending meditations at my local Tibetan center and have been getting a lot of benefit from it, but I have asked the leadership there a LOT of questions so I thought I‚Äôd bring this one to Reddit first, before I trouble them again;

The chanting before (and sometimes during) meditation is, obviously, in Tibetan. There are cheat sheets for us to follow along but I still struggle with the pronunciation and timing of the chants. Should I be silent during these moments until I know how the chant goes, or should I be *attempting* to vocalize correctly even though I will be off-kilter from everyone else? 

Like I said, I can ask leadership about this but I have asked them soooooo much already, I was hoping someone here would know what is typically preferred and respectful. ü™∑",Buddhism,1705077558.0,t3_194zder,0.93,12

Is anything real?,"Forgive what is probably a rudimentary question - I am just beginning my journey of trying to deeply understand Buddhism.

I don't think I am fully grasping the concept of emptiness. Does this mean that nothing is real? Nothing really exists? What is the reality I interact with daily? Is the earth real? Is the table in my kitchen real? Am I really here right now?

Or does this teaching mean that material things exist in changing states but that everything is devoid of meaning? And if that's the case, what's the point of doing or making anything? Is life itself empty and therefore pointless?

I am struggling with this concept of ultimate meaninglessness. Why keep on living? Why do anything at all? Just because the wheel of rebirth will keep turning?

Why can‚Äôt people seem to progress past the first noble truth?,"I‚Äôm so tired of people telling me that Buddhism is the most depressing and pessimistic of all religions 

It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm out here proselytizing but I live in a very religiously diverse location so I‚Äôm around Christians, Muslims, Scientologist, Mormons and even Hindus 


So many people try to throw Buddhism under the bus by using the same played out criticism that the Buddha himself had to correct the followers of other sects on which is‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.Buddhism is nihilistic, pessimistic, and life negating 

Its like the other 3 noble truths don‚Äôt exist 

The Buddha found a way out of suffering 

He found the cure to suffering 

That‚Äôs not pessimistic that gives us hope and optimism 

Acknowledging that life can be unbearable isn‚Äôt a negative thing only by acknowledging the problem can we then work towards a solution to it 

That‚Äôs exactly what the Buddha did 

I just don‚Äôt get it how people can accuse Buddhism of being some emo pity party when those same religions have the most terrible beliefs themselves 

I remember going to church and being told that the purpose of my life was to worship god and be a vessel for him to use for his own glory 

What I want didn‚Äôt matter my pain and suffering didn‚Äôt matter because I was just a pawn in God‚Äôs cosmic plan 

And then it didn‚Äôt help that I was under constant threat of the end times and wondering whether or not I would be in the rapture 

I remember crying as a kid because my mom told me Jesus would return before I was an adult and I was sad that the world would be destroyed before I got to live out my whole life 

Talk about nihilistic‚Ä¶talk about life negating 


Luckily my mom bought me a religious dictionary so I could learn about all the false non Christian religions so I could debate nonbelievers and win them over to Christ‚Ä¶.it had a big section on Buddhism that i read over and over again because life finally made sense to me!!!!

Worthwhile employers to work for? (Question tailored to those who work in tech but are also Buddhist),"I‚Äôve been working in tech for nearly 15 years now. Most of the work I‚Äôve done, although complex and in-depth from a technical perspective, the end product is usually for mundane internal reports that are not important to society at all or even worse, detrimental. The end goal is usually to make some wealthy person even wealthier. Frequently in toxic corporate encironments. Currently I work for a company that performs price optimization services for other companiesüôÑ. It is automated price gouging. A PE firm took over a few tears ago and works everyone to the bone.

Looking back on my career I am not proud of it. Yes I obtained decent $$$ but in the process had to deal with long hours, job instability, egos, politics, and I‚Äôm just done with it all.

I am so tired if this and I have a very difficult time remaining a lay Buddhist in this system we have.

Holy objects make it possible for sentient beings to create the cause to meet the Dharma and actualize the path. -- Lama Zopa Rinpoche,"> As soon as st≈´pas and statues of the Buddha are made, they have the power to cause sentient beings to do actions such as circumambulating, prostrating, offering, and so forth, which then become virtuous actions creating the cause of enlightenment, even if those actions are done with the eight worldly dharmas and nonvirtuous thoughts. These holy objects make it possible for sentient beings to create the cause to meet the Dharma and actualize the path. So even though we who are making these holy objects do not have realizations such as bodhichitta or emptiness, nor have we reached any of the bodhisattva bhumis, the holy objects we make still have the power to liberate sentient beings from the oceans of samsaric suffering, to actualize all the realizations of the path‚Äîguru devotion, the three principles of the path, and the two stages‚Äîand then to achieve enlightenment.

Prayers/Chants for Dying Cat (and Euthanasia),"Hi All,

My cat is dying. She's in very bad shape. We took her to the vet and we were given the option to euthanize. Honestly, she's so bad off I'm not sure I made the right decision to take her home (for now at least). We will update the vet tomorrow and decide if we should euthanize. I'm open to debate on this, because I don't know what to do. I know the standard advice is that it's always wrong. Fair enough...

But Regardless I think her days (likely hours) are numbered. For those of you who believe in transmitting merit I would humbly ask anyone who would like to to pray, chant, or meditate for her benefit. And if you would like to share any chants you like that I could do for my cat I would love those as well.

Thank you. üôè

Help with hurt in a friendship,"I would like some advice about how to proceed in a friendship...

I have known someone for about 2 years, we are coworkers together and are lightly friends outside of that. I would describe it as a ""budding"" friendship... we are quite different, from different walks of life, different coasts, different age demographics... but had a nice emotional connection developing.

About 3 months ago, I bought a house - my first one (!) which meant a lot to me, my parents have not supported me since I was 18 and I have had a chaotic upbringing. It's not particularly nice, about 900 sf and not in a nice area, but owning a house at all means a lot these days and is not an easy thing to accomplish.

Anyway, I told this friend, thinking she would be excited for me, but I was met with silence and that she needed time to process that. Her first response was ""wow"" and not much else. A couple of days later she congratulated me but it felt very forced, and was caveated by being very surprised and uncertain about this development. Given we are from very different parts of the country, I kind of just figured this was normal for her and didn't make too much of it (people are much more 'authentic' here, so slower... don't respond fakely which I appreciate).

Since then things have felt off - one day she asked how I was doing and I mentioned how stressful the homebuying process was, and once again, she kind of became cold and shut down. I just figured it was a weird day. But then again... I mentioned taking a trip out of town the last weekend before the house closed and again... this same response of just coldness.

I brought it up one day a few weeks later and she mentioned that she has felt it very difficult to connect with me since learning I am buying a house, as there are many other things that she would do if she had that kind of money (donate to homelessness causes, indigenous groups, etc) and that owning property was not something she ever wants to be a part of. I felt quite judged, and typecast and misunderstood, honestly, and she told me that she was ""glad I could talk honestly about this type of thing"" (I gave her a background about how I was able to afford buying the house because, for whatever reason, I didn't want her to think my parents had bought it for me or anything). Mind you I am 8 years older than she is so we are in very different phases of life and financial positions.

I am just lost how to move forward. It feels hard to generate compassion for her, because I feel put into some category. Maybe I can get to compassion by seeing that either she is envious, or things that are important to her feel directly threatened (I.e., by owning a house maybe I am disenfranchising local community members who would like to buy a house, or driving up property prices, etc). I think I can understand and have compassion for that, I mean I was in my 20s once and believed so many different things about how the world should work then I do believe now.  But it feels very hard to continue a friendship in the same way. Whatever trust I had about her sense of things feels gone, and I find myself hesitant to share things about myself with her. Maybe the peaceful answer is to realize I know more now and let the friendship go but still think of her fondly as a friend along the path, developing her own sense of things? 

But maybe that is my own insecurity and fear that I need to work past in order to see her differently. I think it's hard not to fall into traps of bemoaning her ""that's so mean"", ""that's so judgmental"", ""oh she's just jealous"" - but all of these feel arrogant on some level and put me above her (when we are all prone to acting like this, I certainly am!) and don't actually ease the discomfort I feel around it.

Question about Mantra Transmission?,"I‚Äôve been exploring mantras and understand that since some are esoteric, you shouldn‚Äôt recite them unless you receive transmission from a teacher. 

I came across this video from the Tibetan Sakya Trichen, giving transmission to viewers to say the Manjushri Mantra. 

Is this legit? Is it as simple as hearing a video of someone saying ‚Äúyou have permission and here‚Äôs how to say this mantra‚Äù? I assume since he heads the Sakya school that it is a legitimate view but I hear so many people claim you can‚Äôt do any mantras without a personal guru that I just want some clarity before I try adding the Manjushri Mantra to my practice.

For context: I am attracted to the mantras benefits for wisdom and I hope that it can help me both understand the dharma more, and help me with studying and exams so I can get to a point in my life career-wise where I can devote more time to practice Buddhism. I heard reciting it helps with both of those goals.",Buddhism,1705000918.0,t3_1949yn5,0.67,2
The Sutra in Forty-two Sections Spoken by the Buddha,"When the World Honored One had attained the Way, he thought, ""To leave desire behind and to gain calm-ness and tranquillity is supreme. "" He abided in deep meditative concentration and subdued every demon and externalist.  
In the Deer Park he turned the Dharma-wheel of the Four Noble Truths and took across Ajnata-kaundinya and the other four disciples, who all realized the fruition of the Way.  
Then the Bhikshus expressed their doubts and asked the Buddha how to resolve them. The World Honored One taught and exhorted them, until one by one they awakened and gained enlightenment. After that, they each put their palms together, respectfully gave their assent, and followed the Buddha instructions.

Skillful Means v False Speech (Christian Edition),"I currently reside in the human realm, in a predominantly Christian country.

Some people in my life, especially older ones, only know and rely on their local brand of Christianity. That wouldn't be so bad if they didn't sporadically torture themselves for their past 'sins'. At the same time they cause more suffering for themselves and others.

Sometimes, these people seem to reach out to me. They are not exactly asking questions, but rather unsolicitedly start talking about sin and salvation. I feel as if they expect some kind of reaction from me, but I usually only resort to nodding and smiling.

Should I share the crumbs of wisdom that I picked up from studying the Buddha Dharma with them? If so, is it skillful to use Christian rhetoric (including concepts and terms that are completely absent or negated in Buddhism)? Or is it false speech (or even slandering the Dharma) to do so?",Buddhism,1704994144.0,t3_19476tw,0.9,8

Seeking guidance and motivation after placing too much importance on a single text,"I sincerely hope my concerns are met with patience, understanding, and compassion. 

As found inside the Anguttara NikƒÅya, in the book of the eights‚Ä¶:
‚ÄúƒÄnanda, if females had not gained the going forth from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One, the spiritual life would have lasted long. The true teaching would have remained for a thousand years. But since they have gained the going forth, now the spiritual life will not last long. The true teaching will remain only five hundred years. 
It‚Äôs like those families with many women and few men. They‚Äôre easy prey for bandits and thieves. In the same way, the spiritual life does not last long in a teaching and training where females gain the going forth. 
It‚Äôs like a field full of rice. Once the disease called ‚Äòwhite bones‚Äô attacks, it doesn‚Äôt last long. In the same way, the spiritual life does not last long in a teaching and training where females gain the going forth. 
It‚Äôs like a field full of sugar cane. Once the disease called ‚Äòred rot‚Äô attacks, it doesn‚Äôt last long. In the same way, the spiritual life does not last long in a teaching and training where females gain the going forth. 
As a man might build a dyke around a large lake as a precaution against the water overflowing, in the same way as a precaution I‚Äôve prescribed the eight principles of respect as not to be transgressed so long as life lasts.‚Äù

The quoted text, is a mere few excerpts from a single sutta inside the Book of the Eights. They are minute and few compared to the whole of the teaching, but after reading them recently‚Ä¶they have consumed my waking and sleeping thoughts, left me discouraged, and affected my emotional wellbeing. I rationally know I am making more of a single text than I should be, but it won‚Äôt get out of my head.

I have read many of the suttas, and keep book on them for where I may find certain passages and lessons. I will admit, too, that I am relatively new and inexperienced in the officially teaching, and lack a locally accessible manner in which to communicate with a spiritual advisor. I have a mind which is afflicted by several various disorders, and it is important to realise that this alone makes it difficult for me to proceed the same manner in which most might find works. Perhaps, too, this fact makes my progress along the path slower.

I am very susceptible to taking the words of someone I revere and relying on them to form the basis of my thought, and any sense of value I could possibly have of myself. I have come out of my worst mental states because of realising many aspects of Buddhism, and I respect the Buddha and the path immensely. 

I know the passage is speaking of the ordainment of a female follower, and not the capability of females to achieve enlightenment as a whole. But, in my mind, I have unfortunately taken any slight suggestion of a female being incapable of pursuing the path to the same extent and manner as a male to heart; as a reason to return to the belief that something is *wrong* with being a female and a follower.

Everything is impermanent, and is constantly changing; what Buddhist could refute that? The societal regard and the way in which it acts is just as susceptible to change, as is the seasons and the perspectives of one's own self. 
I know, the Buddha denied the notion he was superhuman, a figure that nobody else could ever hope to be even close to being like ‚Äî but is he not the Perfected One? He was accomplished in all ways, he had freed himself entirely from the cycle of rebirth. If he of all beings is so reluctant to ordain females‚Ä¶what right would a layperson have to dispute that? Other-where in the canon, it is even stated that as the processes worked for him, if they do not work for us, we must look to where we must improve or change. 

I understand that the passage directly confirms that females, too, can obtain enlightenment ‚Äî and I have read within the canon, too, the proof that the Buddha was not discriminatory or hypocritical as my brain is trying to force me to believe. But this alone doesn‚Äôt ease my mind, and I‚Äôm a little scared at the thought maybe I shouldn‚Äôt pursue enlightenment until I have a life reborn in a male body. It‚Äôs stupid, I know, but please understand it is hard to change this way of thinking. I‚Äôm trying my best, I really am, but sometimes I just need a little support and the minds of others to help me.


I know this perhaps comes-across as a rant ‚Äî but it isn‚Äôt my intention. In a time of trouble, and not knowing where to turn, I have decided to try and be reminded of the truth by those who can say it best. Please be patient with me. I‚Äôve reached out to various online communities before, which should have been places of compassion and kindness, to have my words received with vileness and exasperation. I need whoever chooses to respond to this to keep-in-mind I have a very afflicted way of thinking, and a concerningly low self-regard. I don‚Äôt have anywhere else to turn with this, and I‚Äôm not looking for honeyed words. Please, I just want someone to explain to me why this shouldn‚Äôt change how I feel about the Buddha and the path. I really am relying on gentle words.",Buddhism,1704989260.0,t3_19457uc,0.67,1
Tsog Offerings,"Hi all,

I was thinking today that making Tsog/feast offerings is a great way to create blessings and merit for this life and the next.  Many spiritual texts say that feeding people is one of the most beneficial things you can do.  Many Tibetan Buddhists centers, such as Pema Osel Ling/Vajrayana Foundation, accept online donations for tsog offerings.  I can think of many other Tibetan Buddhist centers in California that receive online donations for tsog.  I am planning to make some donations toward tsog at a center soon.

Also, I've been thinking about a conversation I had with my Tibetan Buddhist teacher (a Tibetan lama).  He once told me when I was very sick, that it would be alright if I come to the center even if I cannot participate in meditation; he said if I just have the energy to enter the center and recite one om mani padme hum, and generate good thoughts, this is very beneficial for myself and others.  I haven't forgotten that, and thankfully I have the opportunity to visit a very nice temple in the next week, where I will be reflecting on this advice.  There is something special about holy places like practice centers, and any practice we do there with good thoughts carry tremendous blessings.

Also, just looking at videos and photos of holy objects like stupas, and generating good thoughts and thoughts of peace and devotion, generates merit and blessings.

Then, of course, there is life release.  Emperor Ashoka, while he was dying, used almost every bit of the treasury money available at the end of his life to ransom animals from slaughter.  As one of the greatest emperors in India's history, Ashoka truly lived what he preached.  He was ardently committed to saving the lives of animals at the end of his life, and he undertook great discipline and hard work to do this.  His ministers had to actually stop him at one point because they were afraid he would spend all of the treasury money.  However, Ashoka didn't do this because he was fanatical; it was out of genuine compassion and a kind heart.

Feel free to share your own practices for how to generate blessings.",Buddhism,1704983457.0,t3_194316u,0.75,2

Caffeine + Nicotine = Breaking the 5th Precept??,"This is something that I imagine is going to get a ton of mixed responses, but I'm still trying to figure out where I stand with this because I feel so torn on this. I'm a new Buddhist practioner (about a year in) and I've recently had a wonderful experience taking the Refuges & Lay Vows before a monk. I have completely quit alcohol and a very awful weed habit, but as someone who still has a coffee every morning and very occasionally I have a cigarette or two every couple of weeks (I'm also planning to quit smoking entirely I'm just weening the cigarettes off at the moment), I can't help but feel I've unknowingly broken the 5th precept and I feel really conflicted about it.

I saw it but now it's gone,"So about two weeks ago, while meditating, I suddenly came to the realisation that there is no self. I suddenly felt how everything is interconnected and that separation is an illusion. It felt a lot like what people describe happens when they take mushrooms, except I was sober and just meditating in my room. For about a week, everything was so clear to me. I could clearly see where suffering comes from, and I felt immense compassion for all living beings. It was because of this insight that I stumbled upon buddhist teaching in the first place. I had never really studied Buddhism before this.   


However, it seems that the fog has come back and obscured my vision again. The realisation/feeling is no longer there. The intellectual understanding is there, but as is often told; this is not something to intellectually grasp, it is something to 'see' or experience. It is like I got a small glimpse of the true nature of things, but normal life has taken over again.   


Has anyone had anything similar to this happen to them? And if so, how did you find your way back to this view of reality? 

(I understand the irony of asking this, since it seems I am looking for a nice feeling for myself, when I just realised there is no self, and this is leading to suffering. However, it is not necessarily the nice feeling I'm looking for. I want to see reality for what it is, and I want to feel that compassion, since I felt extremely motivated to go into the world and help people/animals/nature. The feeling of inner peace is just a byproduct of this view I believe.)",Buddhism,1704965957.0,t3_193xv8l,0.95,17

2 questions,"Hey there :) Just to ask two questions to the folk in this subreddit 

Firstly, I know that name is an illusion, but should I classify myself as a Tibeten Buddhist or a Vajarayana Buddhist. I know that Vajrayana Buddhism is an umbrella term for different schools, including Tibetan Buddhism, but to me, the label ""Vajrayana Buddhist"" and ""Tibetan Buddhist"" have different conotations. ""Vajrayana Buddhist"" seems to infer someone who is actively participating in tantric rituals and whatnot wheras ""Tibetan Buddhist"" doesn't neccessarily seem to entail that, though it can. I know that I should be focused on focused on the teachings but this sort of thing does have an impact because first and foremost, should I go to a Vajrayana temple or Buddhist temple? Furthermore, it's a little hard to respond to ""what's your religion"" or ""which sect are you from"" if one doesn't know how to correctly represent their religion.

Secondly, do I need to attend an official ceromony to be a buddhist? I've already decided that hey, I'm a buddhist and I'm following it's teachings but do I need to officialy, in some actual ceromony, take refuge in the triple gem to be a buddhist? because right now, doing so would be awkward, difficult or even impossible. chance are, i'll have to wait a few more years before i'll be able to officially take refuge.

Can someone explain Buddhahood to me please?,"I‚Äôve heard the term quite often, much like enlightenment but to actually dissect what these stages are like is what I‚Äôm hoping to have a deeper/clearer understanding around. So thanks in advance. 
I was remembering a glimpse of what might have actually been kensh≈ç, as it‚Äôs the most fitting word I found. Since I have come to learn about terms like Satori and most recently came across Stream Entry, which I‚Äôm still learning about. My question is around the term Buddhahood, one is told to it‚Äôs the ultimate attainment so-to-speak, but what actually is it? I know it might be paradoxical to ask or even have it explained, but if there is dissolution of the self, and this sense of merging samadhi if we can borrow that word, typically from what I know the body is in a state of rest or deep meditation, is Buddhahood like that and yet still being here present in the world or?

If there is no self then who gets reborn?,"I know the answer is pragmatically ""nobody"", but my question is really intended to assess the veracity of some deeper appraissals of rebirth I've made:

Because there is no discrete, stable self, yet consciousness evidently exists, then by extension consciousness can be viewed as the universe/Samsara experiencing itself.

Thus upon death, the illusion of self is destructed, and consciousness continues in every life form after ""my"" death. ""We/I"" goes back to the process of space-time expansion which inevitably becomes more consciousnesses, all at once.

Thus, it is not ""me"" that is reborn, but the universe endlessly creating consciousnesses in the cyclical process that I share in common.

Does this align with the Buddhist notion of rebirth? I come from a Western scientific/materialist background so my assessment is prone to error.

Otherwise, rebirth would require some notion of soul, if it is truly ""me"" who is reborn, no?",Buddhism,1704961902.0,t3_193wx4w,0.82,34
‚ÄúThe reason why you do not touch fire is because you know that it will cause you to suffer.‚Äù,"The reason why you do not touch fire is because you know that it will cause you to suffer. Likewise, if you truly understand karma, you will not commit a single negative action, because unless that negative karma is purified, you know that it will eventually ripen into suffering.

You might forget this natural process, or you might not believe in it, because the ripening does not always happen immediately. But your karma will follow you like your shadow, that gets closer and closer without you realising, until you are eventually touched by it. Please, I urge you to always remember this.

\~\~\~

Zen and Buddhist insights, timeless wisdom gathered over centuries, can help guide us in our lives today and in the prudent use of new technologies, nurturing a calm and serene world, prosperous yet existing in harmony with nature, a healthy, contented and good society for the centuries to come.

Let Zen inspire us to sometimes step back from our machines and digital devices, returning to the simple and old-fashioned ways, the slow ways, because they are beautiful ways. In the rush for improvement, let us learn to sit still sometimes and rest from our goals, drop the quest for constant upgrades and efficiency, restrain the endless hunger for progress, and turn off the flashing lights and ceaseless noise.

At the same time, if employed well, technology and medicine can help us bring true peace, an end to most wars and violence committed in anger, cures for diseases, ecological balance, greater love and empathy among people and for all beings, increased charity, remedies for poverty and homelessness, and the attainment of other goals for good in the world as long dreamed of by Buddhists and caring people of many religions and philosophies.

Tomorrow‚Äôs technologies will change Buddhism too. AI and robotics, bio-engineering and physical enhancements, genetics and nano-implants, virtual reality and new media, medical miracles and manufacturing marvels, extended lifespans and expanded minds will make many of Buddhism‚Äôs most fabulous ideals realizable. Zen will be practiced, programmed, bred and wired in; enlightenment will move as chemistry and light across neural fibers and optical fibers.

Could a Buddhist be president of the United States while adhering to Buddhist teachings?,"This is something I've been pondering for awhile.

The President has to make some unenviable choices. For instance, they may have to authorize or even order violent acts in the interest of preserving the lives of innocent people. They may have to choose to cause suffering to a small group to alleviate suffering of a larger group. They may have to actively lie to keep a dangerous secret. 

Do you think it would be possible for someone to serve as president while adhering to Buddhist teachings, or would they at best be ""informed"" by Buddhist teachings while they serve?",Buddhism,1704917001.0,t3_193hluu,0.73,8

feeling alien to my peers,"hello all! i (21m) have been practicing buddhism (mostly theravada) for nearly a year now. i meditate 1hr daily, i try to maintain my mindfulness in everyday life, and i abstain from entertainment (movies, tv, music) in an effort to avoid clouding my mind. im really appreciative of how much equanimity, peace, compassion, concentration, etc the practice has brought me thus far. 

i am having a difficulty though. while i feel the practice has brought me closer to myself and others in some ways, it‚Äôs made me feel more distant to others in some ways. im a college student, and i‚Äôve really realized how much we as people define ourselves in terms of our tastes in entertainment. im finding it very difficult to sustain meaningful conversations with many of my peers because i no longer have such definitive tastes in entertainment mediums, and don‚Äôt use social media (besides reddit). 

i used to be extremely into music, and had such eclectic and varied tastes. it was extremely easy for me to connect with others in regards to musical tastes. now that im not listening to much music, i find it difficult to find topics of conversation to truly connect with strangers on. most people my own age are not meditators and essentially have nothing to say in response when i convey that i practice. while i feel more connected to others than ever, i cant help but feel frustrated when it feels like i can never truly find common ground on a date or while hanging out with new people. if the other person‚Äôs interests venture outside of meditation, the gym, or tech, there‚Äôs usually not much common ground.

i‚Äôve ventured to the meditation and buddhism clubs of my local area to find a tribe, and they‚Äôre mostly either quite small or are mostly populated with older people. this is really isolating me, and im tempted to resume listening to music, or taking in entertainment not even for the pleasure of the medium, but simply to find more ways to relate to my peers. im skeptical because while i know this would give me more conversational topics, it‚Äôd almost certainly interfere with my concentration in meditation. any advice would be appreciated!",Buddhism,1704894342.0,t3_1938mgt,0.72,7

What to do when feeling spiritually lazy,"I‚Äôm 20 years old and have had a number of experiences over the last few years that have led to a tremendous shift in my outlook on life. If you look at my post history I‚Äôm sure you can guess what those experiences were.

But the crux of it is that regularly I feel that I am too lazy in my practice. I have turned towards lord Buddha as a source of wisdom, as his teachings and the generations of those who have come after him resonate deeply with my newfound outlook. However I find myself in what feels like a transitionary stage where I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm going or what I‚Äôm doing here and I can‚Äôt commit myself to any certain lifestyle.

I know that any 20 year old would have these feelings of directionlessness, but in my case I especially have a sense of guilt over it because I don‚Äôt pursue spiritual development, at least not to the degree of the expectations I‚Äôm setting for myself. My mind often treats me like an angry or disappointed parent, and it makes me feel small and helpless.

I don‚Äôt meditate as much as I think I should, and I just generally don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm doing as much as I should be when it comes to the path of ending suffering. I become fearful of the negative consequences my sloth will bring. I think to myself ‚ÄúWhy have I been gifted with such a tremendously lucky life if I‚Äôm only going to shirk my responsibilities?‚Äù 

I try to live my life as mindfully as possible, especially so since coming in contact with the insights and knowledge of Buddhism. I try to be kind to others and myself in all of my interactions and thoughts, and I try to analyze my patterns of behavior to get to the root of why I do the things I do. I don‚Äôt really meditate currently, I think it comes from a fear of not being good enough. But it causes me great stress that in spite of my attempts at goodness, I still might not be doing enough. 

I‚Äôm not certain how to overcome these feelings of fear, guilt and shame. I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm even writing this, thank you for reading it either way.

"What is the relationship between the non-self, karma, and rebirth?","For context, I'm new to practicing buddhism- sorry if this is a question already answered but I've been googling around and it's only giving me more questions. 

So, I understand that rebirth is like a candle, a new life is born from one flame, but is completely new in itself (and that this flame is not a ""soul"" due to the concept of the non-self/anatta). What I struggle with is how exactly rebirth works. Is samsara, or the wheel of life, turned through karmic actions? Say, is the candle's flame the karma generated in one life passed to another, to which the karma will be reformed (as in, released, created, etc.) in that next said life?

This then, leads me to my next question. The Buddha was, assumedly, doing things that would generate karma, however died and was freed from samsara (from what I understand). Is, then, Nirvana the achievement of no longer generating karma through attaining enlightenment? I don't quite understand how this connects to the concept of bodhisattvas. Does an enlightened one choose to allow their karmic energy to continue the cycle of samsara? Where does this karmic energy go if an enlightened one decides to become free of samsara? I feel like we could even take a step forward: if karma drives samsara and therefore the creation of life, nirvana then becomes a nearly godly plane: the choice to truly end the creation of life itself. (side note: It's really interesting how Christianity's goal is to live eternally in heaven in an afterlife when it seems like the goal of Buddhism is to finally die and be free from dukkha and samsara.)

Now I know that's pretty far out there and that's honestly me just pulling on a thread and seeing where I can go with it. If I'm completely wrong, that's fine LOL. I'm very grateful for any responses and answers.

Called out during meditation for where my feet were?,"It took me three years to build the courage to visit the Wat temple near me, based on my own self judgement. I've experienced a lot of loss in the last two years. I am grieving and was looking for quiet comfort in the presence of those who practice compassion. 

An American practitioner, about 15y younger than myself, tapped me on the shoulder, during the meditation, to tell me that I wasn't sitting properly. The practitioner informed me that my legs were not to be pointed toward the Buddha. I feel it would have been better to let me know in private.

 I don't think this person was a representative of the temple, and after the session (?) I overheard them tell another group of ""first-timers"" (this person was standing very close to me, but talking past me to others standing next to me) that it was their 3rd week in town, that they had only been attending for the last two weeks, which made me feel more condescended. 

I don't think I want to return, as I thought the experience would have been more inclusive. I've been through enough judgement in my life, that's why I had such high hopes for this experience.

Is there really a difference between good and bad karma?,"I‚Äôve just been thinking about the fact that the more ‚Äúgood karma‚Äù you have, the more comfortable and ‚Äúgood‚Äù existence becomes in return, right? And then perhaps you‚Äôd have less reason to even want to get free ? 

Or for example if someone attains much good merit then maybe they get reborn into a lot of wealth and power in their next life and then with such wealth and power you often end up becoming corrupt. 

Or how they say that if you get born into a god realm, you likely would end up in a hell realm afterwards. Since you‚Äôve then used up all your good karmas and/or did not work on your liberation at all in that life because why would you? When life if so good with no hardship or suffering barely? 

I almost feel like if you have a decent amount of ‚Äúbad karma‚Äù it would be almost a better life in terms of motivation to become liberated ? Or maybe it‚Äôs almost the best thing to do to have an equal amount good and bad so that you just have an average,  happy life in general but still suffer enough to be a compassionate person with the desire to get free. 

I just found myself thinking about this when dedicating my merits at the end of meditation and asking to attain the good merits but maybe it‚Äôs better to have the bad ones too? It also makes me think about the whole ‚Äúwe want to get free from suffering‚Äù thing. Because I think suffering is so useful. Suffering brings me so much closer to ‚ÄúGod‚Äù. Suffering purifies me, helps me to keep my eye on the prize, and brings me closer to liberation and makes me a more compassionate and understanding person and gives me a better perspective on the world and my spirituality.  

Anyways, hopefully this makes sense. Is there really a difference between good and bad karma when good karma may lead to suffering anyways once it‚Äôs spent and you‚Äôve become corrupt by too much abundance, accumulating ten times the bad karma as you did before? and bad karma would actually be good because it purifies you and leads you onto the path of liberation more swiftly and strongly?",Buddhism,1704838767.0,t3_192rgni,0.5,0

I decided don‚Äôt buy from Islamic shops here in London as well as I don‚Äôt want to contribute to ideology of hatred and oppression.

Is that a right action ?",Buddhism,1704834566.0,t3_192pp7t,0.32,0

Holding 2 opposing believes causing mental discomfort. Hope to cope?,"Hi guys!

I'm currently 21 years old, introverted, single and spend most of my time alone

I've always been interested in spirituality and philosophy, favourite author being Osho

But lately, I regret getting into the whole spirituality scene.

Spirituality and the theme of meditation teaches me to drop my ego and blend in with our natural selves. I, for a fact know that dropping the ego is the best thing to do, to accelerate learning and releasing natural intelligence

But, I'm also into business and investing which requires me to be conscious of money and be tight with certain believes. I can't drop my ego and do whatever, else it's a social suicide

You see my problem here?

One personality wants to be spiritual, intelligent and thinks that's the right thing

Other personality wants to be cunningly intelligent, rational and egoistic

I've been stuck between two of these and I'm so so tired of feeling this way. At this point, I can even call it cognitive dissonance

How do you guys cope with such a feeling?

Any help will be much appreciated!'",Buddhism,1704831160.0,t3_192o9xv,0.78,17

Does Buddhism attract a certain personality type,"Before this thread gets flooded with comments about how there is no self which I‚Äôm well aware of I was just curious to see what kind of people tend to be attracted to Buddhism 

When I tell people I‚Äôm Buddhist after they ask what my religious affiliation is they tend not to be surprised but shocked since i tend to be happy and they equate Buddhism with pessimism‚Ä¶.

all my life people told me growing up that I was a rather sad child‚Ä¶..always quiet and reserved and in my head thinking about the world and things I saw around me

Serious question: can I min/max my karma in this life?,"Hi all, I'm new to buddhism but I'm trying to figure things out. Long story short, is it reasonable to accumulate a little bad karma (i.e. engage in unethical practices) in order to gain enough resources to accumulate a ton of good karma later (i.e. donating lots of money to monasteries and such for karma transfer)? If my overall intent is good, does that excuse a little bit of bad practice? For context, I obviously don't plan on reaching any sort of nirvana in this life.

Weighing Up the Buddhist Path," I have always had an attraction to Buddhism for one reason or another. I am quite relaxed but I live my life upon a set of principles that I use as a foundation for my conduct. The last few years have been quite challenging for me in that I had an illness (since addressed), my old high school friend died suddenly, a myriad of other smaller issues, and just recently my father is recovering from a near-fatal accident. I am not sure if it is because of these issues, or just personal development, but I have recently been exploring Buddhism and I have found a good deal of Buddha‚Äôs teachings align with many of my principles. That said, I am not calling myself a Buddhist yet - I am merely an observer weighing up the path. I am very much at the start of my journey, should it even develop into one, and I have come here to read the thoughts and opinions of Buddhists as part of my ‚Äòweighing up the path‚Äô. I wish to say that so far, this appears to be one of the more friendly subreddits I have come across. *It's perhaps why I feel more confident to post here.*

I am currently reading Approaching the Buddhist Path by His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Thubten Chodron. It is a nicely written and presented book, and I am enjoying it. Although I don‚Äôt quite understand everything being said, the central theme so far appears to orientate around wholesome acts, being a good person in this life, and the level-headedness of controlling one's emotions so as not to inadvertently make bad decisions that harm others or yourself. I am quite aware that these are only scratching the surface of Buddhism and that should I go deeper there are much greater lessons to help progress towards Nirvana and escape Samsara. Another part that interests me is the Middle Way which, if my understanding is correct, centres much around moderation - the grey area. This spoke to me quite strongly in that moderation and knowing that issues in life are seldom black or white is a central tenet to my principles.

So it seems to me Buddhism may provide a great deal to help me become a more wholesome individual in this life so that others may benefit, and better prepare me for the trials and suffering experienced. For a great deal of time, I was an Athiest. And although Science is beautiful and can offer ways of approaching life, it seems to feel somewhat ‚Äòcold‚Äô. To me religion seems to feel rather more ‚Äòwarm‚Äô - if that makes sense. That said, I don‚Äôt really consider myself to be ‚Äòreligious‚Äô per se but I think there is more to life than the pure cold rigidity of Science (as fascinating as it is). I am quite scientifically minded and so I think what attracts me to Buddhism somewhat - although I could be misguided - is that it doesn't seem as standoffish toward science as say what Christianity often appears to be. 

This is also what gives me a quandary about Buddhism. Rebirth being such an important aspect of Buddhism, is deemed impossible by science. So too is the concept of higher realms. Of course, one could reinterpret both of these to fit with scientific evidence; rebirth being metaphorical where one may be ‚Äòreborn‚Äô into a better person during one‚Äôs life, and the higher realms being other universes although transcendence is not possible. These are merely my musings of the uninformed or ignorant self and are very much still in development. 

All this being said. Another aspect described in my studies so far is non-attachment which can provide some interesting thoughts on life. So perhaps to adopt non-attachment towards Buddhism, I am not rushing headlong into it. I am looking at it, keeping an open mind, and looking to absorb what comes from it. As it stands so far, to the question, will I become a Buddhist? I don‚Äôt know, maybe, maybe not. And that‚Äôs before I even consider what sect.

I wonder if what I am doing is right. I do have deeper thoughts on the matter, but I‚Äôll leave them for now and only bring them up should they become relevant to any responses.",Buddhism,1704818663.0,t3_192j2b8,0.84,4
Why does life eat itself?,"I was just contemplating the illusory nature of existence and how we get wrapped up in mistaking the illusion for reality. This led me to begin contemplating the animal brain and how it can quickly derail higher thoughts, making one (myself) slip into full engagement of the ‚Äúdaily grind‚Äù - losing oneself to the illusion until you have time to again meditate. 

Anyway - not sure how I got there -  but this led me to wonder ‚Äúwhy does life eat itself‚Äù in this eternal drama? It seems cruel and grotesque. When you think about it, it is quite a ‚Äúhellish‚Äù image - ripping into and devouring flesh (whether it‚Äôs animal or plant) What is the Buddhist perspective on this?

The Buddhist Noble Truths: Are They True?,"I found this interesting article which analyzes the Four Noble Truths in light of modern neuroscience and psychology, and thought I'd share. Thoughts?

>Scholarship has not so far raised the question whether the so-called Buddhist noble truths are actually true. The present article addresses this question in light of recent developments in neuroscience and psychology. It bases itself primarily on the theory proposed in some publications by Mark Solms, and on some other recent discoveries in psychology. Concentrating on the role of memories in the formation of personality, it draws attention to the potential effects of memory reconsolidation on those memories and shows how cessation of suffering and cessation of desire make sense in this context. Access to the relevant memories presents itself as a little understood process. Proposals are made as to how it may be attained.",Buddhism,1704809040.0,t3_192fff5,0.88,12
Vajra hell is pretty scary,"Vajra hell is pretty scary. It's just how tibetan buddhism calls to me in a way others sects don't but the concept of vajra hell- it's kinda scary man. 

It seems like (though I could be wrong), vajra hell is this kinda secretive thing in vajrayan buddhism- a hell reserved for those who disobey their teacher or break their samaya or something like that. Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche described it as a place of over rationalistic thinking. But it seems really scary. I can accept it if Vajra hell is just a state of mind of overly-rationalistic thinking, trying to scratch that can never seem to be scratched. But how am I to (when I'm older cuz i'm currently a teengager) take a teacher or take empowerments if somehow, this could lead me to some sort of literal hell?

To me, mahayana feels like it lacks some of the things i want and tibetan buddhism calls out to me in a way that can't be helped. But is vajrayana some sort of risky afair, some sort of ""all of nothing"" scenario? ",Buddhism,1704806449.0,t3_192ek70,0.9,79
Meditation,"Sorry if this is a silly question, I don't really have anyone to talk to or ask questions on these things.

I always thought meditation meant an empty mind but I've never been able to clear my head of thoughts which is only made trickier by my mental illness.

What I have found though is stopping all my busy thoughts by focusing on how the things around me are connected and the beauty in being here in the moment because this moment only exists for, well, a moment and it makes me feel blessed to be there. The beautiful birds I hear have made a safe haven in the soothing trees I can hear blowing in the wind. The car going by wouldn't exist without teams of people that worked hard to get it there. The water from the river might become the same water that keeps me hydrated and healthy or perhaps some of it will be the rain nourishing the ground and calming me with it's pitter pattering. 

I feel like it makes me appreciate impermanence if that makes sense because this moment only exists now. One day those birds I hear will die and that's okay, the trees might fall and that's also okay. Maybe the wood will be used for something or perhaps it will nourish the earth with it's rot. It doesn't really matter what becomes of anything I hear. I am just lucky to have been a part of their background as they are to me. I am lucky to have witnessed their existence.

Is this meditation? Is this a decent starting place? Or am I completely wrong and this is just a new grounding tool I've found to help with my mental health?

If it isn't I would love any tips you might have on how to meditate.",Buddhism,1704804028.0,t3_192dtk1,0.67,2

Should I begin practicing Buddhism?,"So, about a year ago I discovered the true power of our mind in shaping our reality. I won't go into the story of how I came to it right now, but I see that a lot of the notions I have come to through suffering relate to the teachings of Buddha. Some of these include how the good life does not lie solely in the material world, mindfulness, how your mentality and actions can reign your state of being, meditation,  every action having a consequence down the line (karma), etc. Recently, I've delved into the Stoics which aligns a lot with those values, but now I see that my values, the Stoics, and the Buddhist are not dissimilar at all.

Lacking the clarity to understand what is skilful speech or action.,"I have been reading Pema Chodron‚Äôs book ‚ÄòWhen things fall apart‚Äô while grieving over the abuse from my ex-partner (41F) who suffers from borderline personality disorder (BPD). This abuse has also started coming from my daughter (10F) as she follows her mother‚Äôs example. To avoid conflict, I have surrendered all attempts at parenting. I am in an ethical dilemma. I strongly believe that my daughter needs a male role model, although my ex devalues me at every opportunity which has now taught my daughter to devalue me and at a later stage perhaps devalue men in general. I have left my daughters life before because I could not endure the humiliation and devaluing of my ex as it was causing fighting that was damaging to my daughter. Since then, my practice has evolved, and I now have the self-awareness and control not to react. I believe my ex thinks that we have a good relationship being unaware or unwilling to accept the damage her abusive behaviours cause. 

I accept that this is karma, that I have played a role and I am coming to the realization of emptiness of self that says to me that the universe in general (my parents, her parents and the environment in which we both grew up) has played a large role in this situation coming to fruition. I have a strong desire to reduce suffering in my daughter, myself and my ex. I practice metta meditation and tonglen regularly. Even though my ex is abusive to other people and me, I do not blame her, I have compassion for her and appreciate she did not choose to be a neglected child. Even when I get to the place where her weapons become flowers or gifts to teach me more about myself, deepen myself awareness and can no longer hurt me. I hold strong concerns for my daughter as she matures as she is young and has no dharma. I cannot rely on the law for justice or protection of my daughter. I believe my problem is that I lack the foresight to be confident on what is the path of least suffering for all concerned. It seems to me that the ethical path, honest communication with my daughter will cause enormous suffering in our lives.",Buddhism,1704801548.0,t3_192d46s,0.76,6
Questions about Buddhism,"I am currently a Christian and do not know much about Buddhism, but I have some Buddhist people in my life, and I am trying to understand some questions I think about often. 

1. I understand that life is suffering, but why? The best answer I can find is Karma for past lives manifesting in one's current life. But why should I have to suffer now for something that I did in a past life? After all, I have no memory of it, and I feel no attachment to any past lives. My brain now in this life chooses my actions now. So why do I have to pay for things that I did in previous lives?

2. If reincarnation is true, how far back does it go? I mean, at some point in history, the first life EVER came into existence, right? And then there were more and more lives. It seems there is no way that every organism alive has past lives that date all the way back to even 1,000 years ago, because, whether human or otherwise, there is simply more life in existence today than there was 1,000 years ago. So then there must be lives that exist now that have had no past lives whatsoever, right? So where do those new lives come from? And how do they experience Karma and things like that?

A Few Death Resources,"Hi everyone, I wrote a post a few days ago about preparing for death.  I appreciated all of the responses and I know that all of us take this work of meeting death seriously, as it one of the most important experiences/challenges we all face.

I hope this is okay, as this is a Buddhist forum, but I wanted to share something I learned recently from attending a death cafe.  This is relevant, because death is essentially around the corner for all of us, and is an important element of buddhist practice and contemplation; and there are a lot of things to prepare that many people don't have the chance to get to (because death can come unexpectedly for many of us).

There are mobile apps (e.g. MyDirectives mobile app, and MYLO) where you can upload your advance directives via your phone and then the hospital can us the app to take in the information on your advance directive.  One of the most common things that happens is people fill out the advance directive and then forget to make a copy and file it with the hospital.  Instead, they let it sit in a file cabinet at home, and potentially the hospitals never has access to it and relatives don't know it's there.  The hospital or doctors office should have a copy on file so they know your wishes.  What I found is many hospitals will only allow you to leave a copy of your Advance Directive on file if you have been a patient there in the past, so this new MyDirectives mobile app and also the MYLO app is a way to get your health care wishes potentially met; which can save a lot of suffering.  (The American Bar Association displays and recommends the MYLO App - which stands for ""Mind Your Loved Ones"".  This app allows you to send information directly to health care providers, whether doctor, hospital, insurance company, family/friends, via email, fax, print, or text.  Information is not stored on the cloud, but locally in the user's tablet or smartphone, and MYLO has no access to a user's profile beyond an email address and registered name.)

Also, I highly recommend the book ""Last Rights: Rescuing the End of Life from the Medical System"", by Stephen Kiernan.  It is full of practical advice for navigating the health care maze and advocating for your dying loved ones, in order to alleviate their suffering.  It is just an awesome book.  I bought it about 5-6 years ago.

Also, there are several hospices around the U.S. with zen gardens and beautiful surroundings, as well as spiritual and other edifying.  Perhaps people who are looking for something a little different than the traditional at home hospice or other hospices may consider researching to find these facilities and planning for this well in advance so this service will be available to you at the time of death.  It can be very encouraging to die in an environment of peace.

Sincere question about intrusive thoughts and feeling guilty about them,"The term probably didnt exist during the time of the Buddha, but we know call them-Intrusive thoughts.

 I often get random thoughts of anger and for no reason feel mad at my wife. I feel horribly guilty while even admitting this online. I don't act on the anger but that nagging feeling is still there.

I have practiced meditation and contemplated over the basic doctrines intensively for around 1 month, and I agree with the fundamental ideas in Buddhism, especially the Three Marks of Existence, Four Noble Truths, Noble Eightfold Path, Anatta, Sunyata, Karma, etc.

However, one thing I cannot understand is why compassion and loving-kindness is the answer. I understand that we are all interconnected as one, bound by the chain of Karma. I understand that compassion and loving-kindness would lead to good karma. In the cases where people hurt us, I understand that they may not have done those things based on their own will because their 5 aggregates are out of their control. They are constrained by their past experiences, genetic and evolutionary traits, survival instinct, and many other external factors. I see understanding as the answer, but I cannot agree on compassion as the answer.

For example, I was used and manipulated in my past relationship in a very harsh way (from my perspective). I can finally get over anger or vengeance for her because I understand that she, just like me, is suffering from a lack of control over her own thoughts and emotions. I can also finally understand that the pain I received from her is a delusion conditioned on the premise that my ego exists and matters. However, I simply refuse to show compassion and loving-kindness to people like this, even after processing all my emotions and identifying the root conditions for the karma cause. While we are all interconnected as one, I would rather result in a net zero by being fully indifferent to them than showing compassion for them. While indifference is one of the Three Poisons, I understand where their hurtful actions may come from. I just simply cannot show compassion.

Why is compassion necessary, on top of understanding?",Buddhism,1704750260.0,t3_191wzs8,0.79,18
a good and a bad person,"i am still trying to unlearn some black and white terms so if i mistake someone go ahead and correct me. 

but there is no such thing as good or a bad person. ill admit it does kind of hurt my ego, because i feel like i am a good enough person to say that i am a good person. plus it makes me feel better. but feeding into the ego is toxic.  

but instead of calling someone you dislike or someone who has abused you a bad person we could use words like ‚Äúunaligned‚Äù and ‚Äúdiscouraged‚Äù ‚Äútoxic/harmful‚Äù or ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù i feel like we need to use more adjectives. 

now the question i have myself asking is ‚Äúwell is my abuser not a bad person if that label doesn‚Äôt exist?‚Äù but i guess i could say to that is: well it not like he isnt or is a bad person hes just a very insecure flawed dangerous being. 

there is no such thing as a good person either. because you can still be the most compassionate and loving person and still be very flawed. no human being is a straight line. 

i know being a good person means different things to different people but it is still a black and white term, i just feel like we as humans should be more in detail and  just stop using the term ‚Äúgood and bad‚Äù when discussing ourselves.

"Just found an old statue of Budai. What is the most respectful way to store it, and do you have any info concerning its iconography ?","Hello and good day to everyone. Please excuse me if there are some mistakes in this post, or if something is unclear, English is my third language.

My mom and I found in our attic a small wooden statue of Budai. It was probably bought ou stolen by one of my ancestors, a colonial officer, during the French Conquest of Indochina. Apparently, according to my late grandfather, the statue has some significant value, but I can't be sure. I joined some pictures of the statue.

As you can see, Budai is standing on a bag, his hands are turning into leaves and fruits. Personally I find it very nice, and  I looked up online a lot of statues in the Vietnamese national collections, but have not seen anything similar, in terms of iconography.

I am not well-versed at all in Buddhism, nor its practices and iconography.  Are the sculptures considered sacred ?  Should they be maintained in a special way? What is the most respectful way to store it?

We are considering getting it examined, along with some other artefacts by an expert. We do not intend to sell it at all, but if it does have some cultural, spiritual or artistic value, we'd like to try and donate it back to its home country.

What is the role of prayer in Buddhism?,"TL;DR: Buddhism has varying views of the supernaturality of the life of the Buddha. I've seen some prayers directed towards Buddha requesting certain things such as peace or calmness.

What view of the Buddha is prerequisite for us to think these prayers have an effect? What is the role of prayer in practice in your view? Does the Buddha exist in a realm beyond able to action these prayers?

Long post:

I'm beginning to get familiarity with Buddhist philosophy and some practices. That being said there's an area of practice I still find a bit confusing which is that of prayer. 

I've seen in a couple Buddhist centres prayers asking things of the Buddha or directed towards him or other Buddhas and supposedly enlightened recent teachers. 

I'm wondering within a Buddhist framework what is the purpose of these prayers? How do they work, is Buddha alive somewhere beyond acting upon them? Are they just for us and framed in that way to help use previous religious practices of the day for Buddhist purposes? 

Although some texts give Buddha very supernatural surroundings to his time on earth others are very plain and non miraculous.

"If there is no 'self', then who is attaining Nirvana?","Everything I have been through is not mine, it's just this entity feeling whatever it sees belong to it. I love someone and they leave me, I feel pain, I fall I feel pain, my loved ones die I feel pain. But when the same thing happen to someone else, I do sympathise but I don't feel the deep pain. This me is a collection of experiences. The people I know might have been with me for sometime so I may have got attached but at the end we are all some flesh, blood and bone. So everyone is the same way, there is no you or me. 

On the other hand if reincarnation is real, then there is a self or a collective self that is all me. It means my 'self' is divided into flames and going on to have different lives. I have been the king and the slave, the evil doer and the victim, the healer and the attacker. And I have been dividing into these 'flames' for eons. And people I know today are myself, making me cry, making me stand and taking care of me.

But then what is the point of reaching Nirvana? It's the place I believe I won't feel attached to self, and accept things as they are not of apathy but of wisdom. Does the 'flame' stops passing if I attain Nirvana? Also, is there any chance that Buddha means the ""flame"" as in off-spring? I find it very hard to wrap my head around reincarnation, which I see is the central tenant of Buddha's teachings.

Can we discuss death?,"Hi everyone,

  I have been thoroughly immersed in studying dying for the last 9 years or so, and have been actively and rigorously training for dying for about 3-4 years.   During this stretch i have been in the hospital several time with extreme pain, illness, and/or discomfort.  The last time I was in the hospital in 2018 I contracted potentially fatal sepsis and was hospitalized for a full 30 days.  30 days in a hospital is not easy.

Of course, this inspired me to be even more determined to find a way to face my own death as peacefully and prepared as possible.  Training for dying has been a very rewarding, challenging, and inspiring journey.

I have learned that the best way for me to prepare is by putting aside one day off every week where I simulate that I going to die that day.  I don't just behave as if I'm going to die, I mentally put myself in the actual position that I am facing having to leave the body that day; which means 1) no distraction of any kind. 2) rigorous spiritual practice and preparation throughout the day. 3) every time I am tempted to pretend like it's a normal day, I don't take the bait and become slack or too relaxed.  4) I set aside 2 to 3 periods of actual death training during that day of death simulation; during these periods I practice meeting the moment of death.  This training is incredibly challenging and rigorous, like being in a crucible (at least for me).  During these periods of death training, I actively practice exactly how I resolve to face the moment of death and I do the specific mindfulness exercises and spiritual practices that I have studied and practiced, and I practice how I will attempt to leave my body (separate my consciousness from my body).  Then i practice exiting the body as I do my mindfulness/spiritual practices.  After a period of this training, I will go to my table and work with clay as a way of processing the emotions that come up, and also as a way of reintegrating/re-acclimating  my mind back into the world, and.gently easing my mind back into normalcy.  Death training/simulation takes an extraordinary amount of effort, resolve, and energy - and I have to do something in between death training sessions to not only put my mind on relaxing and edifying things, but also just wind my mind down from the very demanding training that is involved with preparing to die.

 I've been lucky that I've spent hundreds of hours training one on one with qualified Buddhist teachers over my 14 years of practicing Buddhism, so I've been exposed to a variety of practices and teachings that have helped me to find the right spiritual tools for me; as far as meditation, chanting, breathing, and teachings/principles I follow.   Nearing age 37, after a variety of serious health scares, this is absolutely the best time for me to be doing this - and this work can't wait.  

One of the most important things I've learned is the principle of gradual training, and this has helped me enormously in dying preparation/simulation.  Basically, you can't jump into the deep end if you haven't learned to swim; and even moreso, you won't be able to navigate the water well if you haven't developed your swimming strokes and at least practiced to make them as fundamentally sound/reliable as possible.  So it matters not only that we can swim, but that we learn to swim well also.  In this spirit, I have gradually, incrementally, and consistently increased my efforts and practices for death preparation over the last 3 years, usually about 10-20% more effort than the day before.  I have found that this is the way to make something as difficult as death manageable.  I have found that the best way to accomplish difficult things is to start with manageable, bite size pieces, and gradually increase the level of effort, energy, and discipline.  In this way, I began by doing thorough study of dying and dying preparation, especially with the aid of books like ""Deathing"" by Anya Foos Graber.   Then over a period of months and years, I began to actively practice death simulation and training by applying various mindfulness practices, through a series of trial and error to find what worked under the difficult conditions that death often involves.  I have had the opportunity to apply my practice during \[borderline\] horrific pain and discomfort.  Gradually, my practice has evolved into one that works for me, and undoubtedly it will continue to evolve.  

The most effective practices that are helping me now to train for dying are: 

1) the breathing practices presented by Ajahn Lee in his book ""Keeping the Breath in Mind"" :

Please share anything around dying and dying preparation that you think may benefit others.  This training is so worthwhile, because as we improve our ability to face death, everything in our life and spiritual journey gets easier.

the issue is actually have is having fear of being born in the lower realms. sometimes i do have fears, even for the littlest of things. i try to tell myself if i do end up there it will be okay hopeful i will make it out. im just scared ill give myself religious trauma. 
there this mantra that u say everyday so u can get into pureland. i do believe it could be real but my belief in it isnt as strong. im really not sure if it is real actually i think its cool. but sometimes i do force myself to say that  mantra, makes me feel shitty. like a chore. everytime i say mantras i feel better but this is different. what if i dont get in pure land? 

sometimes i worry about doing buddhism wrong. feeling like i just want to do it the right way. i know there is no wrong or right in buddhism its just a feeling. but i believe this is really because i am from the west. where the religion is like a straight line.

and sometimes i expect myself to practice buddhism in a straight line. i know even monks need more wisdom and they dont know everything but idk.

Any Sutta/Sutra specifying donation percentage?,"I recently learned that in Judaism, the recommended amount for donations are 10% of one's earnings (as long as giving away that amount does not cause the giver to have to rely on charity themselves). Moreover, donation amounts are often multiples of 18 since 18 is the numerical value of *chai*, the Hebrew word for 'life'.

I know that the Diamond Sutra, for instance, specifies *how* we should give, but now I was wondering if there is any Sutta in the Pali Canon or a Mahayana Sutra that specifies a percentage or measure of how much one should give when donating money.",Buddhism,1704658231.0,t3_19115i8,0.67,2
"Why is it considered karmically acceptable to eat meat, but ‚Äúwrong livelihood‚Äù to engage in the sale/trade of it?","I just don‚Äôt really understand the logical explanation for this. Either way you are contributing to the death of an animal by either purchasing and cooking meat or by selling it. From a vegetarian/vegan standpoint for example, buying and consuming meat should be regarded as being just as harmful as the people responsible for industrial farming and the slaughter of animals. To me this makes sense logically. What is the difference? You are still contributing to the profit of these industries so how exactly does this exempt you from bad karma? I‚Äôve even seen people go so far in this sub to say that merely working in a restaurant or a grocery store should be considered generative of ‚Äúbad karma‚Äù or indicative of ‚Äúwrong livelihood,‚Äù and that they would never allow themselves to be in these professions; while those same people will likely eat meat with no qualms because the Buddha did not expressly forbid it. 

It just seems like a kind of holier-than-thou attitude I wouldn‚Äôt normally expect from Buddhism. I suppose this attitude just leaves a bad taste in my mouth and is the primary problem I have always had with religion. Consider for example, many working class jobs that are available to those without higher education are in fact restaurant or grocery store jobs and people without such privileges can‚Äôt afford to be as discriminate in their occupations morality. I suppose you could even say the same for things like the military/trading in intoxicants (sale of alcohol/drug trade) which primarily focuses its recruitment on lower class/younger people. Does karma take things like this into context? Does the situation of your life change how your karma affects you? If not, how can people justify a belief in something that chooses to ignore context and circumstances, as well as the cause and effect of their actions. Why does immediate experience trump all in regards to karma if its is supposed to be a result of your behavior, words, thoughts and actions?",Buddhism,1704656379.0,t3_1910esd,0.88,101
"Buddhist ""self help"" is good but preliminary","Particularly in the west, where Buddhism is not the default but has to be actively sought out, it seems common for those interested in Buddhism to be seeking relief from various life challenges.  This makes perfect sense; Buddhism's central purpose is to allow relief from suffering.  But it appears that many westerners (myself included) are at least initially drawn to Buddhism not to pursue Buddhism's ultimate soteriological goal in earnest, but to have a better samsaric experience. Thus, we focus on things like how to let go of self-judgmental thoughts, how to be less angry or less anxious, or how to be kinder or to love more fully. Stuff like that.

These things are all important. Teachers like Thich Nhat Hanh have devoted thousands of hours of Dharma talks and thousands of pages of Dharma books on these exact subjects. I would never discourage any westerner interested in Buddhism from pursuing those sources. They are critical for laying the groundwork -- for facilitating the conditions under which deeper teachings may be successfully learned. Just, please keep in mind that Buddhist practice is intended to go far beyond these things.  Do not let yourself fall into the trap of being satisfied with a slightly better samsaric experience.  As Thich Nhat Hanh, himself, has explained:

>When we come to the practice we see a couple of Dharma doors that help us to feel relaxed and well. We like these practices very much and we master them in our daily life. Most of us are satisfied just to know how to breathe, survive, and smile, but we are not interested in going into the depths of Buddhism . . . to discover its most precious treasures. This cream of the Dharma is our true inheritance; with it, we can attain fearlessness, nirvƒÅ·πáa, and insight capable of snapping all of the ropes that bind us. That is the greatest aspiration of a practitioner. To be caught in our monastery, in our organization, in our particular group of friends‚Äîthe shared joys, sadness, and dreams‚Äîis a real waste.

>Therefore, to learn to transform our anger so that we can survive, smile, say a few kind words to another person, and be just a little less angry is good, but it is not our deepest aspiration. Our deepest aspiration is complete freedom. Therefore, we have to devote our lives to the practice with true determination. That is the heroic resolve we need to commit to in order to realize freedom.

Thich Nhat Hanh, *Cracking the Walnut: Understanding the Dialectics of Nagarjuna*, pp. 75-76.

If you are enjoying Thich Nhat Hanhs works about anger, fear, or love, or any of his many titles on these sorts of subjects -- or any similar works by other authors -- please consider progressing to deeper teachings when the time is right for you. Please consider adopting a formal practice as soon as you feel ready. Personally, I spent years ""messing around"" with Buddhist themed self-help before I decided to pursue deeper teachings, and I wish I had done so sooner. It is so much more effective to approach suffering from the root, and to seek to actually cure it, rather than wrestle with the largely symptomatic treatment of more generally applicable topics.  At least, this has been my experience.",Buddhism,1704656066.0,t3_1910afg,0.97,63
Forgetting my thoughts as I focus on the breath,"Edit: I suppose the title should be: is it ok to deliberately keep track of my thoughts in meditation?

I do a basic meditation where I use body sensation as the object of meditation. I observe the sensations, usually in my torso, and the likely emotions that describe those sensations well. Thoughts, of course, are bubbling up all the time, sometimes sometimes I‚Äôm drawn to following a train of thought and do so, but as soon as I notice, I just note that I am thinking, and come back to my body. 

In tandem, I‚Äôm also doing some trauma therapy. Some aspects of this therapy benefits from self analysis, so nowadays when I meditate, I pause every few minutes, deliberately, and mentally catalog the sensations I was feeling and the types of thoughts that come up. When I‚Äôm confident I‚Äôll remember, I return to the meditation instructions.

Sometimes, I‚Äôm unconsciously drawn to also analyzing the relationship between the emotions and the thoughts while I‚Äôm in the meditation period, but I know this is ‚Äúbad‚Äù as I‚Äôm probably doing it to escape some uncomfortable feelings, since I‚Äôm doing it without intent. It‚Äôs more of a manifestation of monkey mind than conscious choice. So when I catch these types of thoughts I return to meditation.

After the meditation period, I try to analyze the patterns I observed, to find some insight or bring them into therapy to discuss with my therapist. it‚Äôs been a very helpful practice so far - for example, it helped me realize that my subconscious mind will spawn up infinite ways I could help people in my life, in response to me feeling discomfort about some interpersonal relationship. It‚Äôs got something to do with abandonment issues and people pleasing. 

My question is: from a Buddhist standpoint, is there anything unconventional or ‚Äúwrong‚Äù about having
1. A deliberate cataloging period in the meditation and 
2. Analyzing patterns post meditation to understand my conditioning better? The purpose of understanding my conditioning better is to make it easier for me to recognize when I‚Äôm being run by it in the future. There may be some other motivations too, but if there are, I either can‚Äôt verbalize them clearly or they‚Äôre subconscious.

It's been a while since my last post on this, but here is a continuation of my immersion in the Dhammapada.

***Intention shapes experiences***

Peering deeply into this verse, I found that happiness isn't the only thing that follows you like a shadow:

***What goes with you,***  
***like a shadow that never leaves?***

***Both the good and the bad***  
***that a mortal does in this life***  
***is what they can call their own.***  
***That‚Äôs what they take when they go.***  
***That‚Äôs what goes with them,***

&#x200B;

Karma.  
Karma is your shadow, and it can be a shadow of happiness...or not.  
In the [B√∂n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bon) tradition, as well as certain schools of Tibetan Buddhism, the negative aspects of one's mind are faced head-on, so as to confront them and ""cut through"".  

Carl Jung also used what has been called ""shadow work"" to incorporate these negative aspects of the self.

&#x200B;

*‚ÄúOne does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious. The latter procedure, however, is disagreeable and therefore not popular.‚Äù* 

\- Carl Jung

&#x200B;

I believe this cuts right to the heart of the matter.  Do we ignore and attempt to purge ourselves of the evil aspects of our shadow, or do we face them and assimilate it?

Whether it‚Äôs people or events or things that remind me of things, I have found in the past 5 years at least since I‚Äôve cleaned up that I cannot for the life of me know and understand what it looks like to let go of things. I will tell people I forgive, and I like to trick myself into thinking the passage of time and forgetting is the same as forgiving and letting go. But it always reappears in trauma and the way I behave and treat those I say I love and I get really sad and hard on myself. I meditate daily and pray in the mind of gratitude but I struggle with the application a lot. I sometimes feel cursed or that karma is simply behaving as it should. I have not lived that good a life up until 2018. How do you let go and forgive and show those who harmed and wronged you love and humility? How do you forgive and live with less anxiety and fear?

"Advice for a ""beginner"" is needed. What do you do when there are some days when the teachings you have interiorised just won't do?","Hello, first post on here. I've been learning about Buddhism for two years now, integrating it into my life as much as possible. I've become a calmer person, I don't have as many wants as before, I don't have as much anxiety, I feel better overall. The teachings of Buddhism have helped me to live my life without suffering as much as I did before and I can only desire to carry on on my path and to get better.

However, there are some days when I wake up and I feel like nothing I've learnt works. This morning I've woken up with an anxiety attack and I haven't been able to eat at all during the day. I woke up hating my life (below the poverty line, my boyfriend is depressed, I live on the ground floor so I never get sunlight inside, hate my job and hate my city) and I wanted to just cry. 

I cried for a bit and then sat down and did some breathing exercises and went to the park to medidate. I am calmer now and trying to be compassionate with myself, thinking that I will bear it all better tomorrow, but I hate when it all crumbles.

Opinions on this?,"Hi my friends :)

I'm a teenager from Singapore and I haven't exactly fully decided which Buddhist sect to follow, though I am definitely leaning towards Tibetan Buddhism aka Vajrayana. It's just that something that perhaps transcends logic just feels right. Yk how they say how you don't choose your sect, it chooses you.

Anyhow, I'm thinking, the way the lotus sultra isn't really emphasised or included in the Tibetan canon, what are your opinions on say a tibetan buddhist reading the lotus sultra and somehow, somewhat finding wisdom in it and using it to advance further down the path.

Just thinking about the concept of reading sultras and on an individual level, deciding which one's to incoporate or emphasise in one's practice. Because I don't know, maybe a sultra isn't included in the canon of one's sect but if it helps one's buddhist practice, is it dharma? Perhaps the teaching isn't exactly those of Gautama Buddha himself but some monk or lama who was inspired by his teachings and produced a fine work that can help one down the path? I don't know.

&#x200B;

Also if a sultra isn't included in the canon of one's sect, say the tibetan canon, does that automatically make it invalid or false-dharma?

"Faith, Practice, and Vows in Pure Land Buddhism",">You should know that the teaching of the Pure Land relies on the unfathomable strength of AmitƒÅbha Buddha's forty eight kind and compassionate vows, which embrace and accept all sentient beings in the ten directions.   
>  
>As long as beings possess a mind of faith, they will all be reborn there. Faith refers to faith in the existence of the Western Pure Land; faith that AmitƒÅbha Buddha embraces and accepts sentient beings. We sentient beings believe that we have the potential to be reborn in the Pure Land, and although it is said that AmitƒÅbha accepts sentient beings in rebirth, we must believe that this only manifests according to our minds as a response to our invocation and ultimately cannot be obtained externally. If one has faith in this, then one possesses true faith.   
>  
>However, faith without practice cannot be called true faith. Regarding practice, the *≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama S≈´tra* states, ""Restrain the Six Sense Organs and have pure thoughts without interruption. Without the use of expedient means, one's mind awakens on its own."" The *AmitƒÅbha S≈´tra* states, ""If there are virtuous men or virtuous women who hear others speak of AmitƒÅbha Buddha and hold fast to his name for one day, two days... up to seven days single-mindedly without distraction, then at the end of their lives, AmitƒÅbha Buddha and his sacred assembly will appear before them, and so, at the end of their lives, their minds will not have inverted views, and they will swiftly attain rebirth in AmitƒÅbha Buddha‚Äôs Land of Ultimate Bliss."" This kind of practice is called proper practice.   
>  
>However, without vows, practice will never be fully accomplished. Regarding vows, one must resonate with each and every one of AmitƒÅbha Buddha's forty eight vows, for these are the greatest vows. Faith, practice, and vows are like the three legs of a tripod; not one can be missing. Now, you should know that the very thought you have right now is inherently perfect and eternal. Faith, practice, and vows are the nature and virtue you originally possessed all along. Now, this is merely your inherent nature manifesting its radiance.

How to practice Samata and vippasana meditation?,"Hi,
I am kind of confused with the two types of meditation, Samata and Vippasana.
With Samata meditation, you focus on your breathing (objects) and try to keep your awareness there. When you notice that you are not on the breathing you kindly come back to your breaths.
With Vippasana meditation, you observe your mind  and see them clearly. When a thought come, let it come and go and you can just observe that.
Do you practice both of them in the same one meditation session? Or can you practice them separately?

From a lot of guided meditations I listened to, I noticed you practice Samata first and then Vippasana. But when your mind gets calmer, guidance let you go back to Samata.

Do I understand Buddhism?,"So I'm new to Buddhism, having been interested for many years but only recently started doing serious research. I've been reading and rereading about the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path, and I *think* I have an understanding of what's being said and how it applies to me personally, but I'd like some feedback.

So I'm a writer, have been all my life. I've written a number of original short stories and fanfiction, and my dream is to publish a novel someday. I love writing stories and putting them out in the world for others to read and enjoy. I particularly enjoy getting comments because I love hearing what people think of my writing. But sometimes that works against me: if I get little to no comments on a story it leaves me feeling discouraged and like the effort I put into writing didn't amount to anything.

So looking at this from a Buddhist perspective... I'm inviting suffering onto myself because I'm putting to much of my happiness on external forces, in this case being feedback from readers? And the way to avoid suffering is to stop putting so much emphasis on feeding my own ego and seeking validation from others?

How does love work in to the Buddhist idea of peace?,"I have recently started to read more about Buddhism, but I am very early on in my journey and have a lot of questions and few answers!

Due to why I started seeking out new sources of wisdom, I've found myself reading a lot on meditating on your own death. I don't think I'm ready for it right now, as I think I need to be more calm first, but one part of that meditation that I have a hard time grasping/understanding/coming to terms with is the idea that my death anxiety comes from my worldly attachments, including my relationships. I have never had much draw towards material wealth, but I have a partner I love very much and who makes my life feel complete. If I want to accept my death, do I truly have to relinquish my relationships so I don't feel sorrow upon not having them when I die?

Question about anatta and the 5 aggregates (+ clearing up misconceptions),"Yo Buddhists, I've got a question about a debate point between Hindu and Buddhist philosophy.

So basically, Buddhist teachings talk about there being no permanent, fixed self, which is the doctrine of *anattƒÅ*. At the same time, they describe our experience as being made up of five different aggregates, which is the *skandhas*.

But the Hindu Nyaya school had a *critique* here. Essentially ""If there's no eternal self, then what's actually combining and organizing these skandhas into a coherent experience? Shouldn't something be doing the bundling?"" *or more formally* ""The skandhas (form, feeling, perception, mental formations, consciousness) are described as the categories/aggregates that make up our experience of reality. However, for the skandhas to function as such (i.e. to be synthesized into a coherent experience), then wouldn't something need to perform that synthesis?""

I couldn't seem to find a direct response or rebuttal from any buddhist addressing this particularly. So can any of you Buddhist scholars help explain how y'all reconcile the skandhas with the lack of self? The best I can think of is that the nyaya simply assumes that there needs to be a self to do the bundling/synthesizing, or rather even if there were a self, that the self is permanent. Clearly, buddhists assert that the skandhas don't require a self after all. Looking forward to hearing your takes on this classic philosophical debate point.

For context; this was one of the papers I was reading - [https://core.ac.uk/download/7433921.pdf](https://core.ac.uk/download/7433921.pdf)

*Sidenote: I've been on a binge re-learning about buddhist ideas, and clearing up misconceptions. So far I've learned about upadanda, and the difference between tanhƒÅ and chanda attachments/desires. How sunyata doesn't necessarily mean that things doesn't exist per se, but rather it lacks actual substance/essence.*

Tired of life when things aren't working out,"



Some say just be positive or just take action then see what happens. If nothing happens just accept it and move on with life. It's like I try to do the right thing and try to fight for my justice and I'm here chasing there and here but I get no sort of help. I put trust and faith and try to be optimistic but nothing without at the end. I feel emotionally mentally exhausted like why do bad things keep happening in life and why do I always feel like every door I try to knock on just closes and closes. I don't know when things will work out and it's emotional wreck because you can't even feel enjoyment or any presence in current life when you are dealing with so many problems. You eat,sleep,work but your heart isn't there. Your mind is always in overthinking worrying mode.

Reality itself as an incomplete or distorted or to be more precise - an immaterial idea,"Long text wall ahead, please do read and share your comments. Have tried my best to express some jumbled thoughts. 

The way Buddhism approaches reality, the truth that one realizes eventually by following Dharma, let's assume this understanding itself is flawed, and one of the reasons being one's own subjective delusions. I mean it in the sense that there's no to verify until the wisdom dawns. The Buddhadharma path in general seems to suggest that by treading in the path one can achieve what was already evident to everyone; garbha.

I remember in Vasubandhu's works as to how he mentions that we cannot fathom what runs in the minds of the Buddhas and draws a clear distinction from our minds to make sense of why at a subjective level our minds are clouded. This is sensible, but the question that interests me is while following the path, it definitely feels like a certain leap of faith and blind acceptance is needed on the part of the seeker in considering the possibility of Buddha minds through deities of various forms that are nourishing us throughout this journey. And it's possible we may not even be receptive to these energies for most of our lives.

With this as background, isn't it better to rather refrain from this belief and only restrict oneself to what our understanding of reality is at that moment, and accept that reality itself is in some sense irrelevant? My surface level understanding of this idea feels like this avoids the Buddhist extremes, and so by not pursuing Buddhahood, the seeker is in a better position in the journey because he has less delusions to let go of eventually by not believing, and so whether a Buddha mind exists at all, actually free from ignorance - that notion itself is irrelevant.

The more one thinks in a positive manner and works by strictly adhering to practices, the more there is to let go, which might get difficult later on. Nagarjuna elaborates on this specific aspect in MMK if I recall accurately. In context to the two-truths, if I'm basing reality honestly and solely based on my subjective, relative experience, I am then mirroring an absolute that is actually full of defilements. This vision seems more beneficial because there is no additional burden on the seeker to further acknowledge realities that one can neither agree nor disagree with. Including the very wisdom one seeks.

Connecting back to the title - they are immaterial. So by not focusing on them, which are in a sense positive steps in Dharma, I'm avoiding the traps that may arise from them and so letting go of what I already know and have been gifted with in this life itself is already a big task, so this negative approach should suffice to realize that it is only through ignorance we are imagining either existence or non-existence and so there is literally nothing to fear or achieve or search besides what we are already witnessing - a fractured, broken perceived reality. What else could a Buddha know and do besides this? Nothing.

Thoughts on whether this falls on the two extremes or any insights at all would be much appreciated. I do not mean any disrespect to the Dharmas so if anything in this post comes across as so, forgive the missteps, they are mostly due to errors of expression.

Breathing practices,"Hi all,

I have been deeply reflecting on how to best prepare for handling adversity such as serious illness, severe pain, and death.  I went to Thanissaro Bhikkhu's teachings for resources and found the story of his teacher's teacher Ajahn Lee, who successfully recovered from a heart attack by experimenting with the breath/prana - through trial and error.  He had watched holy men in India who could lay on beds of nails - and through insight he realized it was because they had mastered their breath.  He explains that mastering the breath is way more than just bringing awareness to the breath and following the in and out breath like in Shamata meditation.  It really has to do with qi/prana, as much as it has to do with breath.  If we find ourselves in times of severe pain or illness, we can potentially do this technique as a way to withstand adversity - this is one of the main objectives Ajahn Lee lays out.  Here is Ajahn Lee's book ""Keeping the Breath in Mind"" where he explains the techniques that worked for him: [https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/thai/lee/inmind.html](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/thai/lee/inmind.html)

Also, here is a talk by Thanissaro Bhikkhu where he discusses what he learned from Ajahn Lee's life and teachings: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czrSsT9wclc&t=9s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czrSsT9wclc&t=9s)

While learning about this method, I saw a post from a friend of mine on a private Buddhist discord channel where he showed a video about learning ki breathing, which is from Aikido.   I discovered that this is a great breathing technique for me to build my lower dan tian reservoir of qi, improve my health, and also to deepen my concentration and relaxation.  No method is right for everyone, but I have found this works well for me; I have been practicing ki breathing for approx 4 days.  I find it to be really helpful for strengthen my chi, calming my breath, and just leading to an overall feeling of well being.  One of the primary teachers of ki breathing, Kochi Tohei, writes: ""If on the occasion of some great incident you are agitated and unable to get a single good idea, resolutely practice ki breathing for about two hours, and you will be able to make up your mind, as new courage surges through you.""

Here is a youtube video that shows how to do the method:

Opinion on Telling People to Find Teachers and Sangha,"First things first, if you have found a trustworthy teacher and/or a welcoming sangha, I rejoice for you! This post is not about how helpful having a teacher or sangha is. If you are not one of the people who urge others to find a teacher or sangha, you can safely ignore it.

Even with wholesome intentions, urging people to find a teacher or sangha, especially if they simply come here to ask questions, can build up a lot of pressure. I even witnessed a comment being downvoted simply because the person said that they currently had no teacher.

**Here's the issue**: depending on where you live, you either don't have a sangha that you can physically visit or the local 'sanghas' are run by exploitative groups that only use the label Buddhism as a deceptive front.  Sure, there are online sanghas, but there are also time zones, work days, responsibilities. Let alone sickness, disabilities, anxiety, trauma.

Usually, you don't know anything about the persons coming here, so please keep in mind that finding a teacher or sangha could be extremely difficult for them. Moreover, if you - after taking this into account - proceed to recommend that they find a sangha, **please** include links to the various lists of dangerous or exploitative cults, so that people know which groups to avoid. I will also look for some of them and post them as comment or edit.

Thank you for reading this and a big thank you to everyone who will try to be more mindful about this topic in the future.

Struggling to find a sangha that welcomes all ages.,"Is it normal for small sanghas to be primarily adults or older adults that don't allow kids attending?

The problem is that it's far away and the weekend meditation class is fine for adults, but not ideal for kids on a school night. Sadly the local sangha I was attending was not keen on kids because of dharma sharing and the sometimes adult topics that come up. I totally understand their hesitancy and was offered the kids to join meditation and to quietly leave before dharma sharing. I appreciate their willingness greatly. Meditation would be great for them, but I was also hoping for the kids to learn the dharma as well, or at least have the option if they wanted to experience a full sangha session.

How can intention exist if anatta is true?,"In the Pali canon, the Buddha very clearly says an individual owns their own karma and that an individual should skillfully use intentions and ethical behavior to free themselves from all pain and stress.

I understand that the Buddha spoke using conventional language, but how can intention exist alongside anatta? If all we are is conditioned phenomena, processes like a verb rather than a noun, then how is it the conditioned phenemona can exert control over itself via intention?

Even granting that anatta has to be understood via practice and not semantic abstraction... I sometimes worry Buddhism isn't very logically sound on this ground. A lot of people struggle with anatta and rebirth, but the idea of a conditioned process or karmic stream transforming doesn't seem absurd to me. There not being an intender behind the intentions at the heart of the Buddhist practice, however, seems somewhat absurd.

I am very, very close to being a Buddhist if not for questions like this one, so please take my post with that intention (see what I did there?).

Does Buddhism make you a calmer person?,"Oh dear, that's a terrible post title. Let me explain.

I'm looking into secular Buddhism. I don't yet know any other specifics. I understand that ""Buddhism"" is a catch-all term for a variety of practices.

I'm interested for many reasons, such as working diligently to cultivate a compassionate mindset. I expect to delve deeply into study, to be committed, and to try to live authentically. I don't expect this to be easy. I expect it to be a lifelong practice. I'd never stop learning and working on myself.

I'm wondering if it might make me less anxiety-ridden.

My PTSD controls my life. I'm constantly on edge. I can't escape my online trolls/abusers. They follow me from platform to platform. I can't control their bad behavior. All I can do is try to keep my anxiety, anger, and urges for retribution under control.

I don't see Buddhism as a fluffy feel-good escapist panacea. Quite the opposite.

I'm not expecting it to solve my problems. I'm not expecting it to heal my PTSD. All I'm hoping for is the ability to cope with my anxiety and my anger more effectively by cultivating a calmer way of thinking. (Mindfulness meditation isn't helpful. I have tried many, many different things.)

Would you say that your Buddhist practice has made you calmer, more peaceful? Is there anything else you'd like to add?

Advice regarding partner's mental health,"My gf is pregnant with our first kid. She's struggling with her mental health. She hears voices, sees shadows that aren't there. After she became pregnant, she decided to skip most of her medication. So that it doesn't affect the baby. This abrupt change took a toll on her physical health and sleep rhythms.
She will go to the clinic in a few days. This was adviced by the psychiatrist a few days ago.

I am worried about the kid's future. We've known each other over a year. She's been in the clinic for 5 months. And I've been spending time alone while she's absent most of the time. She smokes a lot of cigarettes due to the stress caused by changes taking place within her body. I have come this far due to compassion for her. But I have needs too and I'm worried about my kid's well being due to her smoking habits. I'm worried that her visits will continue even after the kid is born and I'll be alone with the kid.

"I get some intrusive thoughts, which buddhism had made a little worse","From time to time I get terrible thoughts. To you they will sound extremely silly but my mind gives me this feeling that they are real. Such thoughts range from me being locked up in a coffin or going blind. Now, in the last one year or two, I've been interested in buddhism. Reading about the extremely long durations of hell in Buddhism and how easy it is to get into these, I feel nothing but a saddening feeling, especially towards my parents. Sometimes it gives me thoughts about failure to enter the stream and remaining stuck in the cycle. Now, moving forward from the topic of these obsessive thoughts, the concept of impermanence and thinking about it has also caused me to have some sort of empty feeling towards many things and everything enjoyable feels slightly empty because there is always an underlying feeling about it being impermanent.

What do you think about the Madhyamika teachings of Buddhism?,"Hey folks,

&#x200B;

So for a while, I have been studying the Buddhist Madhyamika teachings (the Buddha, Nagarjuna, etc...), which is that of emptiness and dependent origination, and I find them to be quite incredible. To me, they are one of the best spiritual teachings out there. Seeing everything as empty, helps to decrease identification with, attachment to, as well as desire and grasping for, this world of form, names and dualities, namely the body-mind, which consists of the Five Aggregates. This, in turn, helps bring peace and happiness, and may eventually lead to the ""attainment"" of nirvana. What do you guys think of the Madhyamika teachings of Buddhism? Thanks.

Beginner here: I‚Äôm feeling conflicted about choosing between Theravada and Mahayana,"Hello all! I‚Äôve recently been getting into Buddhism and have been trying to study some of it each day. Today I was struggling with differentiating the multiple schools of Buddhism but ultimately think I understand the key differences between the traditions. If my understanding is correct in the simplest way I can think to explain it Theravada is the path of reaching enlightenment in this life and stopping rebirth and Mahayana is taking the path to enlighten all beings before ultimately reaching your own nirvana. In my head now *somewhat* understanding the two main schools I feel more aligned with Theravada but apart of me feels bad for picking it over Mahayana. I feel like it would be selfish of me to chose to focus on my enlightenment rather than caring about the rest of the worlds enlightenment as well. I really want to pick a school to follow so I can start implementing practices into my day to day life and also want to know before I start looking for teachers in my area.

Lie to help another person?,"So this may be a very dumb question from a beginner, sorry in advance.

Recently I came upon the situation that a friend of mine went to rehab because of his alcoholism.
After his release date being announced his GF wanted to buy some stuff and since she had no way of transport I went shopping instead and she sent me a list.

The list contained normal stuff, food, etc but also a specific alcoholic drink, which I know she literally never drinks because she doesn't like the taste. After asking her why it's on the list she answered it's only for her but as I said, she never drinks it.

Because of my suspicions I lied after shopping and told her the store was out of the specific drink. My thinking is she wanted to do something good to her BF and buy it because he likes it and she wants to make him happy, however I don't think it would be a good decision because he's a recovering alcoholic. Mind you, she's also alcoholic so I think here judgement is kind of biased.

Was I in the right to lie here and tell her the store was out of the drink she put on the list? It wasn't, but if I had bought it I'd feel really bad about it, knowing my friend would probably start drinking it again. The end of the story is, she went herself a day later and bought it anyway, but I just couldn't do it because I know it would hurt him again in the long run as a recovering alcoholic.

I know I shouldn't lie, but what if it's helping another person? My intention is good I guess, but I still lied which is bad. Did I put my own desires above theirs? I'm kind of feeling bad for lying but buying it would make me feel even worse.

My question can probably be extended in general, is it ok to do a bad thing now if the result is something good in the long run? How would my karma be affected if I genuinely try to help and do something bad like lying so the end result will be good?",Buddhism,1704450405.0,t3_18z3s9c,0.92,9

Am I a Buddhist or Atheist?,"Hey friends, strange question here. Recently someone asked me if I were religious and honestly I was completely overwhelmed with that question. So what do you think?

I was raised without religion and when I was younger, always wondered how people were able to believe in 'this nonsense'. I thought i knew it better than them (ignorance back then, I had no idea at all).

Then life happened and after some events in my 20s I became really interested in buddhism. I even went abroad to a monastic institute to volunteer there for quite some time.

Since a few years (now in my 30's), I took buddhsim a bit more serious. I do vipassana retreats, have committed to the triple gem and do my best to align with the five precepts and the noble eightfold path and I have to say it all feels great. I read a lot and I think overall, the buddhist mindset really adds wholesomeness to my life.

**However, the thing is this**:  I think of all the teachings solely as a guide to live life currently. I think karma (/kamma) is real,  and I can accept it based on the explanations by e.g. Alan Peto (who refers to Tich Nhat Hanh). Reincarnation, *not* rebirth based on previous actions.

I just cannot believe in anything supernatural, nothing beyond matter, our brain and this current life. 

* Conciousness? Just physics, chemistry, electricity. 
* A soul?  Nope, maybe some quantum physics happening in our brain.
* Existence before birth or after death? Not a thing imho.
* Gautama Buddha? Probably a really wise but normal human. I dont know.
* Enlightenment? Mostly officially reserved for monastics, a long-term goal. Maybe a bit overhyped.

So can I call myself a buddhist? I think buddhism certainly *is* a religion and without belief, I am not sure if I can really be a part of it. And I do believe, just that I belief in it as a guilde for a good life and not as a way to achieve enlightenment and become an Arhat or higher being afterwards. No cycle of rebirth, samsara, no past or future life, and no karma accumulation beyond this current existence. Yet I feel that this path is for me anyways.

I would not necessarily call myself an atheist either since I do follow buddhist teachings. But not as people that are not into the topic understand. So to those, I would for simplicity say that I am not religious, even though thats not actually really the case...

**TLDR**: I cannot belief in anything but this current existence. No supernatural beings, no soul, no existence after death. Yet I think the teachings are highly valuable. Can I still be a buddhist?

Difference between an Arhat and a Buddha,"(Quick background to put my viewpoint into context: raised skeptical agnostic in the west. Skeptical of most things by nature. Had my ¬º life existential crisis about the ""point of it all"" and am trying to lean more into spirituality and Theravada Buddhism has sparked the most interest. Got a lot to learn but have a somewhat decent comprehension of the core doctrine (4 nbl truths, nbl 8 fold path, anatta, dependent origination, kamma, rebirth etc))

Recently I've been listening to a series of talks by Bikkhu Bodhi introducing Buddhism which he states the functional difference between a Buddha and an Arhat is that a Buddha rediscovers the Dharma after it has been forgotten and attains enlightenment out of their own effort, while an Arhat follows the Dharma taught by the Buddha of their Kalpa and attains enlightenment through the following of the teachings. Both are enlightened, the distinction is based on how they got there.

This sparked my curiosity and did a bit of searching to see if there are any Arhats alive today. This lead me down a chain to find an argument made that an Arhat cannot recognise the Arhatship of another (i.e both are enlightened and will try to teach one another as they cannot see that either one has already realised Nibbana).

But a Buddha can see if a being is enlightened. 

To me this doesnt add up and seems like a logical fallacy. If the distinction between a Buddha and an Arhat is based on if they discovered the Dharma or not then there wouldn't be a difference between their abilities to recognise other enlightened beings...right?

I appreciate I'm likely missing something here, or have made some assumptions. Right now it's not adding up, if you could point me in the right direction to overcome this problem I'd be extremely grateful!",Buddhism,1704446613.0,t3_18z2uuv,0.5,0

Reincarnation and Torture," I am an agnostic type who believes in some sort of scientific reincarnation.

If your consciousness arises from seemingly nothing, it would be preposterous to claim you couldn't be reborn again after death.

I do not believe there is anything intrinsically special about human consciousness.¬† I think we are just more advanced versions of other animals.

allow this to happen. What is the purpose of putting people through torture. I keep researching the topic and reassuring myself that the pain wouldn't last long.¬†

"Amitabha will always say these three sentences: ‚ÄòMy love, you will always be treasured. You are unable to commit any mistakes. Do not be frightened.‚Äô","
So, when we talk about love, we must first learn to love ourselves. The problem with us is we do not have such ability to love ourselves. But luckily Amitabha Buddha has this power, this ability. So how to love ourselves? We start by feeling the love of Amitabha Buddha. There are three stages.

Firstly, we must listen to the Dharma. The dharma love arises from the Dharma. What is the function of listening to the dharma? The first is to feel the love of Amitabha Buddha. Secondly is to receive and accept the love of Amitabha Buddha. Next is to enjoy the love of Amitabha Buddha.

When you are touched by a dharma talk, this is feeling. You think, ‚ÄòOh, I do not realize Amitabha Buddha loves me so much. He does not impose any conditions. He just wants to rescue me to the World of Ultimate Bliss in the West.‚Äô

So, our dharma door is the door of great protection. It does not matter how terrible you are, how ungrateful you are, how hopeless you are, how stupid you are, how sinful you can be, but if you can recite the Buddha Name, Amitabha will guarantee your attainment of Buddhahood in the Western World of Ultimate Bliss. Amitabha will always say these three sentences:

‚ÄòMy love, you will always be treasured. You are unable to commit any mistakes. Do not be frightened.‚Äô

Amitabha Buddha who loves us will rescue us without setting any conditions. On listening to the Dharma and if we are able to penetrate the thorough love, the ultimately perfect love of the Buddha, we will surely be touched. We will receive and accept His Love. We will be totally subdued when we enjoy the Buddha‚Äôs love for us. After this we can promote this love to others.

SoÔºå the first thing we must learn is to start loving oneself. How do you know if we love ourselves or not? Firstly, check for yourself,

‚ÄòAre you happy?‚Äô ‚ÄìHappy

‚ÄòAre you glad?‚Äô‚Äì we are glad.

‚ÄòYou should be able to laugh!‚Äô‚ÄìHa ha ha

The main point here is to be happy. It does not matter if a man is put into jail. But if his mind is kept in the prison, he is truly jailed. When we are happy and people lock us up in the room, how can they make us unhappy? Happily, you pronounce, ‚ÄòNever mind, it does not matter if you were to lock me in the room.‚Äô I am still happy, right? If you are unhappy, what is the point if you were to go on a tour? Your eye-brows are all locked up. A happy man will not lock up his eye-brows as he is relaxed and comfortable. SoÔºå you must know your two eye-brows are the gate of your house. People take a look at you and they will know your gate is locked.

Happiness resembles the opening of a flower. In the Chinese sayings it is thus stated,

‚ÄòThe flowers of the mind are flourishing.‚Äô

If a flower does not open, there is no fragrance, there is no fruits. How can a flower show its beauty if it does not open up?

In the same way, when our mind flower does not open up in happiness, it cannot reveal the beauty of Buddha recitation.

When our mind flower does not open up, there is no fragrance of Buddha recitation. When our mind flower does not open up it is difficult to reap the fruit of Buddhahood. We must know the opening of the flower is the same as the opening up of a joyful mind flower.

I am interested in Buddhist teachings, especially zen Buddhism, and also the Eight-fold Path of Buddhism, but I am an atheist and I cannot get behind things such as reincarnation...not here to debate, so please let's keep things peaceful and civil.

I am wondering if it's cultural appropriation to draw on ideas from Buddhism to inform and inspire my own philosophy...

I don't claim to be Buddhist and never will claim that, because I feel that would be disrespectful for me to do so....but I'm wondering what's the most respectful way to genuinely engage with Buddhist practices and philosophies without offending Buddhists...

Thank you! :)",Buddhism,1704409769.0,t3_18yr0dq,0.55,6
How to further implement the Dharma into my life?,"For some context, I'm 17 years old and live in the Southern United States's ""bible belt."" I come from a Christian family so I practice Buddhism in private. I don't go to a temple or have a teacher as I'm waiting until I move out and can freely practice my religion without my family's knowledge. So being without a teacher and living in a largely Christian culture, I sometimes have trouble implementing the teachings that I learn about and meditate on.

I've been meditating on equanimity in love and compassion recently, and the meditations have helped a lot. I got the specific meditation that I've been doing for the past couple days from H.H. The Dalai Lama's *Library of Wisdom and Compassion Vol. 1.*

1. Basically I develop a sense that others are kind through remembering their kindness to me, as well as thinking about how even people with ""disruptive"" actions have been so kind as to challenge me to learn forgiveness and patience to help further me along my spiritual path. I think about the infinite past lives and the ways in which all beings have crossed my path in one way or another and been kind to me.
2. I then visualize many different people experiencing kindness as well as extending a wish for them to experience kindness. I start with a few people then spread this to all sentient beings.
3. I then visualize many people being free from suffering and I extend a wish for all beings to be liberated from suffering. I develop a desire to help free all beings from suffering.
4. I then think about all three of these topics in conjunction with each other. i feel a desire to be kind to all beings and to help all beings so that they may be liberated from suffering. I feel a need to take my spirituality seriously so that I may reach buddhahood and help others reach buddhahood as well. I wish to generate good karma so that I can be better prepared to help others.

This meditation works extremely well for me and I go into the day feeling balanced and a sense of compassion for all beings, however, this feeling leaves me once I get started with my day and become preoccupied with school work and other things. I notice myself developing destructive emotions throughout the day such as anger and judgement and don't often end the day feeling good about the things I did, said, and thought. I was wondering if there's anything I can do throughout my day to remind myself of the Buddha's teachings so that I can further implement them? I consider myself very dedicated; lots of my free time is spent learning about Buddhism and practicing Buddhism, I just find trouble remembering to implement the things that I've learned and meditated on while I go about my daily activities. Thank you so much and I apologize for the long read. ",Buddhism,1704409680.0,t3_18yqz5x,0.94,22

Looking for response to Pope John Paul II's take on Buddhism,"So im reading ""Crossing the Threshold of Hope"" by Pope John Paul II. There is a section where he compares Catholicsism to other major world religions. I found his perspective on buddishm to be lacking, and would like a informed counter argument to his main point.   


>The Buddhist doctrine of salvation constitutes the central point, or  rather the only point, of this system. Nevertheless, both the Buddhist  tradition and the methods deriving from it have an almost exclusive  negative soteriology. The ""enlightenment"" experienced by Buddha comes  down to the conviction that the world is bad, that it is the source of  evil and of suffering for man. To liberate oneself from this evil, one  must free oneself from this world, necessitating a break with the ties  that join us to external realities existing in our human nature, in our  psyche, in our bodies. The more we are liberated from these ties, the  more we become indifferent to what is in the world, and the more we are  freed from suffering, from the evil that has its source in the world. Do  we draw near to God in this way? This is not mentioned in the  ""enlightenment"" conveyed by Buddha.  
Buddhism is in large measure an  ""atheistic"" system. We do not free ourselves from evil through the good  which comes from God; we liberate ourselves only through detachment from  the world, which is bad. The fullness of such a detachment is not union  with God, but what is called nirvana, a state of perfect indifference  with regard to the world. To save oneself means, above all, to free  oneself from evil by becoming indifferent to the world, which is the  source of evil. This is the culmination of the spiritual process. At  various times, attempts to link this method with the Christian mystics  have been made - whether it is with those from northern Europe (Eckhart.  Tauler, Suso, Ruysbroeck) or the later Spanish mystics (Saint Teresa of  Avila, Saint John of the Cross). But when Saint John of the Cross, in  the Ascent of Mount Garmel and in the Dark Night of the Soul, speaks of  the need for purification, for detachment from the world of the senses,  he does not conceive of that detachment as an end in itself. ""To arrive  at what now you do not enjoy, you must go where you do not en joy. To  reach what you do not know, you must go where you do not know. To come  into possession of what you do not have, you must go where now you have  nothing"" (Ascent of Mount Carmel, i, 13, ii).

There are a few fundamental assumptions here that I feel are incorrect: 

1. The ""enlightenment"" experienced by Buddha comes  down to the conviction that the world is bad, that it is the source of  evil and of suffering for man.
2.  we liberate ourselves only through detachment from  the world, which is bad
3. what is called nirvana, a state of perfect indifference  with regard to the world
4. To save oneself means, above all, to free  oneself from evil by becoming indifferent to the world

What would be a proper Buddhist response to this? My understanding is that Nirvana/Enlightenment is not about becoming indifferent to the world, but rather a full awareness of the fundamental reality of the world. 

Is my understanding correct? What Buddhist texts would you use to support/refute the Popes argument here.

"My thoughts on non-self (also, a request for feedback and an invitation to book free meditation teaching sessions with me)","Hey everyone! This is my first post to r/Buddhism (and really also on Reddit!). I am cross-posting this from my blog titled [Love Yourself Unconditionally](https://adityaaswani.substack.com/). I am new to blogging so any feedback you have on my writing would be welcome! I am also interested in becoming a meditation teacher so I am offering free meditation teaching sessions! So if you found my manner of explaining things helpful, you‚Äôre welcome to book a free session with me here on [Calendly](https://calendly.com/adityaaswani/one-on-one-meditation-teaching). Anyways, without further ado, here‚Äôs my post (you can find the original post [here](https://adityaaswani.substack.com/p/what-does-non-self-mean-in-buddhism))! :)

# What Does ""Non-self"" Mean in Buddhism?

*A Hopefully Accessible Explainer*

[Paro Taktsang Temple in the Himalayas. Credits to Sam Power via Unsplash.](https://preview.redd.it/zrvdepenbhac1.jpg?width=4286&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5d533f9ebc747277f3c8958244d51308ce076ce0)

# Explained Conceptually

To explain non-self, one must do so with the proper context. Let‚Äôs start with my paraphrased version of the Buddha‚Äôs first teaching:

1. All beings are conditioned to suffer.
2. The root cause of suffering is clinging.
3. We can end our suffering by letting go of clinging.
4. The way to let go of clinging is by following the [Eightfold Path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path).

These points above are known as the [Four Noble Truths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Noble_Truths)  (I will gloss over the Eightfold Path for now as it deserves its own blog post). So as the Buddha stated, the key to ending our suffering is by letting go of clinging. So what is clinging? Clinging refers to the felt sense of wanting to get the things we currently do not have and wanting to keep the things we currently do have.

We must also explain the idea of self. When the Buddha talked about the self, he usually talked about it in the context of ‚Äú[I-making‚Äù and ‚Äúmy-making](https://tricycle.org/magazine/there-no-self/).‚Äù  These refer to the mental process of us defining all things through this dualistic lens either being me/mine or not being me/mine. For example, we may notice thoughts like ‚ÄúI am my body, I am an American, this my family, this is my property,‚Äù etc.

In this context, we can think of non-self as the process of gradually feeling less clinging to the things that we previously, maybe very strongly, identified with. And as we loosen this clinging, we can gradually reduce our suffering as well.

# Explained Experientially

As I have gradually deepened my understanding of non-self, I have noticed my mind incline towards less suffering in the following ways. Please note that I am still fairly new to the path (only around a year in), so I still have a long way to go in cultivating a more comprehensive understanding of non-self. 

## Less Identification

&#x200B;

[Credits to DALL‚Ä¢E.](https://preview.redd.it/rrot59subhac1.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9ffcda7f76c2a06e31cde2e063c89b946d28538)

I now feel far less identified with things that I used to very strongly identify with. For example, as a 5‚Äô 5‚Äù man based in New York City, I used to feel very insecure about my height. For context, the average height of men in NYC is 5‚Äô10‚Äù. I would regularly be stressed about how all the cards were stacked against me, especially in a dating context, because women, on average, seem to prefer taller men. I  remember also frequenting the [r/short](https://www.reddit.com/r/short/) subreddit, where I would commiserate with my fellow short humans. 

What really drove the nail in the coffin was sometimes seeing people on the subreddit who were a few inches taller than me still complaining about how short they were. If even they don‚Äôt have a chance, then what hope do I have? I strongly believed that because I was short, I was doomed to be single forever, and if I couldn‚Äôt get a girlfriend, then I was doomed to die alone, so I would never be truly happy. These were the kinds of stories I would tell myself and fully believe.

It feels so fascinating to reminisce about some of the mental states that used to be present in my mind. Regardless, I am grateful to say that now, around a year later, I rarely, if ever, think about my height at all. After making some progress on the path, I have come to more clearly see that happiness is something that does come from within and that while things like our height, weight, wealth, job, love life, etc., can be things that pull our attention away from this inner happiness, they can never  extinguish it.

## Less Value Judgements

Another way non-self has helped reduce my suffering is by allowing me to feel like events in my life are not inherently good or bad. The channel Pursuit of Wonder has a great six-minute YouTube video explaining this concept. I encourage you to watch it:

[https://youtu.be/oGVhOWqsBWM](https://youtu.be/oGVhOWqsBWM)

In essence, this is tied to this other idea known as [emptiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A%C5%ABnyat%C4%81). Emptiness states that no thing is inherently anything. This is best exemplified by sayings like [one man‚Äôs trash is another man‚Äôs treasure](https://usdictionary.com/idioms/one-mans-trash-is-another-mans-treasure/), or that [beauty is in the eye of the beholder](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/beauty-is-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder).

I was very grateful to have an embodied understanding of this concept when I was let go from my job earlier this month. Admittedly, the news was not so surprising as I was on a performance improvement plan (PIP)  for two months prior (for those of you unaware, PIPs are sometimes used as a formality before letting someone go as opposed to being a plan of action to help an employee improve their performance). Regardless, I did feel quite devastated. While I cannot say I was deeply passionate about my last job, I can say it was a rather good job that I was very grateful to have had.

[Credits to DALL‚Ä¢E.](https://preview.redd.it/rmc7nhd7chac1.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c3b832c28d5abd31727b7146b333c5401af0a45)

Anyway, it felt beautiful to notice how, despite this troubling news, I have felt mostly peaceful. There have even been times when I have felt quite optimistic about the future. I think about how this  challenging life event has the potential to be looked back upon as a turning point that led to greater things. 

I will not deny that there have been times when I have felt some stress about the uncertainty of the future. But overall, I would say that I see this event as largely neutral. I think I‚Äôll need to wait a few years to see how my life unfolds to get a true sense of whether this event resulted in my life going in a more skillful or less skillful direction. Admittedly, even at that point, I cannot know for sure.

## Less Separation

Let‚Äôs say we take this idea of emptiness a step further. As I mentioned  earlier, no thing is inherently anything; this applies not only to objects and events but also to living beings. Furthermore, this not only applies in terms of value judgments (pleasant, neutral, unpleasant) but also concepts generally. What do I mean by this?

Let‚Äôs take a dog, for example. What exactly is a dog? A dog is just a label that we have given to a certain group of animals that fit a certain set of criteria. If there were no humans, there would be no concept of dogs. Obviously, the subset of animals that the label dog refers to would still exist, but the concept itself would not. The concept only exists in our minds.

[While the concept of dogs is subjective, their cuteness is objective üòç. Credits to Maksym Tymchyk via Unsplash.](https://preview.redd.it/sf8avkbechac1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d6962220513a605f2ec636b4d3939f7d5955a049)

Now let‚Äôs take this another step further: Humans. The idea of emptiness can be used to understand ourselves as well. These labels we give ourselves of Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jew, and Muslim are all  concepts that exist only in our minds. While these labels can be a great  source of community, belonging, and identity, they also, by definition, are a source of separation. And it is with this foundation of separation that we can fuel narratives of ‚Äúus‚Äù vs. ‚Äúthem‚Äù and justify inflicting large amounts of suffering to our fellow humans.

While I have previously heard these ideas of ‚Äúeverything is connected‚Äù and ‚Äúwe‚Äôre all one,‚Äù I just viewed them as something a hippie would say while they‚Äôre high. I never realized that this could be a more accurate picture of reality.

This past year was likely one of the most difficult years of my life in terms of my mental health. During  this time, I was quite desperate in searching for and trying out a variety of healing modalities. One of the methods I tried was a [silent meditation retreat](https://www.dharma.org/retreats/faqs/). 

During a retreat, one alternates between sitting and [walking meditation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking_meditation)  all day. The main breaks from meditation are meals and a daily lecture about Buddhist teachings. Also, the entire retreat is in silence,  meaning there is no talking outside of asking teachers questions. They also firmly recommend not reading, writing, using electronics, or even looking at others. Retreats can be as short as half a day or as long as months or years. So far, the longest retreat I have done is a week, though I hope to someday do a [three-month retreat](https://www.dharma.org/retreats/forest-refuge/). 

I found my retreats very helpful, and during one of them, I specifically  went in with the intention of gaining a deeper understanding of non-self. During that retreat, I had this peculiar yet powerful insight of seeing all of life as if it were one of those facial cleanser bottles with those exfoliating beads.

[Credits to DALL‚Ä¢E.](https://preview.redd.it/far98czjchac1.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=975dea4365eb163fffe2a6162b30df8ef7b26e51)

Just as a bottle of facial cleanser with beads has them suspended in these somewhat random clusters, some relatively dense while others rather sparse, so too is all of existence. I have come to see that the  whole universe is in many ways a large collection of particles that happens to be more densely clustered in certain patterns in some areas and more loosely clustered in different patterns in other areas. These patterns and clusters, by themselves, are completely neutral without any concepts. It is we humans, sometimes for better and sometimes for worse, who decide to add labels to these patterns. And it is when we take these concepts too seriously and identify with them too strongly that we suffer.

It feels beautiful to have a deeper, more embodied sense of the interconnectedness of all existence. I think it has made me a kinder person than before, and I hope that as I deepen my understanding of this idea, my mind‚Äôs inclination toward kindness will also continue to deepen. It‚Äôs also pretty cool how the most mundane things can teach us fundamental features of the universe.

# Knowledge vs. Wisdom

>And‚Äîthus is my thought, oh exalted one,‚Äînobody will obtain salvation by means of  teachings! You will not be able to convey and say to anybody, oh venerable one, in words and through teachings what has happened to you in the hour of enlightenment! The teachings of the enlightened Buddha contain much, it teaches many to live righteously, to avoid evil. But there is one thing which these so clear, these so venerable teachings do not contain: **they do not contain the mystery of what the exalted one has experienced for himself**, he alone among hundreds of thousands.

[Credits to DALL‚Ä¢E.](https://preview.redd.it/zqhyhkcuchac1.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=8362006c3c5682043efebf4796a43b475db9c581)

Now that I have finished sharing my thoughts on non-self, I would like to distinguish between knowledge and wisdom. The excerpt above is from the amazing novel [*Siddhartha*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_(novel))  by Herman Hesse. In this moment, our protagonist, Siddhartha, is having a conversation with the Buddha named Gotama. By the way, ‚ÄúBuddha‚Äù is a title meaning ‚Äúthe awakened one.‚Äù

*Side note: Some of  you may know that the real-life Buddha‚Äôs name was Siddhartha Gautama, so this may be somewhat confusing. To clarify, in the novel, the novel version of Siddhartha is merely someone completely unrelated to the novel version or real-life Buddha while the novel version of the Buddha is based on the real-life Buddha.*

In this quote, Siddhartha is in essence saying that while he fully agrees with the Buddha‚Äôs teachings, he does not wish to become his follower. This is because no matter how amazing the teachings may be, they are, at the end of the day, just that, teachings, i.e., knowledge. What Siddhartha says he really wants is the direct experience that those teachings spring from, i.e., wisdom.

To further drive the point home, imagine you want to learn a new skill, let‚Äôs say, how to successfully run a business. To learn this new skill, one can watch YouTube tutorials, read books, hire a coach, or even go to business school. All of these things can be quite valuable, but can only impart knowledge. Only through the direct experience of starting a business and trying to run it can one accrue the wisdom of how to run a business successfully.

So where am I going with all this? I believe you should see this post and anything outside your direct experience as ‚Äúknowledge.‚Äù To understand non-self (or anything else in life) more deeply, I encourage you to consider testing the idea for yourself. In the context of Buddhist ideas like non-self, the best lab would be meditation (in particular, a silent retreat!). The Buddha himself said not to take anything he or others say at face value and instead determine for yourself through your own contemplation what is and is not true^(1).

# Conclusion and an Invitation

Thank you for reading my blog! Feel free to let me know any comments, questions, or feedback you have! I am very new to blogging, so any input you have would be greatly appreciated üòä.

Although I mentioned earlier that direct experience is best, that does not mean knowledge does not help! With that in mind, I invite you to schedule a [free meditation teaching session](https://calendly.com/adityaaswani/one-on-one-meditation-teaching)  with me on Calendly! üòÑ To be clear, I am not currently a teacher! As mentioned before, I am fairly new to the path, with only around a year of focused practice. Regardless, I can provide helpful guidance for people who consider themselves absolute beginners.

Also, as I would like to become a proper teacher someday, I see these sessions as an opportunity for me to learn how to teach. As such, these sessions will be free for the foreseeable future. I want to ensure that I have much more experience before switching to a donation-based ([Dana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C4%81na)) or sliding-scale model later on.

Of course, if you are looking for a more experienced teacher, I encourage you to do that! I personally had a teacher I met with once a week for about a year to help guide me through my practice, and I can say I found it immensely beneficial.

Anyway, thank you again for reading my blog and considering my invitation! Sending [metta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maitr%C4%AB) ‚ù§Ô∏è.

I felt it in my bones, so I launched and went straight at him to fight him and then I got stopped by this elder monk, very calm, without words told me to get on my knees and pray with him instead. So I prayed with him.

He was quiet and all those negative things slowly went away for good, strange creepy guy included (he was screaming his lungs out), everything felt comfortingly violent around while it was happening, but I had my eyes closed, on my knees just praying. He disappeared and then the temple started to crumble slowly and disappear top to bottom and me with it, but the entire violent part around me while being still in my prayer felt almost therapeutic in a way and then I woke up.

For like solid hour everything around me did not feel very real. I feel like I was still somewhere else still stuck. I'm not considering myself religious (I grew up christian), but it was a very real dream and it was very obviously a dream, and I don't know if it has any meaning, but I wanted to share this experience with people who practice this religion and know ins and outs. How our brains can construct such experiences is absolutely wild and I wondered about what it might mean if it really means anything.

So Grateful,"Idk where else to put this but the more i read the Dharma the more i am just filled with joy for real. I discovered Buddhism at a very young age in a normal history class. My teachers was one of the only ones qualified to teach religion funny enough. He explained every major world religion and even though I was raised in a STRICT Christian household, Buddhism caught my eye. I began to study it and read the sutras and it wasn‚Äôt until about three years later when i really could say that i started to make an attempt to follow the precepts and meditate daily. I would do acts of generosity almost everyday for my parents and meditate in nature on the swing that was in my backyard, surrounded by trees. It was the most peaceful summer ever i swear and everytime i breathed i felt the wind blow through the trees like we were breathing together. I was far too young to really understand the essence of what the Dharma teaches though, so eventually as i got older and filled with more worldly responsibilities i strayed terribly. I‚Äôm just returning from a service trip to Africa and I felt instantly reconnected with the practice. I began to study and read again and it‚Äôs so much sweeter being that I‚Äôm at an age where I can truly comprehend just how wise the Tathagata really is. So graceful with words and so logical, the Dharma truly saved me. Where I‚Äôm located it‚Äôs not very common to practice Buddhism either so I often get questions from friends. I recently sat down and explained my beliefs to one of my best friends with no intention of swaying his mind just to answer his questions but i think i may have converted him on accident üò≠ He was so amazed at how logical and peaceful it is and how he was able to apply it to every area of his life. I felt so blessed to be able to share the Buddha‚Äôs wisdom. How beautiful is the doctrine that all who hear it are instantly moved! ü•πI continue to practice in secret because it would be a huge risk in my family. I wish I didn‚Äôt have to hide, it‚Äôs the most peaceful I‚Äôve ever been.

Four Modes of Samadhi,"[AN 4.41](https://suttacentral.net/an4.41)

‚ÄúMonks, these are the four developments of concentration. Which four? There is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to a pleasant abiding in the here & now. There is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to the attainment of knowledge & vision. There is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to mindfulness & alertness. There is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to the ending of the effluents.

And what is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to a pleasant abiding in the here & now? There is the case where a monk‚Äîquite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful qualities‚Äîenters & remains in the first jhana: rapture & pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation. With the stilling of directed thoughts & evaluations, he enters & remains in the second jhana: rapture & pleasure born of composure, unification of awareness free from directed thought & evaluation‚Äîinternal assurance. With the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, & alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters & remains in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, ‚ÄòEquanimous & mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.‚Äô With the abandoning of pleasure & pain‚Äîas with the earlier disappearance of elation & distress‚Äîhe enters & remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity & mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. This is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to a pleasant abiding in the here & now.

And what is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to the attainment of knowledge & vision? There is the case where a monk attends to the perception of light and is resolved on the perception of daytime [at any hour of the day]. Day [for him] is the same as night, night is the same as day. By means of an awareness open & unhampered, he develops a brightened mind. This is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to the attainment of knowledge & vision.

And what is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to mindfulness & alertness? There is the case where feelings are known to the monk as they arise, known as they persist, known as they subside. Perceptions are known to him as they arise, known as they persist, known as they subside. Thoughts are known to him as they arise, known as they persist, known as they subside. This is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to mindfulness & alertness.

And what is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to the ending of the effluents? There is the case where a monk remains focused on arising & falling away with reference to the five clinging-aggregates: ‚ÄòSuch is form, such its origination, such its passing away. Such is feeling, such its origination, such its passing away. Such is perception, such its origination, such its passing away. Such are fabrications, such their origination, such their passing away. Such is consciousness, such its origination, such its disappearance.‚Äô This is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to the ending of the effluents.

These are the four developments of concentration.

And it was in connection with this that I stated in Punnaka‚Äôs Question in the [Way to the Far Shore](https://suttacentral.net/snp-parayanavagga):

‚ÄòHe who has fathomed
the far & near in the world,

"Readings around ""modernist"" movements for Buddhism?","In Muslim circles, different movements arose in response to historical-critical scholarship. For example, due to many issues brought up in Western academia (bias, anachronisms, discontinuities, etc), a growing number of Muslims are very critical of ·∏•adƒ´·πØ. Some reject them all. While their core tenents remain (e.g. monotheism), this has many implications theologically, juridically, and practically.

&#x200B;

As many of these approaches grew out of biblical scholarship, I've read similar accounts of Jewish and Christian scholars reconciling faith with critical scholarship ‚Äì with many rejecting orthodox positions, literal interpretations (e.g. of the Exodus), et cetera.

Medicine Buddha Question,"I've been learning the different schools if Buddhism, interested in maybe picking one? I'm still figuring myself out. Anyway I came across Medicine Buddha randomly. (I honestly don't remember where). I really liked this Buddha though, almost drawn to him. 

I don't work in the medical field, but I have suffered from health anxiety my whole life. It's...somewhat under control. (It was real bad in my late 20s) I do have a slight interest in medicine, but not enough to make it a job. Just like helping people when I can and learn enough to curb my anxieties. 

I'm a bit confused about how Medicine Buddha fits into the schools though. My research isn't telling me much. I get his mantras and his 12 vows, which I like both. A small bit of history, but nothing on which schools he belongs in. I know it's mostly Mahayana, but it rarely specifies further. 

I've seen a bit of him mentioned in Pure Land, but all Pure Land research talks about Amitabha. 

I've also seen him mentioned in Tibetan Buddhism, but I'm still trying to wrap my head around that school. I like it but it's a lot to learn, so I don't know how he fits in exactly. 

So where does the Medicine Buddha belong? If I do decide to start one of the schools of Buddhism whichever one has Medicine Buddha may be the first I look into. I just don't know which one that is.

Seeking Insight on Constructing Guided Meditations for Research,"‚Äã‚ÄãI'm currently embarking on a self-directed 4th-year psychology research project that aims to measure the differential effects of three types of meditation‚ÄîShamatha, Vipassana, and Metta‚Äîconducted within a virtual nature setting on self-reported Connectedness to Nature (CTN) and Perceived Restorativeness of enviornments (PR).

‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãUpon reviewing the literature surrounding my topic, there appears to be a lack of standardized or theoretically supported guidelines for creating guided meditations across the types I wish to study. This lack has implications for the validity and reliability of comparative analysis within meditation research, something I'm keen to address with my project.

I have a foundational understanding of these meditation techniques through personal practice and literature but am seeking deeper, more nuanced insights. Specifically, I'm looking for guidance on creating effective, theoretically sound guided meditation instructions that align well with the intended meditative practices.

What I'm Seeking:

Recommendations on Texts or Manuals: I'm seeking specific meditation manuals or original texts that best represent the techniques of Shamatha, Vipassana, and Metta. Understanding there are variances within each type, I am interested in texts or teachings that are considered foundational or particularly illustrative of the practices.

I am open to any criticism, corrections, or insights you might have. If you prefer a more detailed discussion, I'm also open to private messages or setting up a call to discuss further. Your input will not only aid in the advancement of this particular research but also contribute to the larger body of knowledge surrounding meditation, connectedness to nature, and psychological well-being.

Thank you in advance for your time and assistance. I look forward to engaging in fruitful discussions and learning from this community!

P.S Trait mindfulness and meditation experience will be covariates (or possible mediators/moderators) in this study so I can observe how the intervention's effects are influenced by both meditation experience and trait mindfulness. I am aware of the issues surrounding self-reported measures however my budget is literally 0$ for this study so I'm working with what I have and what has been used already in the literature :)",Buddhism,1704338373.0,t3_18y2u7i,0.33,0
Buddha appearing as an incarnation of evil,"I‚Äôm currently reading the teachings of buddha, but I came across this passage that just confused me:

‚Äú4. Buddha does not always appear as a Buddha. Sometimes he appears as an incarnation of evil, sometimes as a woman, a god, a king, a statesman; sometimes he appears in a brothel or in a gambling house, and in an epidemic he appears as a physician bringing healing; but always he is preaching and manifesting the Dharma, for the emancipation of the world.‚Äù

„ÄäDiamond Sutra„Äã:

‚ÄúBy detachment from appearances-abiding in Real Truth. -So I tell you-

Thus shall you think of all this fleeting world:

A star at dawn, a bubble in a stream;

A flash of lightening in a summer cloud,

A flickering lamp, a phantom, and a dream.‚Äù

Master Da'an:

The Pure Land Dharma requires us to recite Amitabha Buddha's name, and establish a body image of Amitabha Buddha; it establishes the majesty of the Western Pure Land; and it requires us to seek rebirth in the direction of the Pure Land. It seems that there is a contradiction in what the Diamond Sutra says, but it appears to be contradictory, but in fact it is not contradictory.

They are both perfect interpenetration and mutual inclusion. One is from the level of True Realm of Reality. The level of True Realm of Reality is to sweep away everything without establishing a single speck of dust. One is from the perspective of secular truth, it establishes everything. In the Diamond Sutra, Prajna emptiness enters from the teaching of emptiness, so it must sweep away all forms; the Pure Land Dharma is implemented from the teaching that acknowledges the existence of characteristics, and this Dharma must establish the phase. But this phase is not the phase of our sentient being‚Äôs karma. It is the phase that appears from the pure heart and merits of Amitabha Buddha, and it is the marvelous existence that arises from the true emptiness. This marvelous existence is equivalent to true emptiness, and the marvelous existence of true emptiness is two sides of one body. This is called ""the marvelous phenomena state of the ultimate truth"". Therefore, through such a marvelous existence, one can enter into the Dharmakaya Tathagata, which is the ""embodiment of truth"".

Therefore, the convenience of the Pure Land method lies in ""pointing to the direction to establish the form, and living in the form to realize the Buddhahood."" Instruct the Western Pure Land to establish the appearance of Amitabha's form and sound, the appearance of good images, and the appearances of the Paradise of Ultimate Bliss, which is upright and solemn. These sounds, Amitabha's name, and the upright and solemn state of the Paradise are all manifestations of reality. Therefore, by living in this phase, you can realize the fruit of reality. This is why the facilities of the Dharma are different, but they are the same at home.",Buddhism,1704335788.0,t3_18y1xof,0.95,18

Is there a way to distance myself emotionally from my family? Please read. May sound off topic and selfish but i cannot think of anywhere where I can ask this question. So please help,"So i need to be with my family at least for the next three years, more if i dont put my emotions in order. See i asked psychologists but i find them very stupid and pseudoscientific. You see my family is very vain and money obsessed. They get plastic surgery, and since i live in a country full of corruption, doctors are willing to do whatever they can. I need to finish college to get a job, But when i talk about this to my psych she just says ""let them do whatever they can, you should love them and accept them"". Yes, like if i shouldnt be affected if they end up creepled in a hospital tied to some machines. if things keep going as they have been going for years thats what is going to happen. The irony is that they are supposed to control my life, they locked me up because i was suicidal and i smoke pot (and the shrinks said that it was obviously the pot, not their body dysmorphia and obsession with money) i came out from that hole unable to tak and they blame me (you just dont want to be happy).

&#x200B;

Thats a resum√©, its just that i thought maybe there is some kind of meditation i can do to kinda take an emotional distance of them. I mean not hating them, but get some distance. Like y'all. I mean you can read this and have compassion for people who have body dysmorphia, but you dont get totally crazy thinking about the innevetable. Thats what i want for myself. I dont live with them, since i have my own house. My dad passed away and i moved out from home because i got a house. But i havent finished college, and i still depend on the family enterprise. My plan is finish college and then cut them out from my life ASAP. But first i need to take control of this emotions. They dont listen.

See it this way friends, its like depending on people who will destroy their lives because of drugs addiction, it hurst because i grew up with them, but there is nothing i can do, they will have to learn the hard way, and when the time comes up i dont want to be emotionally involved. 

I know it may sound selfish but i am tired, i have pseudodementia because of my depression. It comes and goes. Buddhism has helped me a lot and i have faith in it.

Guanyin and the Oracle,"I recently visited a Taoist temple and since I was there I decided to go for the oracle at the altar of Guanyin (Kuan Yin). I'm a huge fan of I Ching, but the way I see I Ching is not as a divination/oracle/prophecy book but as ancient wisdom about human condition and existence in general distilled into powerful archetypes. The only reason I Ching survived numerous book tome burnings and destruction is that it wasn't taken seriously as a philosophy book as the authorities thought it was just a soothsayer brochure. I am curious about the oracle of Guanyin. Do people take it seriously and live accordingly? What if you get not a good lot from the oracle? Can you try it again or do you have to wait for a certain time? Or do the educated Taoists/Buddhists take it as ancient teaching disguised as oracle like the I Ching?

Not interested in happiness,"Hello. I have been studying Buddhist teachings for a while, and the more I learn, the more Buddhism resonates with me.

However, there is something strange. A lot of the texts, both translations and commentary, revolve around finding true happiness - the happiness that doesn't harm anyone, that is boundless and unconditional, etc. It seems that everything we do on this path is designed to bring us closer to that happiness. My issue is that I have no interest in it. I'm not depressed or gloomy, I'm just not motivated by all this talk about happiness, which is absolutely everywhere. My interest in Buddhism stems from something different, although I struggle to put my finger on it.

Every time I hear that we should do something because it will lead to true happiness, I lose a bit of spirit, because it feels like I'm following an interesting road that leads to a destination I couldn't care less about. It affects my motivation in some cases. For example, practicing goodwill involves wishing everyone happiness, including yourself, which is emphasised in the literature all the time. I struggle to do this sincerely. Again, it is not because I think I don't deserve happiness; rather, it is because I simply don't care for it. It's not my goal.

I would like to hear what Buddhists or other interested persons have to say. Is all the talk about happiness just a teaching tool to motivate most people, or is it truly essential? I could not find a post similar to this, forgive me if I missed something. Thank you for reading!

And that it has increased exponentially within the last 100 years or so, and in my own personal perspective shows no signs of stopping or even slowing.

Sanghas that focus on fellowship?,"As an American Buddhist, I've found many groups to be a bit skimpy on the social / community aspect. We get together to silently meditate or listen to teachings, but structured opportunities to interact and build spiritual friendships seem a bit thin.

Is anyone aware of sanghas that expressly focus on creating opportunities for sangha members to interact and get to know each other? I'd strongly prefer in-person over Zoom, and I'd love it if they have a presence in the Bay Area, ideally the East Bay.

If there are no deities in Theravada, what are the chants, and do you reap benefits from them, in the same sense you do from Mahayana Bodhisattvas?

Trouble dealing with awful family issues and trying to do the right thing..,"I'm trying  to be kind, compassionate, and understanding as I know that's the way I should be, but fighting the urge to freak out on family. 


     My grandparents passed 7 and 9 years ago, and my mom took care of them for the last 6 years of their lives.  She dropped everything and spent the good years of her retirement looking after her folks so they didn't have to go into nursing home.  Very shortly after, my dad passed, unexpectedly and my mom has so much to deal with. She's early 70s but stress and family disfunction amongst her crazy sisters has taken its toll on her spirit, physical and mental health.   

Grandfather enabled one particular sister of my moms to be worthless and dependent, and have victim mentality to the point she can't take care of herself and now uses and abuses my mom.  She abuses everyone in her circle, including her 2 children who are adult age.  My mom has continued enabling, because she doesn't want to see her sister suffer, but all her problems are her own doing. .  Sister is mentally abusive, blames all her problems on everyone else, and takes full advantage of my mom's kindness and compassion. 

      There is alot of money involved, and that's not so much my worry, as is my mom, her happiness, quality of life, mental health and such.  I'm very angry and disgusted and trying to help my mom navigate this whole situation, without freaking out myself, and losing my shit on the crazy aunt who won't ever learn or understand how toxic she is.  I'm at my wits end on this one.  So much that I'm losing sleep over it.  My mom is a little over the top with her Christian beliefs and thinks I'm wrong for not subscribing to that as ive been folllowing the teachings of buddhism for the majority of my adult life, so theres that riff to contend with as well.  

    Any advice from my fellow compassionate humans on how to navigate this to a peaceful end would be greatly appreciated.

calling yourself a Buddhist,"for about 15 years I have explored a variety of faith communities and just been very interested in religion overall. i have never really felt the need to label my participation or obtain membership to any community‚Äî claim or be claimed. i was involved with in person communities, where belonging was affirmed through gathering. even then, i had an aversion to over-identifying with the religions themselves.

my relationship to buddhism different; it is unattached to a tangible community or temple environment. without people around me or participation in a community, i guess i am having a difficult time validating my involvement or affiliation. and i don‚Äôt feel as much resistance towards commitment/identification as i have before, which may be adding to this sense of wanting to be in community.

has anyone else had experience with this? has there a sort of threshold in your involvement/association? what kind of permission or welcoming did you experience?

Solo beginner looking for advice and/or guidance,"hello all,

i grew up in the chicago area, and over the summer i was attending a kadampa meditation center close to my home. but unfortunately i am in canada for university. there is a buddhist facility near-ish to my campus but transportation is difficult without a car and the meeting are late and night so i don‚Äôt feel entirely comfortable taking public transportation that late as a solo young woman. i am in a small town so that once center is really the only option. 

the temple i attended over the summer reccomended some books to go along with their lessons (written by venerable geshe kelsang gyatso) that i have with me at university. i suppose that is a good place to start, but i am weary of leaning completely by myself. for a multitude of reasons (appropriation, false teachings, incorrect practices, etc). i am really just asking what i should be doing, if anything. maybe the best course of action is to wait until im done with university, but i have 3.5 years left :/

if anyone has any suggestions, maybe online centers, resources to look at, etc. i also apologize if this exact question has been asked before. i am new to the sub and completely useless on reddit.

I have a Sak Yant tattoo done properly by an Ajarn. I want to get it removed. Will this create bad luck.,"A bit ago I received a Sak Yang tattoo.

I‚Äôve come to a point where I want to get the tattoo removed because I do not like the way it looks on my body.

Story about the Buddha and Mara,"I've been listening to an audiobook titled ""No mud no lotus"" It is a book teaching readers about suffering from a Buddhist perspective.

Around halfway through the book there is a story about the Buddha in a cave with his disciple Ananda, Mara shows up wanting an audience with the Buddha, and the Buddha welcomes him and talks to him like an old friend, even has tea with Mara. 

In the story Mara is upset because nobody will follow him. The Buddha tells him that they both have their roles to play.

"If A Person Desires Something But Does Nothing To Obtain That Desire, Should They Give In?","The title relates to me and my goals. There are things I wish to accomplish in my life like reading or exercising or eating healthy, yet it's been hard trying to do so. So far, it's been very difficult, as I get distracted easily on my phone. It's been a couple years of this and since this past new year's day, I've been feeling very, very regretful about my actions and choices. I've tried many things to stop my phone usage and exercise more, but it hasn't worked for me. 

Is it better then, to stop trying or try to rid myself of this desire so that I don't have any regret? After all, my goals are not required for my survival--with modern medicine, I can expect to live a decently long life, and I'm already doing well in my schooling, which will help with my career to earn money and feed myself.

So what's the point? Why not just give up on goals that are non-essential? I thought of asking this in this subreddit as I heard of the Buddhda's teachings on suffering coming from desire--if I rid myself of this desire, will I be happier?

To What Degree is This Stance from the Surangama Sutra Anti-Vajrayana?,"Hey everyone - to contextualize this post, I recently took refuge within a Tibetan Buddhist temple and am a very new practitioner of Vajrayana - essentially taking part in offerings and ceremonies as well as empowerments while practicing shamatha meditation. I've been reading The Surangama Sutra and have found it very profound, but came across the following quote from it today. I'm wondering to what degree this quote might constitute anti-Vajrayana sentiment, whether given the historical context it may be an intentional or unintentional slight to Tibetan Buddhism and specifically the concept of sexual tantric practice:

""No matter how much you may practice in order to transcend the stress of entanglement with perceived objects, you will never transcend that stress until you have freed yourself from sexual desire. Even very intelligent people who can enter samadhi while practicing meditation in stillness will be certain to fall into the realm of demons upon their rebirth if they have not renounced **sexual activity**. The best among them will become kings among demons; those at intermediate levels will be members of demon hordes; female demons will be at the lowest levels. These demons will attract groups of disciples and will tell them that they have realized unsurpassed enlightenment.""

The teachings against sexual desire aren't surprising, but it does specifically point out sexual activity as not only a downfall but something inevitably corruptive of Buddha's teachings and even demonic. I'm curious as to thoughts on this stance and to what degree it might be either propagandistic or hyperbolized. ",Buddhism,1704227891.0,t3_18wzmy6,0.63,2

What‚Äôs a universal word for the state of mindful observation?,"When I share my meditation practice and the practice of active awareness of the ego, I struggle to describe it or even have a word for what I‚Äôm talking about.

Attainment of Nirvana and even its quest seems nigh Impossible,"Based on my brief 10 day meditation course at Igatpuri few years back, I did learn Vipassana meditation but needless to say, I neglected regular practice. Based on my discussion with few other folks who had attended with me, they also reciprocate my same feeling. They felt good for a while but eventually, we tend to remember that we are Engineers, not Monks!

The system S.N. Goenka ji taught is based entirely on the realization of *Anitya* (impermanence) which is only possible once craving and aversion are entirely stopped. But the obvious flaw in the system is: *Where will the motivation to remove craving and aversion in life come from?*

At a theoretical level, I can understand that they're the reason for *dukkha* (suffering) but considering that the desire for cessation of dukkha or attainment of Nirvana itself is a kind of craving, it's almost like an infinite loop. Why will the ""establishment of cravings"" inside your mind ever let that happen? A loop will always want to repeat itself and not end. Once in a while, I do tend to escape its grip and meditate for a few hours (like I did today) but that happens only occasionally. It's almost like fighting your mind itself at some level.

What I've observed is that despite the realism of almost infinite miseries or *dukkha* like depression, loss of relatives, financial issues, etc. in my life, there is also a solid counter force to it called *Hope* which makes the dukkha feel tiny in comparison. Hope makes you forget dukkha and thus leads you away from the path of Nirvana!

I just don't know what I should do to motivate myself more to perform Vipassana meditation regularly. All approaches are welcome, be it pragmatic, theoretical or philosophical.",Buddhism,1704223364.0,t3_18wxqn0,0.87,18

Is knowingly trying to farm karma ok?,"I ask because if you avoid doing something to avoid bad karma I don‚Äôt think anyone would disagree with that, however if you do something  good for the sake of farming karma to contribute to a better future life all of a sudden your exact motivation is in question, and possibly won‚Äôt get karma for it. (I think)
When it comes to avoiding bad karma, your motivation is arbitrary. Does that mean that you still committed that act because deep down you really wanted to do it?
Then conversely, say you lived a terrible life and you‚Äôre on your death bed and out of fear of Hell you donated more money to charity that has ever been donated. Does that money that will go to greatly decreasing the suffering of others become arbitrary because that individual didn‚Äôt have the exact motivation necessary to reap the benefits of that charitable act?",Buddhism,1704215102.0,t3_18wuaer,0.78,21
The Result of Craving.,"I know this is not a political sub.  But, I want to offer an example of what happens when someone is so entrapped by craving, delusion of self, and subsequently, samsara.  

In order to reduce our suffering, and those of others, we must develop and show compassion.  I am suggesting that we include Mr. Donald Trump in our loving kindness meditations.

You can tell from everything that is happening that he is suffering.  We are suffering observing the consequences of his entrapment, his craving, his toxic view of self, and the hinderances he has to end his suffering.  

May all beings be safe and secure.

May all beings have their spiritual and materials needs fulfilled.

May all beings be healthy and happy.

May all beings be at peace.

"What is the best Buddhist method, to help with OCD?","Hello all, and I appreciate you taking the time to read this, I hope this post finds you well. I suffer from severe OCD, and I cannot afford medication or therapy, so those options for me are not currently available, in case anyone says I need to go see a doctor/therapist. I've come from Christianity to Buddhism, because I have found that Christianity does not deal well in the realm of the mind, and it's afflictions. However Buddhism does, and I find that it's full of methods, and Buddha was a master of the mind as well.

In regards to my question, I am looking to deepen my practice in general, but also looking to see if there is any type of method I can use to at the very least alleviate my OCD? The current theme of OCD I'm suffering from is hyperawareness, specifically hyperaware to time. I'm aware of every seconds that passes, my mind can't escape it, and it creates extreme anxiety, because there's no end to it. It creates delusional, irrational thoughts, time isn't relative to what I'm doing because I'm aware of it, no matter what doing. 

So, returning to the now, being mindful, returning to the breath, is precisely what my OCD is fixated on lol. It would be exchanging one fixation for another, focus on time or focus on breath, is like focusing on blinking, being mindful of the now, all the exact same thing, so I'm not sure what to do, because it all creates extreme anxiety, and irrational thoughts and delusions trying to figure out how to end the anxiety which in this case has no compulsions, because these things can't in and of themselves be stopped, it's just an infinite fixation that I cannot stop, and don't know how to overcome, until I fall asleep at night and the cycle continues the second I wake up in the morning.

I didn't know if anyone was aware of any other kinds of techniques, mantras, distractions, simply practicing good and avoiding bad  what the Buddha might have to say on subject, etc? Like I said, I can't afford a doctor or therapist, so those options aren't available to me. Any and all information, anyone would be willing to offer would be most appreciated, at the present moment the Buddha seems to be my only hope. Namaste, and may you all be well and happy.",Buddhism,1704211997.0,t3_18wt1aq,0.76,4

Can Bhava-tanha (craving to become) be used for good?,"It was eye-opening to me to learn about Bhava-tanha, the craving to become something or achieve something. In Western society, we're usually taught this is a good thing. Set a goal, and constantly keep it in mind, constantly visualize success, it's fine to crave the achievement of the goal - this is how you become successful.

Less so in Buddhism. Craving to become, even if the Goal is enlightenment, is a no no because it leads to attachment. An *aspiration* is okay, but there is a big, yet subtle, difference between aspiration and strong desire with some element of craving.

This made me think of Arnold Schwarzenegger's philosophy. He is one of my inspirations. And he talks about being filled with desire for the Mr. Olympia title, constantly visualizing it day and night to keep him going. Here is a glimpse: [https://youtu.be/u\_ktRTWMX3M?si=7v3g04YxVIb44gs-&t=141](https://youtu.be/u_ktRTWMX3M?si=7v3g04YxVIb44gs-&t=141).

I would not quite call his mentality one of subtle aspiration. He really does emphasize that he keeps the goal constantly in mind, and in some ways that he *craves* it. However, he's been able to use his hyper-intensive goal-focused mentality to achieve many things in his life, from bodybuilding, to acting, to becoming a politician, all at the highest levels, coming from a humble background. 

As I'm sure many of you know, the downside of ""craving"" in Buddhism is associated with the crash one experiences if one does not achieve the goal. The more one craves, the more one experiences aversion to a scenario where one doesn't get the object of one's craving (in theory).

After learning about Bhava-tanha, part of me always tries to tone it down whenever I get overly excited about achieving something. But I question sometimes whether this excitement is a bad thing - it is damn helpful for motivation to be hyper-goal focused. And I believe it might be possible to be filled with desire for something, which creates a lot of energy, but then quickly move on if the object of one's desire doesn't come to fruition, vs. being overcome with suffering. I think there are upsides to this strong feeling of desire that outweigh the downsides.

But I find that studying Buddhism can sometimes lead to trying to cut down feelings of desire at their root. While well-intentioned, I feel this mentality may be doing more harm than good, because most of us won't achieve enlightenment in this lifetime and would be more than happy with a life like the one Arnold has created for himself. Yes, he may not be enlightened, but he has done a lot of good in the world and inspired many to live healthy, fulfilling lives. If Arnold got really into Buddhism when he was young, what kind of life would he have had?

So this is just some food for thought and maybe it will engender some discussion. I'm familiar with Tantric philosophy and the ability to transmute desire into wisdom energy. But in the earlier stages of the Mahayana path, the focus is on gaining control of and reducing desire first.",Buddhism,1704201376.0,t3_18wp6yg,1.0,10

Losing faith in buddhism,"Hello my friends- within like the past hour, i've genuinely lost at least a significant amount of faith in buddhism. And whilst it is likely that i will regain my faith and/or that i will go to sleep and wake up with at least some amount of my former faith restored, i suppose it's still good to make this post because I do need advice regarding my situation.

Within like the past hour, i've looked through material regarding buddhism- things regarding Tantric sex and misogony in buddhism. The sultras contain mysoginistic rhetoric. But i don't know man, the way there is an obvious power inbalance in instances when tantric sex is practised between a lama/guru/master and consort, the many cases of lamas- people supposed to have progressed down the spiritual path further than us, doing horrible things sexually with abuse of power, sexual assault and what not. And the way some buddhism still teaches that women can only obtain enlightenment in the form of a man. I know that all these can have logical explanations- the sultras were written long after Buddha's death and hence, the misogony could be later additions and lamas are too human and can be ignorant and do things that they shouldn't. But buddhism is kinda starting to feel empty, which is ironic given that emptiness is a key buddhist teaching.

I really don't know. And i do know that a lot of what i've described (tantric sex and lamas) is mostly tibetan buddhism, but i'm losing faith in buddhism in general.

Is sometimes being put in a position to get bad karma because of your own bad karma?,"Let's say you're in a position to stop someone murdering an innocent, and thus you will kill the person preemptively

You have to pick between letting an innocent die (bad karma?) and protecting them (good karma).

You have to pick between murdering the murderer beforehand (bad karma) or not murdering them (good karma).

Stopping Reincarnation An Prompts For Meditation.,"As someone that is trying to start on the path of Siddhartha Gautama, I must say that being alive and continuing life in morality, good health and happiness is the point of life in every other religion I am aware of, and therefore Buddhist teaching seems to conflict with them *all* on their main assertion. I believe in Gods, Spirits, Ancestors, and I want to worship all of them. They all say to stay alive, be moral, and continue the family line. They have given me courage, love, comfort and sustenance across my life, though for most of it I didn't know it. They have never given up on me. I want to submit to their will for the rest of my days, and nothing will pry them from me, so I'm looking to mix my religion with whatever I can from Buddhism, but obviously I can't do it fully, please forgive my ignorance and implied arrogance. I understand many Chinese people do the same thing, so it can't be that bad, right? i would appreciate any advice on this point.

I love everything else I've learned about Buddhism so far, which admittedly isn't much, a religion that essentially functions as a science and a store of wisdom is incredibly appealing to a Westerner who comes from a 100% Dogma based religion and an Aristotelian intellectual path. I particularly love the tradition of meditating on prompts, I once did something similar and came out with some cool ideas, so I know it works, despite the complaints I've heard from ignorant Westerners.

For instance here are two:

The first law of thermodynamics states that it is impossible for energy to be created or destroyed in a closed system (and all existence is a closed system), and cause and effect (not the principle of causality, but the colloquial idea that things that happen require other things to have happened in order to cause them) exist simultaneously in a cyclical or infinitely regressing universe.

(The next is in thought)

Ponder.

Together they would have created a mind capable of controlling the entire universe (something we could call at least one God) given infinite repetition. There is no evidence for such a mind in the material universe, therefore the cycle or regress is not infinite, and the universe was created (by at least one mind we could call a God), and if that didn't happen, then to change the nature of both stable, eternal natures, there must have been a choice to join them, as they haven't been together long enough to make a God in this universe yet. Cause and effect and energy were joined by choice by at least one mind capable of controlling at least two universes (Or something we could call a God). There is a God. Atheism hasn't made sense since I discovered this intuitive argument years ago.

After that the next meditation:

Given Zeno's Dichotomy (The notion that moving toward an object is impossible because the time spent to get to it can be divided infinitely, even below planck time) simultaneously existing with the fact that matter must have a minimum unit in order to be said to exist, even below planck length. 

Ponder.

Time must have a minimum unit (later I found out that this has been thought of already, it's called a chronon), and so must everything else in order to be said to exist.

Cause and effect (and therefore logic itself) crossed into this universe at the great ordering I described in the last meditation description. Therefore, some must have come in first. Therefore, logic has a minimum unit, or something I call a Thales. Thales can be said to be present in the macro and less focused in the micro, after all in the macro world logic operates on laws that are universal, but at the quantum level they don't hold true, therefore two things that contradict are true in the same sense at once. In other words the law of non-contradiction is not native to this universe, this universe is one of of complete chaos and illogic without the joining.

Can I get Buddhist thoughts to meditate on? I would really appreciate it.",Buddhism,1704160541.0,t3_18wdd6w,0.5,0

"buddhism isn't about truth, it's about the ending of suffering","happy new year 2024! 

one realization i had this year was: buddhism isn't really about truth, it's about the end of suffering.

the entire system is built from the ground up to end suffering for all beings, resting on this goal as its foundation.

the truth is also important, but at some point, it becomes irrelevant. fundamental reality is found to be ineffable *(too great or extreme to be expressed or described in words)*, partly because we just don't have the mental power to understand it. 

hope you have an excellent 365 days ahead.

EDIT: Many threads are arguing that truth is important. Famously, there are 2 truths in Buddhism. Conventional truth which includes scientific knowledge is not necessary, but can be helpful. absolute truth is definitely more important to know. I am not sure whether it is important to know everything about absolute truth... in fact, I am not sure if it is even possible to know absolute truth fully, or whether knowledge is a category that can even survive in the face of absolute truth. If anyone does have scriptural insight into this, I would love to know.

"Zen, and understanding 'no self' through community bonds and intimacy?","So I‚Äôm slowly getting back into my practice in a deliberate way that is unlike how I have engaged with it before. I follow mostly Zen (Mahayana) and feel that much of it speaks to me and I‚Äôm truly excited to continue re-engaging with it.

However I am not finding much on how Zen engages with the concept of intimacy and community. This is sort of difficult to articulate, but from my perspective, a good amount of Zen practice is based on internal contemplation, and where other sentient beings are involved, they are seen as opportunities to be part of the practice of contemplation.

I recognize that this is a very crude summation, but while that approach does speak to me, I am curious if Mahayana/Zen teachings have a more defined conceptualization of sentient beings in the way of talking about bonds, intimacy, community, parts of one, etc? Typing this out now, I want to say the answer is no because the teachings would argue that it would go down the path of attachments and creating karmic energy that would be the result of those interactions.

But while I am grateful for the lessons Zen has provided so far, I feel that looking at other sentient beings, particularly humans, as solely opportunities to practice misses out on an opportunity to understand ‚Äòno self‚Äô through communion with others. Again, not sure if I‚Äôm articulating this well, but I would love to have any words and thoughts around this as I think about this more.

Do you still get ‚Äúbad‚Äù karma if you thought you were doing something good ?,"If someone did something that was atrociously bad. Like for example, what if they were a n*zi in Germany in ww2 but they were brain washed into truly believing what they were doing was a good service to the world and that they were truly ‚Äúridding the world of evil‚Äù. Would they still be receiving negative karma ? Or would it be more neutral, per the law of emptiness, and that it isn‚Äôt up to us how the rest of the world PERCEIVES our actions since they are empty of a nature, and it only matters how WE perceive our actions? And that we can actively choose to see the neutrality of all our actions? 

So in that case is it less about the literal things you do and more about how you think about those things? Like if you do something without any feelings of guilt or shame at any point and you actually feel like you just did a good thing even if it was ‚Äúbad‚Äù in the eyes of others, would it have good/neutral rippled effects for YOU since you‚Äôre the experiencer?

"Book review - Rebirth: A Guide to Mind, Karma, and Cosmos in the Buddhist World","*Book author: Roger R. Jackson*  
*Publication date and publisher: 2022, Shambhala*

I stumbled upon this book some weeks ago. The publisher describes it as the first-ever guide to rebirth in Buddhism in which the history and scope of Buddhist approaches to this belief are treated systematically, and Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse, Jos√© Cabezon, Jay Garfield, among others, have written endorsements for it, so I thought that it might be a good handy guide to quote from and to refer people to when everyone's most favorite question pops up in the sub, and gave it a read.

First, some background regarding the book should be mentioned briefly. I'm not familiar with the writer Roger R. Jackson but he's ""Professor Emeritus of Asian Studies and Religion at Carleton College. He has nearly 50 years of experience with the study and practice of Buddhism, particularly in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition ... Roger is a highly respected and beloved scholar, Dharma teacher, and writer. He has authored many scholarly books and articles, and is a frequent contributor to Lion‚Äôs Roar, Buddhadharma, and Tricycle magazines.""

The author's credentials are solid enough, and he's done a pretty good job surveying the landscape of rebirth teachings. However, as he explains in the epilogue, his own position regarding rebirth is agnostic, predicated on behaving ""as if"" rebirth is true. So if you had hoped that the book would also include some novel defenses of rebirth teachings, that isn't the case. But I thought that other than being too lenient on modernist ideas of Buddhism, the author handles the subject fairly, and is interested in presenting the teachings clearly rather than judging them or arguing for/against.

This is a somewhat deceptive book, in a way, because although you might go in expecting information just about rebirth, you will actually get a few summaries of Buddhist history and doctrines. There's even a brief overview of non-Indian ideas of rebirth, which I found fascinating. At times, the book reads like a digest version of Williams' Mahayana Buddhism (to which it is clearly indebted). By presenting these teachings and summarizing them, it provides the context onto which karma and so on fit, and can serve to dispel received ideas such as how Zen doesn't believe in these things. This is excellent news for various sorts of beginners, or Buddhists who didn't learn much about traditions other than theirs, but for others it might feel as if the space taken up by this information could have been used for deeper discussion on rebirth and karma.

One of the best parts in the book is the survey of Indian ideas on rebirth. Jackson demonstrates clearly that these ideas were by no means normative (or ancestral) at the time, that the Buddha placed rebirth and karma at the front and center of his teaching, and that, far from repeating popular beliefs, he contributed enormously to systematic and detailed understandings of karma and rebirth while providing his distinct version. The author even analyzes and refutes the two strategies of denials used to distort the Buddha‚Äôs views.

The structure of the book is as follows: after a survey of Indian and non-Indian concepts of rebirth, we move on to an analysis of the Buddha‚Äôs teachings on the matter. After this comes the ‚Äúwhere‚Äù (six realms), ‚Äúhow‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of rebirth. This is followed by a survey of Indian Mahayana views as well as a summary of Indian Buddhist arguments for rebirth, with a focus on Dharmakƒ´rti‚Äôs defense, because the author wrote a paper on this as a student. After this comes a discussion of Theravada, East Asian, Inner Asian, and modern views of rebirth. The first three, as well as the parts on early Buddhism and Mahayana, also include a discussion of views on female birth and the status of women in each zone considered. Finally, there‚Äôs a survey of contemporary debates and ideas, concluding with the author‚Äôs own view.

A great deal of issues, including perennial questions such as ‚Äúhow can there be rebirth without a self‚Äù, are touched upon in these parts. Overall, the book is educative, easy to follow, and pretty wide in scope, designed to be read and digested easily by a large public, Buddhist or not. But for that reason, those wishing for a heavy scholarly discussion of these subjects will have to wait.

One criticism I'll make is that Pali discourses are cited a lot when ‚Äúearly‚Äù views are discussed, because the author strangely conceives of the Theravada as being the same as Sthaviravada, due to the two words meaning the same thing, even though this is not accepted by scholarship (e.g. by Bhikkhu Sujato). More problematically, the Pali Canon is considered to have been closed around 2000 years ago, but to my knowledge, this is not definitely established. The existence of the Agamas is alluded to, but they are never referenced, and this is disappointing especially in light of how the ‚ÄúKalama Sutta‚Äù is briefly looked at later. I also felt that an important omission from the discussion is the ‚Äúphysical space‚Äù in which rebirth takes place. The discussion on the six realms doesn‚Äôt touch much on the spatial and temporal cosmology of Buddhism, even though questions on these aspects feed every facet of modern discussions on rebirth: it‚Äôs confusing to some, a reason for criticism or a source of positive arguments for others, and a point of comparison with scientific theories for yet others. Since the book is very much not strictly about the teaching of rebirth, it would have been interesting to read something on this matter as well.

Overall, a pretty helpful book for beginners, for Buddhists who are in denial of what their traditions actually accept, and for Buddhists who want a concise reference for doctrines surrounding rebirth and karma.",Buddhism,1704115418.0,t3_18vwomu,0.9,16
How do I let go of the anger? Found out that the man I have dated (and broken up with) was lying and cheating all along.,"Sorry for the long post ahead.

I was dating this man who claimed to have just broken up with his ‚Äúex‚Äù. I couldn‚Äôt really trust him and there were signs of his ‚Äúex‚Äù still in his life so I ended things after a while.

Few months later we reconnected and this time started dating more seriouslyx, thinking he and his ‚Äúex‚Äù have been completely cut off.

Again I‚Äôve had my suspicions and still couldn‚Äôt trust him and for the longest time I kept thinking it‚Äôs just my past trauma and it‚Äôs just me being overly paranoid.

Well I finally ended things with him in early December because I found out he booked a trip without letting me know, thought that was very sketchy. And just last week I found that he was traveling with his ‚Äúex‚Äù. Upon more digging I found out they were never broken up - he was lying and cheating on her the whole time.

I messaged the girlfriend to let her know of his cheating, she confronted him (and he even denied it!) I then blocked both of them and tried to move on.

It should have been enough but I find myself still waking up angry and unable to relax - I think I‚Äôm mostly angry at him (who lied and showed no respect for me, despite all the time I‚Äôve questioned him and he gave all sorts of excuses), but I‚Äôm also angry at myself (that I have my suspicions, forced myself to ‚Äútake a leap of faith‚Äù and to work on my trust issues, only to end up betrayed again). I also find myself obsessing over the details and trying to ‚Äúdebunks‚Äù each lies .

I recognize that I haven‚Äôt been so attached to him and I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm hurt, but angry. 

Obviously I know confronting him wouldn‚Äôt work and he wouldn‚Äôt be able to give me closure - he is a liar after all - but how do I get over the anger?

Ten years of Buddhism.,"While writing another comment I suddenly realised that yesterday marks ten years since I first practiced Buddhism.

I was having a rough time of it in college and heard that this meditation thing was good for reducing stress, anxiety, depression. So I did what any good redditor would do and hopped on /r/Meditation to learn more about it. From there I was linked to /r/Buddhism and I started reading *Mindfulness in Plain English*. It has four chapters and on Dec 28 I decided that I would read one per day, before putting it into action on New Years Day. Well, by Dec 30 I was so excited by the first half that I threw out my timeline and decided to get right to it. A few days later I discovered the Four Noble Truths and knew instantly that they were correct and that this was the path for me. I know that I'm rather impulsive by nature so I (unusually prudently) decided to give it a 1 year trial period before committing fully.

Ten years later, what can I say? I'm still alive and practicing with hope and confidence. Thanks in large part to this subreddit and the many people who have been inflicted with my presence (on several accounts) over the past ten years.

Can you get bad karma for taking inheritance from a parent who doesn't want to give it?,"Hey, so two years ago, my dad had this huge fight with my half-siblings. They moved out and didn't bother visiting him, even when he was in the hospital. Basically, they disowned him. I stepped in, moved in with him, and took care of him since then. I could see how upset and disappointed he was with my half-siblings. Sometimes, I'd catch him secretly crying.

He'd tell me how disappointed he was with my half-siblings and he conveyed his strong reluctance for my half-siblings to inherit his wealth. It kinda sucks because they're living the good life‚Äîgreat education, awesome careers‚Äîall thanks to my dad. He was always being super thrifty, even if it meant he had to skip meals, just to make sure we had good lives. He'd rather starve than let his kids go hungry.

He'd always remind me not to let them near his funeral if something happened to him and insisted that all his wealth had to go to me. I told him it wasn't up to me; he needed to put it in his will. But, well, he didn't, and he passed away suddenly. I did end up inheriting some money and properties, but I'm thinking of giving them up because my half-siblings are constantly pressuring me and threatening to sue. Some might think I'm dumb, but I just want a chill life, and I reckon earning my own keep is more meaningful. I've taken a bit of money to do some charity stuff on behalf of my dad.

Wondering, how does Buddhism see this kind of situation? Will my half-siblings get some karma for inheriting my dad's wealth when he wasn't cool with it? I feel it's unfair to my dad considering how they treated him, but I don't want to get into a full-blown fight with them. I just want my peace and let karma sort them out.

Why Believe in Karma and Reincarnation?,"So for the last few years I've been interested in Buddhism but whenever I try getting into it the idea of karma or reincarnation always put me off. I know they're inseparable from Buddhism so I definitely couldn't call myself a Buddhist if I don't believe in them and I don't think I'm ever going to start believing in them.  
So what I wanted to ask to anyone who's converted to Buddhism is why you believe in karma and reincarnation? To me living life just one time and following the barest rules of conduct feels like too much work so the idea of living hundreds of thousands of lives until you eventually end up living a good enough life to escape the cycle seems a lot worse than just not believing in anything. And a big part of why I got into spiritual stuff is because it makes me feel more at peace so having something so upsetting be part of a major religion seems strange to me.  
Almost everything else I've heard to do with Buddhism apart from the karma and reincarnation stuff is great.

So is there a mention of this in any buddhist scripture or sutta and also is there cure for this in the buddhist meditation techniques??

The Anti-New Years Resolution Toast to fellow Buddha's,"Here is a toast to those who gave up in achieving and found liberation in being:

To those who abandoned the pursuit of external validation and embraced the beauty of their own existence. To those who surrendered the relentless chase after achievements and discovered the profound satisfaction of simply being.

To those who shed the shackles of ambition and embraced the freedom of authenticity. To those who silenced the inner critic and allowed their true selves to shine.

To those who found solace in the present moment and relinquished the burden of constantly striving for a future that may never arrive. To those who embraced the serenity of letting go and surrendered to the flow of life.

1-I¬¥ve read the Lotus Sutra, the part about skillful means and everybody being a (potential) Buddha and all, but that doesn¬¥t strike me as uber-revolutionary. Maybe it was when it was first declared?

End of the Calendar Year. Memories,"Dear Buddhist monks, laymans and practicioners.


As we approach the end of the year, I find myself contemplating the teachings I've encountered living in the present moment. The emphasis on the now, without dwelling on the past or future, is a recurring theme in books, dharma talks, and Buddha's quotes.

Yet, as a novice in my Buddhist practice, I grapple with this notion. Reflecting on the past year doesn't seem harmful; in fact, it conjures both pleasant and painful memories. It's a natural inclination for us humans.

Recalling past experiences can be emotionally challenging, given how our thoughts and experiences shape us. The photographs on our walls capture moments with loved ones, both joyful and challenging. We hold onto these images not to live in the past but to honor and remember what has shaped us.

While it's acknowledged that living in the past is counterproductive, many of us find solace in nostalgic recollections. Personally, closing my eyes can transport me to moments with my late mother, evoking both sadness and happiness simultaneously.

I'm curious about your perspective on this. Is revisiting old memories occasionally truly detrimental, or can it serve a purpose in our spiritual journey?",Buddhism,1704033718.0,t3_18v93iz,0.57,1

Ignoring My Calling and Fearing Naraka,"I've seen many discussions come and go on this subreddit. One of them happens to be about the Buddhist Hell, Naraka. For some reason, when I read of Naraka outside of Buddhist teachings, they talk about it metaphorically. When looking at the discussions on this subreddit and doing my own research, it seems that Naraka is *very* real.

I've had a thought in my mind about Naraka for a long time. I imagined a place where I would go through all of infinity as my ego. I would live through every actual ***and*** potential reality, but I would stay as my ego. I also had the thought that it wasn't never ending, but if I experience everything through my ego, it might as well be.

I've definitely done righteous things in my life but I've also done so much wrong. I'm addicted to alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine. I've also been ignoring my calling to join a Monastery and become a Buddhist. I feel like I will go to this Naraka if I continue to ignore it.

I'm scared I will be rejected from Monasteries due to having psychosis in the past. I'm also desperately trying to tell myself that it's not real. The cycle continues to tear at my soul.

I go back and forth between believing this Hell and not believing it. Some days, I tell myself it's ok. I'll be fine for a week before the thought comes back. I just wish I could wish it all away.

TLDR; I know my calling and I fear Naraka is in my future if I continue to ignore it. I'm scared I will be rejected from Monasteries due to psychosis. Sometimes, I don't even believe in it anymore and I get confused. What do I do?",Buddhism,1704031278.0,t3_18v8d3v,0.4,0

Suicide in Buddhism,"Ever thought of suicide? Think suicide can ""end all my sufferings""? Let us think again and view into what Buddhism have taught upon suicide and suffering.

In the [Sutta Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta: Setting the Wheel of Dhamma in Motion](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn56/sn56.011.than.html), it is said:

>""Now this, monks, is the noble truth of stress: Birth is stressful, aging is stressful, **death is stressful**; sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, & despair are stressful; association with the unbeloved is stressful, separation from the loved is stressful, not getting what is wanted is stressful. In short, the five clinging-aggregates are stressful.

Death is a process of suffering, by suiciding you are just dying and suffering more. Then, to say that ""all my sufferings will be ended when I suicide"" is a wrong view. Why so? This is due to a simple reason, Buddhism believe in infinite life rebirth, not ""YOLO (You Only Live Once)"", by being attached to YOLO and thinking suffering ends after death is not in accordance to the right view of the Dhamma, that is the wrong view, not in accordance with Noble Eightfold Path.

Furthermore, since Infinite Life is a concept, it is known that the next rebirth is highly dependant on your last thought before death and your karma. Since the last thought of death is practically full of suffering, pain, regret, fear, anger, the next rebirth is highly likely to be in the three lower realms, where the amount of suffering is WAYYYY worse.

Thinking that you can get to Pure Land via rebirth? That would not work in my opinion, why so? Pure Land requires you to have good roots and merits, to practice the Dharma and uphold precepts.

The Contemplation Sutra on Amitayus say;

>There are three other kinds of sentient beings who also attain birth. Who are the three \[other kinds of sentient beings\]? They are, first, **those who have a compassionate heart, abstain from killing, and observe the precepts;** second, those who chant the Mahayana sutras of greater scope; and third, those who practice the six forms of mindfulness. They aspire to be born in that buddha land by transferring there the merit of practice.

By commiting suicide, you are killing yourself, that breaks the first precept. By killing yourself, you have no compassion towards yourself and others, why? Since you kill yourself, you do not feel compassion for your own body, you caused others to feel afflicted due to your death, creating more bad karma.

Although there are moral debate on suicide for those who are in extreme pain, that is for the professionals to decide, however, we layperson who are in normal suffering, that does not result in severe medical conditions (and has not been approved by any professionals), should avoid any forms of suicide as it will bring the most harm one can think of.

# What to do when I am suffering?

Practice Dharma, practice Metta, practice Noble Eightfold Path. The Buddha has laid down teachings to help us get on path and be happy for this life. One can do meditation, or even chanting Buddhas name, or finding virtuous sangha community friends. Remember, we are all on the path to be liberation of suffering and we will help eachother in need, so do not suicide!

If you, are having such thoughts, and want to find a community of virtuous friends to talk to, you are highly recommended to join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nnyYVEga), anyone else can join too! If you are thinking of suicide, please call the suicide hotline and get advice.

Life/health changes as an opportunity to learn non-attachment,"I've recently developed a health condition that includes chronic pain and lots of diet restrictions. I was vegan already so it's cut down my diet when I didn't have much wiggle room to begin with.

This all started within the past 5 months or so. One day I was a healthy young adult and the next day I started having different symptoms. I never realized how much I took for granted being healthy, young, and having my body just ""work.""

I recently got a new therapist. I'm going to start doing some DBT with her and RAIN practices from Tara Brach. I want to use this as an opportunity to find refuge in my Buddhist practice as well. I figure my only options are to either be upset and neurotic about it or try to use it in a positive way. I've got a lot of anger, sadness, and loss right now. I keep thinking about when I was healthy and didn't know that soon everything would become a lot harder. I wish I would've appreciated what I had then.

But then I started thinking about it more. I felt like everything was unfair because I ""shouldn't"" be unhealthy. As soon as I thought that, I remembered that this is samsara; suffering is to be expected. This is ""normal"" for samsara. I'm still struggling a lot, but having that thought made things a bit easier to accept. I'm not owed anything, least of all a healthy body. There's nothing to fight against because this isn't out of the ordinary.

I'm going to have to switch to mostly making things from scratch with not that much flavor. I'm also going to try cutting out sugar too. Besides that, this severely impacts my sex life; I haven't been intimate with my partner or masturbated in months. Losing those sources of pleasure and indulgence has been extremely difficult. It's also made me realize how much I relied on such things to find happiness.

I'm not sure if or when I will get better. I want to develop a practice so that whether I do or not, I will be okay.

How important is to find purpose at young age and be consistent with it ?,"




I feel ashamed like being in mid20s but haven't worked for over a year feeling stuck and confused then ever before. I don't know what to do. This year is already ended and new year will being but I still haven't figured out a plan for a new beginning. I definitely want to improve and make a change but keep that consistent flowing. This year didn't go well and I just felt like I'm living in this rut. 
I only worked so far in fast food and retail jobs. It was okay I guess. I didn't enjoy it or felt like I'm learning anything new to leverage for better opportunities. I didn't take classes consistently this year because whatever I plan to study is giving the fear of Ai taking over someday. Then I have no backup plan to depend on. I don't mind getting job but it feels like I'm repeating history once again with no direction for the future. Lately for few months have lost enthusiasm in life because I feel non deserving and like constantly worried about life and my future.

Losing your Awakening,"Let me start by saying that I know that there are tons of claims of awakening coming from people who claim to have got there through drugs, new age spirituality, people who misrepresent Buddhism, or don't care to study it, and therefore claims of awakening are annoying and funny sometimes. Now I'm not claiming to have attained arhatship, or even stream entry, no. But I do know that I experienced some form of piti and jhana, which started around 3-4 months of meditation and studying.  


This all happened \~3 years ago. I had no meditation experience at that time, and had tried it 1-2 times before, and found it stupid. I was going through the darkest period in my life (although I've been dealing with lifelong depression this period was super dark) where I had started thinking of my depression in a more metaphysical/spiritual sense, thinking stuff like ""My heart is sealed"", ""My life is a trap and I'm imprisoned in it"" and etc. I'm not sure if these thoughts sprung out in my mind after a bad acid trip (yes, I know, another guy with acid story. But I used to do it maybe once a year max, and didn't experience anything other than bad trips. So, I'm not claiming any acid enlightenment). Me experience had until then been of trauma, anxiety, depression, and a sense of losing all capacity to feel anything, almost like my brain slowly dying.  


Anyway, somehow I started reading about things I hadn't before. First I started reading about Castaneda, then somehow came across Bardo Thodol, and listened to it before going to sleep. These things all happened maybe within a week. Then one day again I was looking for answers and came across this book called  **The Mindful Way through Depression** (John Kabaat Zinn) and read 2-3 chapters from it and suddenly things clicked for me. I got this vivid and clear understanding that thoughts were not of the huge importance that I had until then given them and that if they were, they would have helped me in some way or the other in the last 26-27 years that I had them. I don't remember everything and the whole realization I had, and even if I did I bet it would be hard to put it in words.  


I tried meditating as prescribed in the book (classic breath meditation) and felt something. Concentration, some pleasure and etc. Then I meditated again maybe 30 mins after the first one. I meditated for 20 mins (2nd time meditating in my life) and experienced an explosion of joy and sense of freedom. My whole brain awakened from the sleep of depression and it was so intense that I stopped meditating. After that I had this lingering feeling (it feels like someone is squeezing your head) that I used to get when doing acid that lasted for multiple hours.  


This started a period in my life of daily meditation and learning from teachers on youtube. I was mainly identifying with Yuttadhammo Bhikku whose videos I was learning a lot from. I was chasing after that feeling of rapture, and I guess my meditation suffered because of it (as I thought a good meditation was what I felt that first time). Despite that I kept meditating for an hour a day or maybe more sometimes, and also being mindful while walking, doing dishes etc.   


As my mind got much clearer, sharper, and focused, I managed to start a career in programming. I wanted to become an urban monk, who works to support himself but dedicates the rest of his time meditating. But alas, that didn't work. Programming, analytical thinking, interaction with people it all distracted me from my meditation and Buddhism.  


It's been 3 years now, and I have made some attempts to go back to meditating, but stopped shortly after. In a way I'm still comparing my meditations to that first time of explosion of joy, and it kind of hinders me. Now I'm back drowning in depression, and in danger of losing my job because of how depressed I am. That first time I had found The Buddha in the purest way - because I wanted to escape suffering.   


I don't know what my question is or why I wrote this. I feel like I lost my awakening partly because I wasn't a part of a sangha, and was left alone with my practice with no guidance or support. Maybe I want to know if anyone had any similar experience of being awakened and losing it later. Or maybe advice on how to get that passion, that feeling of urgency and maybe fear to get back to meditation. I swear, around 2 months ago I had this dream that I was 60 years old and I was scared that I wasted my whole life and didn't follow the Buddha's path. But I'm in the slumber of the depressed mind which lulls you into a sleep. ",Buddhism,1703982014.0,t3_18uu86y,0.9,17

New Person - Trying to find a center in Syracuse NY,"Hi.  I know very little about Buddhism and I'm looking to find out more in the Syracuse NY or Central NY area.  

I live in the Syracuse NY area and only found a couple places.  The first I talked to was a Zen Buddhist temple in the suburbs.  I know even less about Zen.  My impressions was the place was for a upper middle class, well off clientele.  Most people were professionals, similar ethnic and socioeconomic background.  Nice, but there was an air of, don't know how to describe it, entitled - monied.  

People were kind of dismissive about basic information, maybe it was just who I talked to.  There website states they want you to tithe 10% of your annual income to them.  I don't mind making donations, but they also charge for 'classes'.  I never heard of this kind of request from friends who long time Buddhists.  Not judging, just took a mental note - the interactions left a less than enthusiastic vibe - so I guess this isn't the place for me.  

I am financially well off, but I find emphasis on money and spirituality don't mix well.  I got sober many decades ago, suffer from depression and anxiety (money hasn't helped much in the mental health dept).  I just want to find some peace even if it comes to doing things online vs in person.

Liberation & Thoughts/Beliefs,"The further *I* head into realisations along the path, the more it becomes apparent that a lot of awakening/liberation pertains to disidentifying with thought, and subsequently dissolving beliefs‚Äìbeliefs are ultimately just another thought that is disguised as something else and largely hidden from consciousness. It has become clear that the quantity or potency of beliefs that someone has about themselves and the world, is inversely correlated with the freedom from suffering.

Some notable beliefs that many people have while being largely unconscious and wrapped up in egoic mind patterns and existence include;

\- I am here and the world is out there- I am separate from the senses

\- Time and distance exist as a thing

\- One side cannot be both sides

\- It's important to have strong beliefs about things because it makes me human and strong

There are obviously many more, and obviously not all beliefs crucially need investigating. For example, thinking that it's important to floss in the morning as a belief.

The phrase 'If you meet the Buddha on the road, slay the Buddha' directly points to the notion of dissolving beliefs. It's an important reminder that the Buddha pointed beyond himself, beyond Buddhism, and beyond all doctrine.",Buddhism,1703942067.0,t3_18ufegi,0.5,0

[PERSONAL OPINION] How Karma and Rebirth cannot be seperated and must be accepted together.,"# Ever thought why you're borned the way you are? 

Ever thought why some people are borned rich, some are born poor, some are born in a specific country, some are born in a new continent, some are born smart, some are born 'silly'?  


People always say ""This is a test from xxx, life is YOLO"", I personally disagree. It is weird that if life is 'YOLO (you only live once)', then it is unfair that everyone is so uniquely different and unfairly 'created'.

Why are people in the poorer countries suffering while people in rich nations are enjoying life?

&#x200B;

Such 'unfairness' just cannot answer and logically prove 'YOLO'. Hence comes the rebirth doctrine.

> **Rebirth** in [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism) refers to the teaching that the actions of a sentient being lead to a new existence after death, in an endless cycle called [*sa·πÉsƒÅra*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra). 

In all schools of Buddhism, rebirth is accepted as a core belief. In Buddhism, we believe there is infinite life before us, and after us, where we will be reborn in the [six realms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Paths), unless we are liberated from [samsara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra) (which is what most Buddhist is aiming for). Rebirth works logically, when one create a [Karma (kamma)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma_in_Buddhism) in this life, last life, it will 'consolidate' together and with the aid of the last thought in life before death, will result in the reborn of one in next life. (Read Mindfulness of Death, [MOD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/18246rr/mindfulness_of_death_mod/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3))

The three miserable realms are full of suffering and the three upper realms although suffer less, is still filled with suffering. This suffering will repeat continously until one finally get liberated from samsara.

However, due to everyone's unique karma, they are reborn in different type of places and classes. This makes sense.   

**The King of Concentrations Sutra says:** 

>**You will obtain a result similar To the kinds of karma you do.** 

This will lead you to your next rebirth, and you get the fruit you planted one day. This explains why rebirth and karma cannot be mutually exclusive. To reject rebirth, is the same as rejecting karma, to reject karma is the same as rejecting rebirth. To claim rebirth is non evidental is to claim karma is non evidental, and the vice versa. It is a wrong view to make such claims.

It is also silly to reject rebirth or karma concept because it does not fit to your own belief, remember the Second nobles truth states we are suffering because of our ignorance to Dharma. Instead of strongly rejecting, refuting karma and rebirth, we should look at how we can make our life better. If we are poor, if we are sad, then let us find ways to make it better, plant more good karma seed and let it ripe, **PRACTICING THE DHARMA** and the Noble Eightfold Path is the way to help us have better karmic seeds.

Just because we have a bad life should not mean that we reject karma and rebirth, we should look for ways to make life better, not to develop ego and say rebirth and karma is wrong.

This is a personal opinion and my own takeaway from Karma and Rebirth, of course there is more to karma but it is how it is linked to rebirth. Buddhist doctrines are interlinked, we should not seperate them and make them an independent identity and argue the heck out of it.

Please correct me if there is any wrong ideas in my opinion.

What is some advice you could give about dealing with being hated and considered a fool?,"I have a lot of bullies who jeer at me and ridicule me mercilessly, even though I keep to myself. Yesterday, someone called me something that wasn't even true, but the gall and the hatred of the person stuck with me like time delayed poison. I didn't retaliate, but as soon as I got home I stewed in anger for hours and felt ill. I think of the metaphor of someone with an arrow in their back being grateful for that and how it's a blessing in disguise. But at times I feel more arrow than human.

Would it be considered disrespectful to write a poem from the perspective of Tara,"Hello everyone :)

Yesterday, a strange thing happened. I was working on a poem but i was also browsing information about Tara, Green Tara meditation etc. But then it was almost like Tara herself or her energy had enterend the space or I had someway felt her energy. I can't explain the feeling but there was joy and probably some sort of sense of peace. I smiled in a sort of joyful yet gentle way, the type of smile on perhaps a buddha statue or on a depiction of Tara. And a part of me kinda started to view the poem i had been working on as comforting words coming from Tara or something of the sort.

Should I continue the poem from Tara's perspective? and would that be considered disrespectful? I'm genuinely unsure because I mean no disrespect or mockery towards Tara- in fact, her energy is beautiful to me.

&#x200B;

Edit: I emailed  **Dhamma Sukha Meditation Center about this and asked for consultation from a master or teacher and this was their response:**

""Our opinion would be this was more about faith and joy arising about something. Not a meditation insight or realization. This comes from the letting go of tanha or craving in some way.""

books for a newer buddhist?,"i've been loosely into buddhism for 2-3 years now, maybe 4. buddhism has always resonated with me more than anything else, though i've never dove into it deeply. i've been between it, atheism, and agnosticism for quite a while. i want to learn and try my best to apply buddhism to my life, especially with this upcoming year. i am mostly asking for books i could learn from, specifically beginner level as i know there is a lot of depth to buddhism. i want to learn about siddharta, goals and achievements of buddhism, the gods, living as buddhist, etc. if you all have any book recommendations, that would be nice . :) if it helps, i am more casual than traditionalist - though i would enjoy learning about tradition, i am not as strict now as i may be later in life.

Is it ok to be ok with not achieving enlightenment in this lifetime?,"For all of us, the goal is to eventually achieve spiritual liberation. But for most of us, most of us don‚Äôt see ourselves becoming fully enlightened Arhats (Theravada) or fully enlightened Buddhas (Mahayana) in this lifetime alone. It got me thinking, why am I a Buddhist if I don‚Äôt have the specific goal to become awakened in this lifetime? And I think it‚Äôs because honestly, the Buddhist teachings just resonate with me. 
It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt want to be an arhat or a Buddha in this lifetime, it‚Äôs just I don‚Äôt see it happening. As far as I can tell I have a lot of work before attaining stream entry at the very least. I can see myself making that a reasonable goal for myself at the end of this life time-to attain stream entry, and maybe a higher level of realization if I become a monk.

I think at the end of the day, it‚Äôs about having a goal to work on. Something to keep us going, and something to give us answers in this difficult world of samsara that we live in, and to hopefully, eventually reach the end of the path to liberation.

Coming to Terms with Who We Truly Are,"Since getting serious about meditation and following the teachings of the Buddha, I've come to realize that I have some flawed character traits that need work. Before this, I was pretty much blind to these flaws; I didn't think I was perfect by any means, but I definitely didn't see things the way I do now. I now see the subtle ways in which I hurt myself and/or others around me, and I'm genuinely working on fixing that now. It's so different with Buddhism though, because I also feel like there's nothing to ""fix""; I just need to get more in tune with my innate goodness and it will all flow the way it should. 

It's different than how I used to practice in the Christian church. Not only did I not see all my flaws, but for the ones that I did notice, I would just beat myself up about them all the time, and I'd never get better. It's like I lived in a constant state of guilt with no way out. Now, thankfully, things are different. I don't feel guilty like I used to; that doesn't mean I don't feel bad when I, for example, hurt someone's feelings or something like that. But I don't carry that weight around anymore. Even though I can see many more flaws now (probably because I'm learning to look deeper into myself and situations), I still feel lighter, and more free. 

Buddhism can help us comes to terms with who we truly are, and while it may be ugly at first, it's nothing to feel bad about. It's about first accepting where you are at, then making a conscious effort to transform that. Through this, I'm learning to let go of guilt and open up to my true nature, which is Buddha nature. It's already there, we just have to open our eyes to it.

Does morality affect the extent to which a person has negative meditative experiences?,"I've learned that morality is an important foundation for training in meditative concentration. 

My understanding was that by training in morality, we create the karma for pleasant states of mind, and purify the karma for unpleasant states of mind. Also, by guarding our morality, we develop the qualities which Shantideva calls watchfulness and carefulness which serve to assist us in the development of concentration. Without morality, I thought, it is more probable that a person will have negative experiences with meditation.

I'm reading a [study](https://www.proquest.com/docview/1416383190?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true&sourcetype=Scholarly%20Journals&imgSeq=11) on Buddhist teacher's experiences with their students' negative experiences of meditation. These teachers (four Theravada, four Zen, and four Tibetan - all out of Colorado) cite reasons for negative meditative experiences that do not include morality. Theravadins related these negative experiences to increased concentration without balanced mindfulness. Zen teachers referenced incorrect posture and breathing. Tibetan teachers referenced improper execution of advanced meditative techniques leading to hlung disease. But none of them (apparently) discussed moral training. 

Why is that? Is my understanding of the relationship between morality and meditation wrong, or is there another reason that 12 Buddhist teachers didn't mention it?",Buddhism,1703871213.0,t3_18tsi8h,0.81,9

3) His book ""The Heart of Unconditional Love"" is an inspiring guide on how to develop compassion by using visualization of the Buddha of Compassion - Avalokiteshvara.  In the book, he adapts traditional Tibetan mind training into a system that he feels will work for almost everyone -  the book is a systematic training program to develop one's mind based on Tibetan mind training techniques.  I would only recommend the book for someone looking for a training program; it is a system of training utilizing visualization of deities, not just a simple book on loving kindness.

Those good men or good women who wish to enter the Single Deed

Because the merits of being mindful of one Buddha are as innumerable and boundless

How is ‚Äúwishing‚Äù/praying handled in Buddhism?,"Sorry the title doesn‚Äôt really explain well!

I think that I kind of know the answer, but I‚Äôm very new to Buddhism and would like some more experienced people to give insight.

I‚Äôve ‚Äúdabbled‚Äù in theistic religions, most recently being Hellenic Polytheism, which just didn‚Äôt speak to me the way it had when I practiced in the past. 

In the past (prior to practicing Buddhism), I would pray/wish for things, like many people do within their religions.

"Isolated and struggled for most of my life, how can I gain the strength to practice?","I've lived a very isolated life born into an oppressive Christian cult, my options for interacting with other human beings, aside from my parents who verbally and mentally abused me everyday, were limited. I wasn't allowed to make friends who were not a part of this cult so that meant I wasn't allowed to form connections with schoolmates. I was then homeschooled in my teen years and the only friends I had moved away to serve in a different church, and that's when my deepest isolation began. This has caused me never ending pain and scarred me to the point that I am now unable to form any connection or care about people deeply. Any new people in my life leave just as quick as they appeared. I know about impermanence, yet I continually struggle with the thought that anything that brings a semblance of joy or comfort after dealing with so much pain is only temporary. I've formed too many attachments in order to cope with these feelings, my health is now suffering because of it, and I feel unmotivated to do anything, including to practice. I've tried therapy, gone to many therapists, but I'm unable to speak frankly with them and they tell me things I already know.

I want to practice Buddhism but I fear I may never overcome my pain and isolation and I'll just continue to descend further and further into my attachments. I fear I'll be too caught up in the pain felt and these physical conditions that I'll never find peace, my thoughts and feelings are so strong sometimes. I will continually go back to my old thinking patterns and get caught up in my thoughts after I lose the energy/will to put into practice what I've learned. On the bright side I've been doing some reading with beginner books and it has helped increase my knowledge but I have now once again fallen into another rut.

How does Anatta make sense?,"I partially agree with the idea of non-self (Anatta) on that there is no permanent, fixed identity of oneself because of impermanence (Anicca), and I partially agree with the examples related to Anatta in Buddhist books and videos (e.g., chariot, car, the 5 aggregates of oneself). However, I cannot get myself to agree with them fully. I have 2 questions:

1. Why can‚Äôt the idea of ‚Äúimpermanent self‚Äù or ‚Äúdynamic self‚Äù exist? It seems to me that Anatta states that ‚ÄúI‚Äù do not exist because ‚ÄúI‚Äù am always changing, but why can‚Äôt an existence be dynamic and changing in the first place?
2. It is true that each part of an existence cannot represent the identity of that existence, but I fail to see why they cannot represent an identity once structured in a specific way. Why can‚Äôt one identity be an aggregate of multiple components and exist in that way? For example, it is true that ‚ÄúI‚Äù am not any of my 5 aggregates, and it is true that all my 5 aggregates are always changing, but why cant ‚ÄúI‚Äù be an aggregate of my 5 changing aggregates?

Inspiring Story of Chanting Buddha 33 - The woman in white delivers medicine in her dream ÁôΩË°£Â•≥‰∫∫Â§¢‰∏≠ÈÄÅËó•,"(English and Chinese subtitles )Âøµ‰ΩõÊÑüÊáâË¶ãËÅûË®ò ,  written by venerable laywoman Kanzhi Lin ÊûóÁúãÊ≤ªÂ±ÖÂ£´ (1906-1992 AD) Subtitles:  The dharma of chanting Buddha's names is simple and suitable for men and women, young and old, rich and poor, as long as they are convinced that Buddha is the teacher of the three realms and the loving father of all beings. Those who have faith in Buddha and chant Buddha will be able to eliminate serious sins and obtain abundant blessings. Here are some facts to prove the point.  In about 1957, there was a small family that moved to the north district of Taichung from the suburb.  The host was Mr. Chen, and his wife is Jiao Lin, who had been sick for a long time in her hometown. Although the eldest son, Zhong, was only eight years old, he was a decent child, knowing to serve soup and medicine, and never left his mother's side.  One day, Sister Gold Twig, the leader of the chanting buddha class, went to their home. She saw Jiao lying on the bed, moaning in a state of terminal illness. The child, Zhong, was weeping at his mother's side. When Gold Twig saw it, her compassion arose spontaneously and said to Jiao,  ""Jiao, you must chant. the holy name of Avalokitesvara, the Bodhisattva of Salvation, and pray for recovery soon.  At this point, Jiao whispered, ""I can't chant.""  Gold Twig said, ""You can't chant, it's the same if your children chants for you. You only have to listen quietly and follow the chanting in your heart.‚Äù Gold Twig then invited a picture of the Three Saints of the West, mounted in a mirror frame and hung it on the opposite wall of Jiao's bed.  Then she taught Zhong to put palms together and chant the holy names of Amitabha Buddha and Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva.  This child is very smart and learned it soon. After he had chanted for two hours, she taught him to transfer the merit and pray to the Buddha and Bodhisattva to bless his mother with good health soon.  He could follow all the teachings and often pray before the Buddha devoutly.  With the majestic picture in front of her eyes and the holy names of the great virtue beside her ears, Jiao felt she had support in her heart.  It is inconceivable to recite the holy names of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. The boy, Zhong, prayed to Buddha for his mother's recovery every day. Within a week, a miracle happened.  He called out happily early one morning, ""Mom, Last night I dreamed that a woman dressed in white took a handful of herbs as long as leek and gave them to you. You received them in your hand and put them in your mouth. I saw that distinctly. He also told me that he was Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, if my mother took this herb, she would be safe.""  On hearing that, Jiao felt astonished and told her child: Zhong, I also dreamt that a woman took a handful of long herbs and asked me to eat them. I chewed the herbs in my mouth and swallowed them. When I woke up in the morning, my mind was clear, and I felt my symptom much lighter.  Hence, Jiao's illness returned to health day by day, and mother and son shared the joy of family.  Zhong had planted good roots in his little heart. So every day before going to school, he would always take leave of the Buddha and bow with his palms together, saying, ""Amitabha, I am going to school.""  When coming back home from school, he would always go to the Buddha, with his palms together, bowed and said, ""Amitabha, I am back."" He did that every day and was accustomed to it.",Buddhism,1703814660.0,t3_18tb15p,0.72,3
"Buddhists, how close to love is silence of the mind?","I'm starting to understand something.

Correct me if I'm wrong,

Buddhism diesnt offer us answers, it doesn't seem to overcome suffering, provide answers to the deepest questions all conscious agents have.

It looks to detatch from answers, not to avoid them.

But I I believe buddhism is a state of mind for many, where we realise despite all suffering, inadequacies of the self, failures, imaginations questions, wonderings, what ifs, consequences, judgements, fears, hatred and abandonments, are not to be solved but to be integrated, understood and FRAMED.

I believe buddhism is not an ignorance of these answers, but a deep, profound realisation that the answers are beyond our human understanding. And in this realisation, comes a loving trust with oneself, that despite our limitations and lack of control, we look to detatch, not because we have given up, but we have given in...given in to our own way of navigation, as our natural reverance to what is not necessary.


It is a detachment for the need of answers...so that the questions may be asked without the answers needing to be told...

Is it possible to have goals and ambitions without clinging and attachment?,"As we're coming up to the new year, I'm sure many of us have resolutions, goals and ambitions we want to strive for in 2024 - but is it possible to strive for goals without attachment? 

I've been mulling over this questions for a few days. It's easier to understand how ""ambitions"" based in overtly worldly materialism (e.g. ""I want to buy 5 bugattis"") can lead to suffering as we understand that material goods are temporary and joy they provide is surface and fleeting. But what about goals that are adjacent to spiritual ambitions? For example, one of my goals for 2024 is to move home - primarily for the sake of having a stable living situation that allows for better focus on my spiritual and creative practice. Does this differ at all from desiring impermenant and material goods that only bring fleeting joy?

Is ambition compatible with the Buddhas teachings? Does it depend on the circumstance and reasoning behind said ambition? Or is ambition always tied up in suffering, the impermenance and pain of gains and losses?

How is clinging/attatchment the cause of suffering?,"Hey everyone. I apologise if this is kinda emotional for me. I mean no disrespect to Buddhism, it's precepts and in fact, i consider myself a buddhist.

Buddhism teaches that the cause of suffering is clinging/attatchment. And in certain scenarios, perhaps this could make sense. But I just kinda struggle to see this being put to my case. I was abused as a child by my father and even after the physicial abuse stopped, in the past like two years, I've had a tough relationship with him and even have found myself yearning for a father and his affection. And it's tough for me to explain this suffering I've felt with attatchment because isn't it kinda expected for a young person to be attatched and reliant on his father? Is the role of the father not to love the child and show him affection and take care of him. There is much wisdom in the concept of attatchment causing suffering, but in this case where my father hasn't treated me that well and it's caused me pain, how even today i have this yearning for a father figure and that affection, how would such suffering have been caused by attatchment?

&#x200B;

This is my first post here, so please be kind to me :D

&#x200B;

I started to practise Buddhism few months ago. I really enjoy meditating every single day, for 10 minutes, it brought so much peace and happiness in my life. But the reason why I'm writing this post is because, there are certain individuals at my workplace that are REALLY toxic, they use vulgar language very often, as well as aggressive behavior, through words and actions, like ridiculing someone, laughing at someone, treating specific person like someone stupid. Among those individuals is THAT one, 35 years old, short single guy (let's say his name is Luke), he is very aggressive, using perverted, explicit and vulgar language, he acts like a macho, always threating anyone with a beating, he boasts off to anyone, that he pays prostitutes for sex. He always got on my nerves, irritating me with his obscene and immature behavior, he ridiculed me many time, insulting me, calling me ""Chechen"", and recently, he started insulting me again, calling me ""Conchita"", like that Austrian drag queen from Eurovision Song Contest, just because I have a beard, and everyone seemed to support his foolish behavior, about insulting me and laughed at me too. I was really fed up with his behavior and started to ignore him completely, I stopped talking to him, treating him, like he didn't even exist, and since he is a kind of person that loves attention and likes to make a drama, to get attention, he said that I'm ""f\*cked up"", because I don't answer to his insults and stupid behavior. 

I noticed that there is not even a single person at my workplace that I can talk with, everyone seem to be really treating me like I was some idiot, even though I try to talk to them nicely and politely, because I'm quiet calm and reserved person, as introvert.

So, what should i do with situation, should I definitely ignore them and don't talk with them at all? if my boss tells me to work with them, should I say no or just work with them and be silent? How should I act, when I'm confronted by toxic people, not only at my workplace, how should I behave around them?

Sorry for my questions, but this situation is quite tough for me and I need to handle it out, as fast as I can.",Buddhism,1703705742.0,t3_18s92fn,1.0,2
I have bad karma,"I suppose that in a certain way we all have some bad karma, in my case it is not the worst, however it is difficult for me. In my life it has been very difficult for me to have a balanced life and every time I try to have it something happens that makes everything change and I can't achieve what I want which is so much like having a harmonious life. That is to say, whenever I try to move to a new place and start something, something usually happens that interrupts the situation and makes me unable to achieve what I want, which is just to live a harmonious life. I don't want much, just to have a routine and a community and to be able to learn without constantly having to move where I live or having something happen that doesn't let me have a normal life. I feel that in my life I always have to constantly start from scratch and sometimes I feel that it is tiring. My relationship with more people is usually very good at the beginning but it does not usually last long and ends soon and I have to start from scratch to meet more people and be able to achieve a balanced life. The truth is I don't know what to do, how to purify my karma so that I can have a harmonious life, I feel right now like I have to wait from scratch, I really don't have a close relationship with my friends, I don't work and I put my studies on hold.  I feel that my friends have forgotten about me and that they have no interest in being close to me because they don't even talk to me and when I talk to them they don't answer me, and I think it's my karma because in the past I did that with other people. I feel somewhat frustrated and without much hope and the truth is that I don't know what to do so that this pattern of my life can stop.

What answer does Buddhism have for those with chronic illnesses and lifelong disabilities?,"Hi!  I'm curious what Buddhism says about life for those with chronic/lifelong conditions.  I struggle a lot with gender dysphoria and suicidal thoughts on a daily basis, and have tried transitioning which doesn't seem to help all that much.  As far as I've observed, Buddhism as it's practised where I am (Thailand), seems to focus a lot on karma (an action in one's past life resulted in consequences in their present life) and atonement especially for one's better next life.

Please correct me if I'm mistaken, but I can't help but feel the idea of reincarnation encourages suicide.  I mean, if I could unalive myself with a guarantee I'd reincarnate as a cis woman, I would.  Or even if I'd experience no reincarnation or suffering after death, I'd probably do it too, and have considered many times.  However, isn't this all ... counterproductive?

Dhamma: The law of Nature,"Dhamma (Buddha's teaching) is divided into two groups : Mundane teaching (lokika Dhamma) and Supra-Mundane teaching (lokottara Dhamma).

The first found in the Sutta Pitaka is meant for him/her who wants to live a happy life in the samsara. The second found in the Vinaya Pitaka and the Abhidhamma Pitaka is meant for him/her who wants to live a happy life in the samsara as well as a blissful life in the Nirvana.

Billions of humans live in the samsara. Few of them live in the Nirvana. So the mundane teaching is more important and necessary than the Supra-mundane teaching in terms of human well-being and happiness and peace and harmony in the world.

Of course, there is no alternative to the Supra-Mundane teaching or the Vinaya Pitaka and the Abhidhamma Pitaka if someone wants to understand and practise Dhamma (both mundane and Supra-Mundane) deeply and realise a happy life in the samsara as well as a blissful life the Nirvana.

My understanding of the world from Buddhism point of view,"There are two types of phenomena, permanent and impermanent.

Permanent phenomena may and may not exist forever. But it won't change at all, and won't be caused by other phenomena.

There are three types of impermanent phenomena: form, mind and non-associated. Form, in the other word, physical, like planet, food etc. Mind, in the other word, consciousness or mental. Non-associated, like time, direction, which is not form or mind.

Looking at a person. Person, itself, is a non associated phenomenon, because it's not form or mind. It has five aggregates: form, sensation, perception, formation and consciousness. In the other angle, earth, water, fire, wind, space and mind.

To connect two angles together, four elements: earth, water, fire and wind are form. Space itself is a permanent phenomenon. Mind includes sensation, perception, consciousness and part of formation.

The most important part of a person is the mind. It includes almost four aggregates. It is sort of indivisible in certain points of view. One person's mind won't become two persons' mind. Two persons' minds won't combine into one mind. It's not a function of form(physical phenomena) while form may impact the mind. So the mind is not a function of the brain, while the brain may impact the mind. For example, if there is some brain disease, the mind may behave differently.

In another point, the mind is divisible. At one point of time, the mind can be divided into multiple pieces, like sensation, perception and so on. For example, if people see a beautiful picture, their point of the mind includes the view of the picture, enjoy or not enjoy the picture, name the picture and so on. From time series, one mind can be divided into many moments of mind.

Characteristics of mind are clear and knowing. It's different with four elements of form. That's why form is not the main cause of mind. Cause of mind is the previous moment of mind. There is no antidote for mind. It's why there are previous and next lives. That's why people grow, and eventually die in one life.

Does emptiness not imply futility and meaninglessness?,"Little context for my question: About 2 years ago I started going down an existential crisis brought about by pondering the nature of material reality. Specifically the realization that everything around me, as well as ""me"" is just atoms and sub-atomic particles bouncing around in phsyical and chemical interactions. Me saying ""I love you"" to my romantic partner is just my vocal cords vibrating, that vibration traveling through air and her brain releasing oxytocin. I started to not see beauty, enjoyment, meaning, value in things. Just cold, dead particles bouncing around, in a constant neutral stream of cause and effect. I started to not see animals, plants and people, just cells, tissues mechanically moving around in space. Even the anxiety and depression this caused me was just neural electric activity and my brain releasing cortisol. I remember watching Jaak Panksepp's ted talk on the science of emotions and being baffled at how scientists, specifically neuroscientists can find value and meaning in empathy, love and joy when their life's work is studying how those experiences are nothing but soulless particles moving around in their brain, not much differently from a computer. If I don't believe in a soul, a creator God, or anything of the sort, then it really doesn't ""matter"". I could live, I could die, anyone could live, anyone could die, being alive vs dead is really just your brain actively producing electrical activity or not. No inherent value or purpose. Just nothing.

Recently I started reading up on stoicism, taoism and buddhism, all of which seem to have a much more materially focused and less human-centric view of the universe (as opposed to my protestant christian upbringing), and specifically the idea of emptiness in Buddhism seemed very much similar to the ideas which cause me so much existential despair. There's no ""self"", no ""things"" independently identifiable from each other. The weird thing however, is that despite all this, buddhism still teaches love and compassion for things and that we can overcome suffering. I find it very strange and intruiging how seemingly I ""realized"" or thought about the same things that buddhists did and yet they came to much less pessimistic conclusions as to what to do with that knowledge and what to do in life in general. 

So, my question is, how? How is recognizing emptiness not causing buddhists all over the world and history to just... give up on everything? How can buddhists find value in compassion, service and the reduction of suffering if in the end it's all empty and there's no supreme ""good"" or meaning to life or the universe? Maybe I am completely misunderstanding these concepts, or reality itself, in which case any help bringing me closer to the truth would be appreciated.

His absence casts shadows, takes a heavy toll.

Beneath Himalayan peaks, where prayers ascend,
Panchen Lama's teachings, a timeless blend.
A lighthouse of compassion, a vessel of peace,
In the vast Tibetan plateau, his influence won't cease.

Oh, Panchen Lama, held in unseen chains,
Release his spirit from karmic constraints.
In the scrolls of Dharma, his wisdom inscribed,
A plea for his freedom, compassion derived.

As prayer flags flutter in the mountain air,
We beseech the heavens, a solemn affair.
Grant him liberation, let his spirit soar,
Restore the balance, like waves on the shore.

Through mandalas spun with devotion's thread,
A tapestry woven, where hopes are spread.
May the Lotus-born Lama find his way,
Back to the faithful, where serenity may sway.

Echo the chants, the stories retold.

Free the Panchen Lama, let his light shine.

Exactly 49 days... when my mum passed away,"Dear monks and high level practicioners. 

May I ask some advice what mantra I can sing today ?

Also I'd like to ask that what happens today with my mum's soul / spirit?

As a very beginner Buddhist I am still grieving. But every week this day was the hardest. I'm trying to find shelter in Buddhism. 

Thank You for your kindness",Buddhism,1703667793.0,t3_18rwgh1,0.76,4

Is there any way one can meditate if one expects to wind up with dementia?,I expect to be. It already seems to be a distracting force.  It also seems to make me a little fearful of going into my own mind--a fear I never had before.  I always felt the Truth was there inside my mind once I got thru all the distractions. Now I am not so sure. Does anybody have any experience or reference materials on this subject? Thank you.,Buddhism,1703657692.0,t3_18rtqjc,0.81,9
Monk,I kinda find it funny. When I was younger one of my dreams was to be a monk (I was like 7-9 years old). That was because of a TV show I watched but now I want to be one again but I also want to be a psychologist so I can't be both so I sadly put the dream of being a monk aside.,Buddhism,1703657429.0,t3_18rtnvh,1.0,7
How to deal with and accept surgical & pain fears?,"If I have to undergo surgery or pain, perhaps due to sickness or giving birth. What should I be

thinking along process? **How do I calm down or make myself ‚Äústrong‚Äù to go through this?**

&#x200B;

Saying it‚Äôs worth it in the end,  focus on the ""good picture"" or result, knowing that medical

advancement can ease the process do not help much. I believe it might be a mental game or

having right mindset for me.

&#x200B;

I have seen many fears and helpless expressions saying they are scared, terrified of the soon-to-

happen event and hope everything ends quick, and most seems to adopt a mindset that once they

endure the pain it would be over, they will alright.

&#x200B;

Why does it have to be like that? Is there no other way to accept the process better? If I ever came

across this, I don‚Äôt want to be afraid, keep worrying and not accepting all the possibilities. Because

I may end up miserable. üßòüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èin Buddhism, we are taught to be accepting of the impermanence but

how? Thank you in advance.

Side note:Actually I'm writing base on my pregnancy fears. I've read some Buddhism scriptures; correct me if I'm wrong but generally the sins of women are greater than men. Because nature & societal expectations made women hold greater responsibility. If that's the case it makes me wonder what if i choose to escape birth this life, will I get something else similar in return or I still have to face it next life? But I do remember the scriptures say if I do something, good karma and pray I want to be a man next life I will be man haha",Buddhism,1703655933.0,t3_18rt7oe,0.67,1
"Right Speech, Art, & Music","Hi!


Curious on some Buddhist perspective here.


Art & music that deals with taboo subjects, is this compatible with the dharma?

I once wrote an ‚Äúevil doo wop song‚Äù - it deals with the idea of revenge.

I‚Äôm curious the Buddhist community‚Äôs view on how art and creativity would fall under right speech, etc. 

If there is no intention to cause harm, but also no moralizing in the song, so not entirely a parable -

Is it a good thing to have art that wakes people up to their shadow? Is it immoral and sowing discord?

Why is guan yin‚Äôs birthday celebrated if she never physically existed?,"I only just started at a Theravada temple but have always felt an odd emotional pull to the story and images of Guan Yin (and still don‚Äôt know much about him/her) but am confused as to some of the important calendar days related to him/her, specifically birthday, renunciation day and enlightenment day. If she/he historically wasn‚Äôt a real person, why celebrate any of these three days and give importance to arbitrary dates? It seems like it would be akin to celebrating Christmas if Jesus wasn‚Äôt an historical person.

Has anyone here lived in a south east Asian monastery long term? Did it affect your health?,"I lived in south east asian monasteries getting up at 3.30am every day and only being allowed to sleep for 6 hours per night for nearly 5 years. This coupled with tiny portions of food which by western standards at least was not nutritious at all and I suffered from undernutrition. It really effected my health, my teeth ached, my bones ached, I had no energy and I had to leave because of these factors. 

On the upside I learnt a lot and it made me a better person. Back in the western world people are running around absolutely clueless, their minds are all over the place.

Nun Expulsion vs Monk Confession,"Hello!

I'm wondering why in the Theravada Vinaya, a nun concealing another nun's parajika entails expulsion (see https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6/en/brahmali), but a monk concealing another monk's grave offense merely entails confession (see https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc64/en/brahmali)

In both origin stories, the concealed offense is grave (sex, a parajika, in the nuns' case, and masturbation, a sanghadisesa, in the monks' case), but only in the nuns' case is the concealer of the grave offense also expelled.

Bhikkhuni Parajika 6 explicitly covers only offenses entailing expulsion, while Bhikkhu Pacittiya 64 covers both offenses warranting expulsion and suspension.

On the one hand this seems to imply that if a nun concealed another nun's offense entailing mere suspension, this would not be an offense at all, whereas for a monk it would be an offense entailing confession. 

On the other hand, it is explicit that if a monk conceals another monk's offense entailing expulsion, this would only be an offense entailing confession, whereas for a nun it would entail expulsion, which does not seem fair!

I know that the Buddha only made rules if someone first performed the act in question (hence why there is always an exception for the first offender) but I don't think that explains why he didn't limit Bhikkhu Pacittiya 64 only to concealing offenses entailing suspension.

The bare fact is, if a monk conceals another monk's parajika, he need only confess so, but if a nun conceals another nun's parajika, she is expelled.

Hopefully I don't offend anyone when I say I'm pretty convinced that many parts of the Vinaya were added after the time of the Buddha, by people who were not free of mental afflictions. I've read the discussions of some scholars who reject the historicity of the eight garudhammas, and I am inclined to agree, but I think it would also explain a lot if the rules here were not in fact implemented by the Buddha as tradition holds.

Unless I'm mistaken, there's not yet any English translation of the Mulasarvastivada Vinaya, but I am hoping to find out if there are parallel infractions there as well.",Buddhism,1703643284.0,t3_18rp3qx,0.65,4

Was Buddha believer in Hinduism before enlightment?,"I know that in  Buddha's teachings, there were no Gods (their existence was also not denied), so we can't say what was Buddha's believe when he preached. But we know that he was wealthy person from royal familly before, and it's almost 100% certain that he was told to believe and workship Hindu Gods, but was he believer? Can we say that before enlightment he focussed on gods? Or was he always more focused on karma and good deeds (even before enlightment)?",Buddhism,1703638952.0,t3_18rnlic,0.86,14
