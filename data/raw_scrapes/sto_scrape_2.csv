"I have cheated and now I'm heartbroken, in need of stoic guidance","I cheated on my ex-girlfriend (Whom I'm still close with) whilst we were in a committed relationship and she found out now she never wants to see me again, breaking my heart.  I never told her and hid it because I was too ashamed, insecure and afraid of the consequence. I have lost a person who I deeply cared about and likely also a lot of our coming friends. 

I have betrayed my own morals and principles. I don't know what to do now and feel really lost.

Update: 

 
Thanks to everyone who provided me with advice, I appreciate it dearly.

I'm not looking for empathy pity or salvation. I'm well aware of facing the consequences of my actions. Not only have I lost somebody who I deeply care about, I have also hurt her in a way that may effect the rest of her life. That's where the pain truly comes from and it shook me to my core.

I'm here because I'm lost and broken. I am looking for rebuild myself from the ground up and and get on the right part. I just don't know where to start.",Stoicism,1690656287.0,t3_15czm6z,0.49,0

I am affected by what is currently happening in Gaza.,"I feel like nothing makes any sense anymore. How can people sleep comfortably knowing that their fellow human beings are experiencing genocide and children and innocent people are being killed? I feel guilty for having the privilege and resources to achieve my goals, for being able to buy meals, for having a roof over my head. I feel guilty about living. I am so sad for the people suffering and it's out of my control.

**\*\*\*READ THIS\*\*\***

Just because I specifically mentioned Gaza doesn't mean I am not compassionate toward other races and countries too. What is wrong with some of you? I pity both the innocent people of Israel and Palestine. I am also saddened by what has happened in both Ukraine and Russia. I HAVE EMPATHY FOR ALL HUMAN KINDS AND RACES. Why are you all assuming the other way? I DESPISE ALL FORMS OF EVIL. I am not siding with any side; I am against the people who are in charge behind all of this cruelty and those who support these actions.

Just because something worse happened in other countries doesn't mean we shouldn't stand up for other countries too. I don't know wtf happened to compassion. Why can't we all just be fvcking kind.

Here's what's currently happening in Gaza:

but here me out things sounds great on paper but today when shit hit the fan i couldn't say oh this is out of my control and i should accept it and move on. it didn't work like this for me, i thought about it i  even slept without eating, i couldn't put what i read to practice.

UPDATE: Stoics are too passive,"After reading the responses on the last post, I remain resolute in my conclusion that modern practitioners of stoicism are too passive. Passiveness / pacifism are not good and virtuous in and of themselves. In the comments people were saying I had a misunderstanding of Stoicism  and how it is not pacifism per se, I agree and explain this distinction below, and that I have not read the stoics. I disagree, I have read Aurelius, Seneca, and Epictetus (the latter of which is my favorite).

&#x200B;

Don't behave cowardly and be passive and put up with it because it is cowardice masquerading as virtue. Defend your honor. There was a time when men of the past understood this idea and even dueled and put their life on the line in order to defend their honor. I am NOT saying that we go back to dueling or escalate to violence, only using that example to indicate that once upon a time men were courageous and masculine and would be willing to fight to defend their honor. To those who are going to misconstrue everything I have said, here are my basic claims so you dont put words in my mouth: 

1) Stoicism is fantastic for dealing with life events out of your control eg getting let go from your work, getting broken up with, dealing with an infirmity etc.

2) Stoicism is not fantastic for social life events in your control that require action. In practice, stoicism is very close to pacifism by modern practitioners of stoicism. This is because stoicism in some sense emasculates you because you wont have the proper masculine aggression that is needed in situations like defending your honor when you're getting bullied, teased, ridiculed, having your gf getting harassed by men, youre out with your mom and someone touches her etc, your inaction would be the result of your calm rational stoic principles that would be absolutely useless here.  When your kid is getting bullied, what do you tell them? Son be stoic and let the bullies take your money, hit you, deride you and be effectively labeled the biggest wimp in the school because as long as you have virtuous thoughts that all that matters little man. 

I am aware that stoicism is not pacifism. Dont misrepresent me. I understand Aurelius was an emperor of rome who led battles against germanic tribes. Only that in practice, modern adherents of stoicism would not encourage aggression or standing up for yourself and your honor/ your gf / your mother etc in the false name of virtue and letting things be and not allowing aggression get to you bc we're stoics and we should not let emotions get to us and we should be rational. However it is clear that this approach does not work in these social situations and not taking action is extremely cowardly.

3) I am not saying go guns blazing with violence or 10/10 aggression, only that you have the tools of aggression, potential for violence, a willingness for confrontration etc and use them judiciously in amounts that fit the situation should you be presented with a circumstance like above.

The bottom line: stoicism is not a one size fits all bandage for all your problems. When stoicism is helpful: for things out of your control like a break up, an illness, kid got into a car accident, staying calm and composed in these situations is extremely good and honorable.

When stoicism is bad: when guys are touching / flirting with your girlfriend and youre standing there idly and meekly because your stoic beliefs have hindered your aggression. Your kid is being bullied, youre out with your mom and someone touches her etc. I am not saying you beat them to a pulp, use rational judgment when deciding how much force, aggression, and potential violence is needed to end the situation without being a coward, yet avoid the other extreme of being a volatile angry mad man who wants to fight anyone who looks at you funny.

What would the stoics have thought about eating animals in modern day?,"After reading meditations, it's clear that Marcus Aurelius was focused on living within his own nature as a human being, and valued the humans ability to reason above everything.

On one hand, eating meat is human nature, we are clearly omnivores and have eaten meat as a species for as long as we've been around. 
However in modern day, eating meat isn't a requirement to live a healthy life, and the mass production of meat is widely thought to be inefficient and cruel, so using reason and the information we have available, eating meat wouldn't be the virtuous choice.

I've just been thinking about this lately, and thought there was a bit of a clash between our nature and our ability to reason in this area. There's probably more stuff like this as the modern world is so different to what was going on back when Marcus was knocking about.",Stoicism,1702292647.0,t3_18fs32u,0.53,5

Is stoicism a “whiteman’s doctrine?,"I would like to first start off apologizing by the provocative title. I, being a “black” stoic who debates the woke black conscious community (Afrocentrics, Hoteps/Egyptologists and Black Hebrew Israelites, etc) and they tell me that I’m indoctrinated with a whiteman’s doctrine.  I wanted to share a random fact that the founder of Stoicism Zeno was actually black. This of course isn’t to make it woke because it does NOT matter what he looked like, but Diogenes in his work Life and Times of Imminent Philosophers tells us that Zeno the Phonecian from Cyprus was a swarthy man “hence he was called the Egyptian vine-branch”.  Zeno after being shipwrecked in Athens started reading the works of Socrates(Plato) and subsequently founded the school of Zenoism/Stoicism.  People may ask what is my point and it is simply me venting. I get picked on by woke black people for my deep affection of Ancient Greek work and because they are woke, they are ignorant of the fact that Zeno was actually black. While I wasn’t physically shipwrecked in Athens, my journey began once I started studying Plato and I can tell how Zeno was able to cultivate this wonderful philosophy.",Stoicism,1689092227.0,t3_14wvqzm,0.52,3
Struggling with sexual desire and buying sex,"Although sex is a normal thing, as a single virgin 28M am struggling with it. Ideal solution would be to have a stable relationship with someone, and i can do it if i pursue. But i come from a conservative background where my parents won't accept it. I have been seeing a few woman online chat/call upon their recommendation, but i live in abroad (in a more liberal society), so the communication gap with the other people matters a lot. I have been away from my family over 5 years. I do need physical affection and love and hug in this single life (friends are not enough). I don't see myself getting married soon, and i have been seriously considering buying instead of wasting my 20s youth time just like that. Can’t deny that this sex drive may have affected my work. Ethically i am against porn and trafficking. But i am not sure what would be of me if i buy sex. In the end, i don't think i will find any open-minded woman who will accept my ""past sex-buying"" experience.

I think male sex drive is uniquely high. We can disregard it focusing on productive works, but that never vanishes the urge. The urge is like a pitfall, you will fall to it naturally if you roam near it, if the atmosphere provokes yourself. Then how do i confront this hidden energy? Whether i accept myself or obtain strategies to be blind to the sex drive- that's what i wonder.",Stoicism,1701645800.0,t3_18a6gcx,0.47,0
I’ve achieved everything I want at 35 – and I feel life is pointless. Can anyone relate?,"First of all, I do understand that this is an insane luxury problem to have. But nevertheless, a problem.

I’ve achieved and experienced literally everything I can imagine in life.

I have a net worth close to 7 M USD after selling my company a few years ago. I have excelled in school and have a master degree. I have traveled literally the whole world. I have had a ton of fun and partied a lot. I have dated a ton of women. I have a stable and great girlfriend for many years. I have a nice house and a nice car. I’m in great shape and live healthy. I have fantastic friends and family.

Objectively, I should be happy. But I am not. For the past 15 years I’ve constantly been pushing the boundaries to achieve and experience more. And now I feel like there’s nothing that ever makes me excited or feel alive anymore.

I am having a fairly normal life. I do trips. Spend time with family and girlfriend. I have started to work on a new company.

But everything feels pointless. Nothing really makes me excited. Nothing makes me feel alive. The few times I feel excited is when I have sex with my girlfriend, and I am starting to feel that it's slowly becoming a sex addiction as it's the only time I still can feel alive.

I used to have big dreams and work toward everything I wanted to achieve and experience. Now it feels like I’ve already done it all, and everything just feels empty.

I don’t feel depressed, just apathy.

It’s so hard for me to talk about it with friends as no one really can relate to it.

CBT is highly overrated in this sub,"I mean, with all respect, cognitive based therapies are perfect for some people with some problems, but I get feeling that CBT is almost idolized by some stoics in this sub, just because there is a debatable connection, between modern cognitive psychology and ancient texts. 
I am psychologist with interest in emotion/body based therapies, I respect psychotherapist with more cognitive approach, but honestly, it’s not a deep psychotherapy when you just scratch cognitive surface in situations where emotions/relationship involved.  
And very often sub stoics, just indoctrinate everyone and everybody, about “scientifically based, modern approach” even when OP asking about advice in family situation. 
And it’s a nightmare. 
“You have a narcissistic partner? CBT!” 
“You feel like you don’t deserve love? CBT!”
It’s reminds me of situation with my distant friend. She has highly controlling mother who interfering with  her life even after separation and induce anxiety, fear, self doubt in her. And CBT psychologist instead of exploring that connection with her mother, just gave her home task to make a list of every trigger that she have.
And she made it. And then remade it. And again and again in fear that she forgets something.

Ta da and farewell,"Dear Stoic Community,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. I am writing to inform you that I have decided to step away from the Stoicism subreddit for the time being. While this community has been a source of inspiration and learning for me, I have noticed an increasing number of posts that veer off the core principles of Stoicism.

The essence of Stoicism lies in the pursuit of wisdom, virtue, and inner tranquility through the acceptance of what we cannot change and the diligent focus on what is within our control. Lately, I have observed an influx of posts that deal with personal struggles such as loneliness, loss, and betrayal. While these experiences are undoubtedly significant and deserve empathy and support, they are more suited for spaces dedicated specifically to personal support and self-help.

It is my sincere hope that the Stoicism subreddit will regain its focus on the teachings and practices that have brought us all together. Until such a time arises, I will be seeking out or possibly contributing to a new community that adheres more closely to the principles of Stoicism.

In the interim, I leave you all with a reminder to embrace 'amor Fati' – to love and accept all that happens, to find beauty and purpose in every twist of fate.",Stoicism,1695474999.0,t3_16q4b5q,0.45,0

Friend keeps using N word,"Im from Australia, im of african descent, my friend of asian descent used the n word around me and instantly apologised and said they can’t help it and its a bad habit, i told them “its probably best to not use this word if u have to apologise to me every time you use it”. Then again a few weeks later they used the word and apologised and I again addressed them and told them that its affecting our friendship and to stop using the word, they minimized it by saying everyone is getting soft and reminiscing about their younger days when everyone did. They then mentioned they can use the F word as an example (derogatory for gays) if they were angry as it isn’t offensive then because “once they are angry they have no morals”. I called them immature and left it at that after accepting their apology. What would you do in a situation like this?

Ryan Holiday and the Virtue of “Drag story-time”,"I was going to post a picture but it seems I’m not allowed to in the community (I don’t get on Reddit or the internet too often.) Ryan Holiday tweeted today about how he was putting on a “Drag story-time” at his bookstore, The Painted Porch. I refuse to acknowledge that exposing young children to explicitly sexual entertainment, such is the case at Drag shows, is actually virtuous and I’m actually the immoral one for wanting to halt “progress.” I would also argue anyone saying that it is virtuous needs a serious reexamination of their values. Which of the 4 virtues exactly is being ticked off when exposing children to sexual entertainment? I don’t want to get too political but this is the nature of the conversation. It seems as though Ryan, and a lot of Stoics quite frankly, take an incredibly surface level and emotionally satisfying approach to dealing with politics. I feel like as long as Ryan thinks he’s “on the right side of history” he can do whatever he wants, including children drag shows. I find it odd that during his daily email, he made some long screed about how terrible Jan 6th was, but I didn’t hear a word about the entire summer of riots earlier. Why? Those rioters were on the right side of history and were claiming they want to end racism and progress. It doesn’t matter if communities were destroyed and people lost their lives, they claimed to be the good guy. Either call it all out or call out nothing.

How can I accept that I will never gonna be able to get revenge on my worst bully?,"I've done it before on my cousin who bullied me for years and it felt good that I've finally freed myself from the trauma he caused me. I only got little punishment for it because I was still a minor at the time. But the triumphant feeling only lasted for a few months because I remembered that I have another bully who is just as worse. So I prepared for a few months for getting ready for my next revenge. I bought a heavy solid weapon, one ranged non-lethal weapon, and a sharp object. I grew my forearm muscle by swinging the heavy solid weapon for a few months and hitting my punching bag repeatedly as hard as I could everyday till I get tired. I improved on handling the sharp object by practicing using it everyday. I got rid of incriminating media and stuff in my house to not get additional charges. But by the time I was ready to face my bully after mustering up the courage for months, I have reached the legal age which makes it now impossible for me to get away with what I'm going to do with that bully. 

But the thing is, I can't let go of the anger I have towards him, because during the months of my preparation for my supposedly revenge, I recalled every single shitty memory I had with him to fill my heart with rage and use that anger to motivate me towards my goal and because of that I realized that he's actually the worst bully I ever had in my life. He belittled me, he always gave me unsolicited help which convinced me that I am incapable, he emasculated me, he humiliated me, he ridiculed my intelligence, he always invaded my personal space,  he forced me to do humiliating shit, he broke my stuff, he borrowed stuff from me and never returned it, he used my bedroom as his jerk-off space, he made fun of my parents, he did all of this while pretending to be my friend and using me for almost a decade. This is really messing with my mind and I can't even go through a day without having an anger outbursts.

Even though I know I'm now old enough to go to prison, I still feel like doing it. Because I feel like I wasted a lot of time and effort on preparing if I don't do it. And I feel like I just threw away my not-so-legal rare media and rare stuff that I worked hard to get for nothing if I don't do it. And I'm really chasing for that cathartic feeling followed by the act of revenge considering how much tremendous mental suffering he caused on me, I imagine it would feel so good again to release all of this mental burden.

Would an ancient stoic in today's world be a social justice warrior?,"The main tenets of stoicism deal with being virtuous, doing the right thing, and taking action on what you believe is right. Everyone of course has their set of morals, but in stoicism we're meant to try to be objective and selfless with our morals and acting in-line with those morals is extremely important.

This lead me to the thought that ancient stoics have a lot in common with what we call ""social justice warriors"" today. However after thinking about it, I have some reservations about whether they really are similar (I believe they are quite opposite actually).

"A woman cheated on her girlfriend with me, and I feel like I should feel regret, but I don't.","With how stoicism is focused on being a decent and respectful human being, and doing what is good for other people, I know what I did wasn't good and I should have rejected that woman since I knew she was probably cheating, or at least regret doing it after the fact.

But I don't, and I don't think that's right.

It might be it's how we've been told as men that scoring is good no matter what, or it even makes you cool to make someone cheat, being told ""if she cheats its her mistake, she has to be faithful not you king"", something I've been told multiple times.

So i know what i allowed to happen is wrong and may cause pain to people that don't deserve it, a non-stoic move in itself, but an even more non-stoic thing is that I still don't feel much regret or sorrow towards it, since I've largely been told it's cool and alright to do, and I don't know if i would be able to say no if I was in that situation again, so I don't think I'v learned from mistakes and become better either.

Marcus Aurelius couldn't keep his d*** in his pants,"He had 13 children. He loved to fuck, and felt super guilty about it.

Seneca may have been exiled from Rome for fucking the Emperor's sister or something.

But most importantly, these men were human.

They did their best to uphold the idea of the virtuous man, and they all failed, and thats okay, because they are human.

And as much as we must dispell the notion that stoics seek to get rid of emotion, we must also fispell the idea that our heros were these perfect people.

They were flawed. They had vices and temptations, challenges of character and tough decisions to make. Some of which they failed at.

And that is perfectly fine. We still remember them thousands of years later, not in spite of their flaws, but because of their flaws. And their desire to strive past them in the healthiest way (they could see) and to always seek to challenge themselves to be better, and to akways press on with the lessons from your failures learned.

I feel like I permanently ruined my life at 25,"I’m 25 years old and I got a contrast MRI 4 months ago and I feel like I ruined my life with the contrast. Nuero ordered it because I had a ‘complex migraine’ and visual disturbance with a history of meningitis as a baby. I don’t know why he ordered the first MRI with contrast, they usually do without it the first time around. 

The MRI tech never had me read the med guide stating trace amounts of the heavy metal retains pretty much indefinitely or I would’ve turned it down. They told me it’s water-soluble and all gone in 24 hours. I found out about retention after and went down the gadolinium rabbit-hole, reading all the horror stories and bad experiences people had. Also found a FB group of people suffering from toxicity from it and other anecdotal reports that did not help. 

I essentially had a mental breakdown that landed me in the psych ward for a week. I can’t cope with knowing that I have it in my brain and body forever, even if nothing happens. I’m physically fine (so far) and I don’t want medical advice but I just cannot mentally come to terms with this. I feel completely unsafe in my own body now and have been dissociating so much. 

I do have anxiety and OCD but this just took them over the top. I’m currently doing therapy with a combination of CBT and EMDR, but it hasn’t helped much. It’s only been a few session so far. My primary doc thinks I’ll probably need an antidepressant prescription to get over this but I’m hesitant to go down that road. I’ve been suffering over this with nonstop anxiety and depression for 4 months and I feel so hopeless. I’d appreciate any advice, guidance, or perspective.

I have a little brother who I'd kill for and die for, he's a little difficult to deal with but I love him none the less. I'm supposed to protect him from the dangers of this world but I can't even protect him from my fucking self. I don't mean to hurt him in any way possible but it seems like I keep unintentionally damaging him. I don't know what to do. Just an hour ago i was attempting to get him off my bed so that he can go to his as it's night time and I didn't want him to get scolded(he has a tendency to take forever to get on the bed) and I thought he got his footing when I lifted him up but he didn't. He fell backwards in a kneeling type position and then he fell back and hit his head hard. The sound was fucking horrifying. As he hit his head he cried Mama! Mama! Man that was fucking hard to listen to man 😢. Then he started crying and I held him up. He held his head as he was crying and I don't know what to fucking do man, i feel so fucking guilty. He's okay now and is on his bed but there's this huge bump that hurts on his head and I just can't keep myself together when i think about it. Not the first time he's hit his head because of me and i didn't mean to. I never mean to and yet he still gets fucking hurt. I've never had thoughts about ending my life and I never will but i just think i might. Thank God 🙏 he was seen to by my mom and is okay now but I don't know, i don't know what to do.


Hey guys I appreciate the comments. The reason why I needed to get it out was because it's not the first time I accidentally hurt him when I had no intention to. It sucks knowing that i could possibly hurt him when trying to help him and when i do remember i try to be mindful but I'm a fairly forgetful person so it doesn't always register. I'm not a weak guy mentally in any way whatsoever but damn does it hurt when I know i could be responsible for something terrible to happen to my brother.

I knew they were religious, but I didn't know until just then how closed minded and secretly hateful they were.

My girlfriend posted a video of her shaking her ass with her male friends and I am devastated by it.,"My girlfriend (22) and I (22) have been together for almost a year. We are doing a long distance thing where we meet once a month. We are not technically in a relationship but we both are extremely attached with eachother and are keeping things unlabelled yet exclusive. We treat eachother like we're in a relationship and the reason for not getting into a relationship yet is other reasons and not related to us.

She lives in a different city and goes out with her friends quite often. She is a very popular and attractive girl where guys hit on her often. but when it comes to her, she is extremely reserved, doesn't give other guys much space and has clear cut boundaries with guys. This is something i like about her. But since past month, she has been going out with the gang in which 2-3 guys have already made a move on her ( for which i completely have no problem because i trust her and her boundaries). They went together for drinking, night outs, parties. They even make a lot of sexual references for jokes, that dude gives her the coat if she feels cold. I mean i have zero problem with all the above because it's her life she can do whatever she want. But I felt like things went overboard when she posted a reel of them hanging out that night where for fun she has shaked her ass with a guy and others were looking at her and laughing. I completely lost my shit this was way too much. It rattles me up that she says that she doesn't like enjoy a lot hanging with that gang yet she goes around shaking her ass like what?!?!?

I'm not a narrow minded person or a fucking bigot. But this is actually something which bothered me because she is not a person who used to dance like this and give ideas to these guys. My question is, does she enjoy that attention? why does she have to do that when we have something stable going on.

Now the issue is i dropped a text saying it wasn't right thing to do and it irks me i told. She is still in shock that i said this since usually i don't have any problem with her lifestyle but this actually affected me. now she's sending me ss of her friends saying that, the dance she did is normal and Iam being controlling.

I am the last person when it comes to being controlling. Call me old fashioned, but i date to marry. So i see a wife material in her and i don't want my girl to go around shake her ass infront of guys who have interest towards her and she has also told me that she is moderately comfortable with them. I feel dissappointed and feel like my whole perception of her is wrong. Right now we haven't sorted it out and I'm waiting for her to say something. I can't go down and say sorry because i haven't done anything wrong. I have no problem with her dancing and all, but shaking her ass that way is no way okay for me! What should I do? will be constantly disappointed? Should I make things work between us or should we call it quits? Because trust me, some issues are major deal breaker for me.

This feels like a therapy subreddit more than a stoic one..,"Seriously.. Too many people seem to come here thinking making a post on reddit and reading their responses will cure inner suffering. Honestly seems quite silly. Must have something to do with popular culture thinking stoic == no emotion or pain.   


The pain/anxiety/affliction aint gonna go away until it's meant to. Reading a few books won't make it disappear. Posting on reddit won't make it go away. Eventually it will fade, as all things do, whether it's next week or after this life ends. The negative emotions aren't bad though, they just feel bad.  


 Anxiety isn't bad, it feels bad for sure, but it's kept our species from being easy meals to predators.

Loneliness isn't bad. Again it may feel bad, but without loneliness, humanity would again be prey to predators. We only rose to our place in the world by collaborating and working with others. Without loneliness, we wouldn't have collaborated, and well we'd still be running from lions.  


Depression isn't bad, without it humanity would've fell into complacency because without it, why improve things?  


Stoicism won't erase your emotions. It won't make you a tin man without feeling. What it will do is allow you accept these seemingly negative emotions for what they are, and realize that they aren't bad/good. Things will still feel bad and good, because those emotions will always exist, but you won't spend your life trying to dodge pain and grasp at pleasure. Emotions are just signals in the mind after all, meant to keep us alive (and reproducing).",Stoicism,1668110004.0,t3_yrpxff,0.51,1

"Genuinely curious, why should I live if no one can love me","I don’t have a single friend. They all abandoned me for various reasons or they betrayed me. I always was treated like an option or just a background character. Never treated like a *friend*. I’ve never had a boyfriend or a girlfriend before because I am physically unattractive. I’m 24 and female. My relationship with my immediate family has been diminishing since I’ve been completely alone for years. 

I’ve never felt proper love. I’ve been alone, ignored, treated like shit by nearly everyone around me, stranger or not. I can’t make friends, but either way, I don’t really want to because I can’t trust or tolerate anyone anymore after being alone for so long. No one understands that my life is over, there is no hope or “right people” for me. It’s either gas myself (I already have a suicide plan) or live the rest of my life alone, depressed and struggling. No one wants to be around me, no matter what I do no one wants to be my friend and no one wants to be with me because I’m ugly. And no, this is not going to change. Despite what people say, no it doesn’t get better or change. It doesn’t matter what I’ve done, I’ve never won socially. 

I’ve met so many people and befriended them. Only for a temporary time. And I’m still completely alone. My personality is bitter and angry, nothing can change that. My life is truly over and no. Like I said. It’s not going to change. I’ve been like this since I left high school. 

Why should I live? I don’t know anyone else, online or irl in the same situation. Sure, they may not have ever had a parter, but they have friends. Or vice versa. But no one has neither except me.

hi! i'm 19 (f) and i need advices.,"hi everyone :) like i said in the title i need some help for this case.

I have an anxious attachment ( i don't know where I got it, never had a boyfriend before etc, so all that i can say that i'm looking at my past, but that's not the point  and i don't want to talk about it) but my boyfriend is vere communicative, he really loves me and he shows that trough actions, so i'm not worried about him, i trust him, 
but sometimes the thoughts get really dark, everytime I have one i help myself with some self talk, i do things that I love, but there's one thought that i can't escape from: when he goes out in the evening with his group ( there are some girls ofc and  i have some insecurities about them, but i'm working on it), one night it was 2.30am and he walked this girl to her house because she lives in a dangerous area, when he got home he told me everything, why he did that,  he even told me he was sorry because he wrote that only when he arrived at home.
the point is, he did a good thing ( because of the dangerous area and that can be scary for a girl) i'm not mad at him, but now everyday i feel anxious if he goes out with his group in the evening, i'm terrified that the girl can fall in love with him or even do something! or that he can develop some feelings for her too. i'm scared.
what can i do about these thoughts, i can't just do something that calms me in that moment, i need affirmations that can help me.

AI simulated conversation between Marcus Aurelius and Buddha,"I tried posting this to r/Buddhism however it got removed for being a ""low-effort post""... I was simply trying to stimulate conversation in a community with similar interests as mine (you know, the whole point of Reddit...) Anyways, I prompted Chat GPT to simulate a conversation between Marcus Aurelius and the Buddha given I am interested in the similarities between these two teachings that originated in completely different parts of the world and completely different cultures. 

Sure, here's a hypothetical conversation between Marcus Aurelius, the Stoic philosopher and Roman Emperor, and Buddha, the spiritual teacher and founder of Buddhism.

**Marcus Aurelius**: Greetings, Buddha. It is an honor to meet you. I have long admired your teachings and your wisdom.

**Buddha:** Thank you, Marcus Aurelius. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I have heard of your reputation as a great philosopher and leader.

**Marcus Aurelius:** I have always believed in the importance of living a virtuous life and striving to be the best version of oneself. I find that the Stoic philosophy resonates with me in this regard.

**Buddha:** I understand. In my teachings, I also emphasize the importance of cultivating a virtuous character and living a life of mindfulness and compassion.

**Marcus Aurelius:** Yes, I have heard that you teach about the impermanence of all things and the importance of detachment from worldly desires. How do you reconcile this with the Stoic belief in living in harmony with nature and accepting what we cannot change?

**Buddha:** While it is true that I teach about the impermanence of all things, I also believe that we should strive to live in the present moment and appreciate the beauty of life. We can practice detachment without becoming apathetic or indifferent to the world around us. The key is to cultivate an inner peace and contentment that is not dependent on external circumstances.

**Marcus Aurelius:** I see. In Stoicism, we believe that the key to happiness is to focus on the things that are within our control and accept the things that are outside of our control. We also believe in the power of reason and self-discipline in shaping our thoughts and actions.

**Buddha:** That is a wise philosophy. In Buddhism, we also emphasize the importance of cultivating wisdom and discipline to overcome the suffering that arises from our attachment to desires and our aversion to pain.

**Marcus Aurelius:** I can see that there are many similarities between our philosophies. We both believe in the importance of living a virtuous life and developing inner strength and resilience. It is refreshing to find common ground with someone from a different culture and tradition.

**Buddha:** Indeed, Marcus Aurelius. We may come from different backgrounds, but our shared commitment to the pursuit of wisdom and enlightenment unites us. It is an honor to have this conversation with you.

Was Epictetus Wrong?,Hi everyone. I love Epictetus and his philosophy but something is blowing my mind. Epictetus says that our actions within our power. These are free things that nobody can block or limit. But there is a disorder that ADHD. If u have it then ADHD can block and limit u. If u dont have pills u will be lazy and cant concentrate.

Ryan Holiday,"Hey! Does anyone have had experience with Ryan Holiday’s work?
I found the website Daily stoic, and saw that he wrote a few books. I’m right now mostly reading books from Massimo Pigliucci, as well as meditations from Marcus Aurelius. 
To think that I came across stoicism by randomly playing a podcast on Spotify, definitely grateful.

EDIT: First of all, I'd like to apologize for creating another Ryan Holiday thread. I've been told that it was a subject that came back quite often. Being new to Reddit, I honestly had no idea what Sub etc... meant, and I'm still learning, so I did not know I could search for something specific within this community :s 

Maybe this can help someone who wonder the same thing. 
My concern was mostly, Does Holiday work fit into Stoicism? 
From the answers I've got, not really. Most of the feedback on the thread mentioned self helped, and when I went on a sub that was indicated to me, most of the comments were talking about our it help them getting thru a difficult time.
Does it include Stoicism? I believe so. It seem to be some self help based on different/multiple philosophy, especially Stoicism.(At least I would supposed so)

My girlfriend made an interesting argument.,"Ok. A little background:

I used to be really depressed after my ex broke up with me. To the suicidal point... long story short, I found stoicism and it pulled me out of the depressive spiral and I got a lot better to the point I'm at today. I've always loved philosophy and ideas and thinking, and finding stoicism was like a ""gift from god"" because I've always been naturally kind of stoic and I could actually put my interest in philosophy towards a way of life and living. And finally, me and a long time friend recently reconnected after a weird history and now we're dating... it's great and she's kinda ""interested"" in this stoicism thing I talk about and how it brought me out of my depression. 

(Also, by no means do I consider myself a stoic. I am young, I am reading, and I am practicing. This is for debate/answers/opinions.)

Anyway:

Whenever we talk about stoicism, she understands the basic premises and I believe her, but there's one argument she makes that keeps me thinking and I don't really have a counter to. 

I tell her that my ultimate goal in life is to reach the point of the unattainable 'Stoic Sage' as many of the stoics mention, or the 'perfect man' in terms of stoic principles. But the thing is, she mentions hitler, and if talking about hitler offends you just leave because I'm not gonna deal with that. Her argument is basically that hitler did terrible, awful things, and he'll be remembered forever, and even if I, or someone else were to become the 'Stoic Sage,' we would never really be remembered as well as hitler is remembered. Of course, the people that knew us would remember us and be like: ""oh what a wonderful person he/she was,"" but that's it, that'd be all, only a tight-knit group of people would be 'aware' of us. I understand that it isn't the goal of a stoic to be remembered, but I think my girlfriend's point is something like: ""what's the point of being a stoic and doing good if it's not going to 'amount' to anything or really 'matter' after we're gone?""

Please feel free to ask any questions to clear anything up or if something was confusing. She really got me thinking with this and I wanted to debate it with more knowledgeable people and maybe find some answers for her.

Ignoring texts etc,"What do you do if someone is intentionally ignoring your texts? You’re able to find out through time and deduction that they’re doing it intentionally as a form of disrespect or to test you.
Would a stoic just accept the insult and move on and do nothing? What if you wanted something from the person like a relationship or information of some kind. On a broader note, what if someone directly verbally insults you? 
What would it mean if you insult someone back for insulting you? Or if you insult someone for intentionally ignoring you, and then moving on, instead of just moving on.  Is that considered narcissistic, immature etc? 
Is wanting a relationship from someone, or information or anything else from someone against stoicism to begin with? Should we not want information?

As an example, this college friend I hadnt been in touch with for a while.  I reached out to him to find out where he takes his car for car repair work. I was desperate at the time, because a few mechanic shops i had tried were obvious scams. So i was getting in touch with people, asking them where they take their cars for work.
This guy didnt answer my text, and i forgot about it but then followed up maybe a month or 6 weeks later thinking maybe he was busy or forgot etc.

Still no answer, so maybe a few days later, I sent him whatsapp voicemails of my good crazy friend pretending to eat girls shit and sniff farts.  I think I also made insulting comments about his wifes small boobs. 
He read my messages and blocked me the same day. I felt satisfied with the outcome, I felt that since he wasnt going to help me with my questions anyway, We aren’t really friends, and I might as well say whatever I want to him.  

If I didn’t do this, and just left things as is and ignored him, if I ran into him in person, he would have acted all friendly, formal, and fake. I’m not into maintaining a fake relationship. Clearly we aren’t friends, so I see no need to attempt to maintain a fake relationship where he ignored my question but then acts formal in person.  Of course you also have to consider if you work in the same industry, have a lot of mutual friends and may cross paths again. In some cases you can’t really afford to do this and basically have to move on for your own good. But in some cases you can do it, if you’re sure you won’t need the person, and it’s more satisfying than just letting them ignore you.",Stoicism,1657980310.0,t3_w0hg1z,0.43,0

Was I right to do this?,"I am a student and this happened a few days ago.   
I kept my bag on a seat in the bus at 4:00PM, our school buses leave at around 4:30PM. I got off the bus to talk to my friends. When I came back before the bus was about to start, I saw a stranger sitting at the place where I kept the bag and the bag was pushed to a seat adjacent to it.

I felt that this act of displacing or even touching others' belongings is morally inappropriate. Despite that I did not confront this person and quietly sat at another seat. 

Was I right doing this? Should I have confronted the person? 

I personally don't have a problem adjusting myself to avoid confrontation. But this one bugged me as I felt that I just gave up on something that I 'had' and that I was weak in not going out and telling this stranger to move.

Stoicism and capitalist employment: is it a case of slavery and how to respond to it virtuosly?,"Greetings to everyone!

Several open questions to you fellow students of stoicism:

1) is not modern day precarious work (subsitence-level employment when you are not an ""enterpreneur"" or self-employed) basically akin to voluntary or debt-slavery of Antiquity in principle?
2) would not it be dispreffered and/or wrong to enslave ourselves and others even if you would posses the means to do so (private ownership of capital in the first place)?
3) should we not forget that the notion of freedom (libertas/eleuteria) in Antiquity implied not being employed and/or owned by other persons which means at least material subsitence-level freedom from debt and possession of means to survive materially?
4) should we not consider the stoic self-mastery and sagehood as necessary also economically cooperative and non-exploitational way of life regardless of historical context (whether Antiquity or capitalist present)?

Marcus Aurelius teaches to not complain; I kinda disagree.,"The quote goes ""Don't be overhead complaining... not even to yourself"" -Marcus Aurelius, 8.9.  

Complaining is all about emotional expression. when an emotion is dominating your mind it becomes easy to become hopeless, and feel like you cannot fix the problem. When you vent out this emotion (complaining is an easy way to do that), it allows your brain to operate clearly and it removes that burden from your mind. So id wager it's more beneficial to complain in moderation than to not most of the time. Also, from my experience it's a great ice breaker, an easy way to relate to other people, and often doesn't come off as annoying.

What becomes of stoicism if it turns out that free will doesn't exist?,"More and more major neuroscientists, behavioral scientists, physicists, and philosophers are coming out in agreement that free will simply *cannot* exist, and (here I'm loosely paraphrasing Sabine Hossenfelder) if you think it does exist, then you simply don't understand science.

The crux is: Does stoicism become obsolete if it is proven that free will doesn't exist?

My attempt to respond to Biden's student loan forgiveness like a stoic,"This isn't about politics.

I found myself slightly annoyed that I don't qualify for student loan forgiveness which was just announced in the U.S.

I make just a little bit too much to qualify, but I still have student loans to pay off.

Now, I made good decisions about my education. I didn't go to an expensive school and I chose a degree that would get me a decent paying job, rather than follow my passion which would have likely ended in poverty.

Meanwhile, some theatre/creative arts major drop out who racked up a ton of debt at an expensive school, or some English major who can't get a job is getting bailed out of his poor life choices (nothing against the arts, etc...).

My second, more stoic response to this situation is that it is still better to be me than that person getting bailed out, even if it doesn't seem 100% fair.

The best revenge is to not be like them - not that they did anything to me personally (besides take my tax dollars).

While this falls short of compassion, it seems like an effective response to all manner of recipients of relief, government handouts, etc where the bad situations they are in could be attributed, at least partially, to the choices of the individuals themselves.

Rather than blaming them for their faults which we don't control, we can focus on reinforcing the virtues we have that allow us to be better off, and being grateful for them.

From there, we can work towards compassion without judgement and consider all the things that are not in our control that may have made the difference for us.

The Stoics need a symbol. What should it be?,"The Stoics need a symbol that immediately identifies them as a way of life. The Christians have the cross, Muslims the crescent, Jews the star of David. Many eastern religions have symbols, such as the yin-yang for Taoism. What should the Stoic symbol be, something that unites and immediately identifies the Stoic community?

I was inspired by Epictetus's line that ""everything has two handles by which it may be borne."" That is, there is always a way to bear something in such a way that it becomes an advantage, or a source of strength and character. As Marcus says, *it is not a burden to suffer this, but good fortune to be able to bear it like a good man*. Could the Stoic symbol be a pot with two handles?

"I hate the fact that some people have won in life by being rich doing what they love. e.g streamers, YTubers, Artists, Athletes etc and the rest of us are just NPCs. here in this world mostly for the purpose of making the rich and famous more rich and famous.","
Ok that last sentence was taking it too far and not really the topic of this post but i sometimes i feel like that.

They are exceptions tho, Doctors, and scientists to me are the only normal professions where i actually regard them higher than any Elite and have no envy and jealousy towards them even tho some of them are rich. Why ? mostly because their job is fulfilling and purposeful their success and money is well deserved, that's why I dont envy them. A society without scientists and doctors would be a terrible sight to see.

But when it comes to the aforementioned vocations, to me a streamer that sits in front of his computer and film themselves and gets  $60M to upto $100M deals its just downright depressing to me. And i hate that instead of being happy for them like most people im just a hater simply because it wasn't me gettig that money. Clearly they have won in life and i didn't. 

What's interesting is that if i was rich i wouldn't be doing much different from what im doing now which is just staying in my house taking care of my brothers kids while he work. However if i were rich i would be able to do what i desired the most in life(right after my familys health) and that is setting up my mom, dad and brother for life. Have them have an easier life by living off my money yet here i am living off my brothers money. Bc im a 29 yo dude with severe mental illness that destroyed my life in my teens. I have severe social anxiety and mild hypochondria. 

But besides SA i have a lot of regrets in my life. I had the opportunity to date two of the hottest girls in school ( 3 if i count one that had one of the best glow up ive ever seen, but by that time i was either out of high school or knees deep in SA, cant remember).but anyway, i was always a timid dude with girls i liked even wayyy before i developed SA.(i was an extrovert) 

i another regret was not taking education/school/English as a second language seriously(it lead me to having very poor communication skills in terms of vocabulary, quick wits, intelligent talks etc. i basically sound like a 8 year old even in my own mother language; Spanish. For reference I have been living in the states since i was 10 and i can barely have short conversation without sounding like i just started learning English a few months ago.( Ive been trying to read more books-- last two i read was The Stand and Perfume: the story of a murderer--to improve that but that don't really help me speak, besides all my vocab goes out the window when im in the spot. SA deff has an impact on that.) 
And btw im 100 sure i have no learning disability  or low iq. if there's one thing i remember about my dad in my childhood was him being proud of me for my cleverness/savyness when I was really young.

Let me throw this out there too, I started balding pretty young at around 16yo. that did a number on my insecurities too but what started my SA was my insecurities about my feet( they are or at least were back then a bit big but most fat, I got very insecure about my feet and to make long story short that developed into SA.

 Anyways i dont want to make this longer than it has to. This is mostly me trying to do something to feel a little better at the moment ( the terminology espcapes me). It's 3am and its been 2 hours since i got to our new place which took 5 hours to get here. Me and my sister in laws brother did the whole moving(brother was working at his new job in the hospital) we got up at 4am and got here at 1230am. All i could think was man i wish i was rich so my life would be easier even tho i know i have it way better than a shit ton of ppl especially those kids dying of painful cancer as we speak.

Superiority question,"When you look around in the world, and on the Internet, social media, personal experiences etc you see that the vast majority of people don’t really have morals.  Countless examples of people looting, stealing, destroying, killing, raping.   Countless examples of people being greedy, not donating money. Examples of people physically attacking someone because of something that was verbally said. I think most people, if they could attain a billion dollars in exchange for killing a billion people, most people would probably take that offer and live that life of luxury and have no regrets.

So taking all that into account and being a stoic, having superior morals etc, how can you help but not feel superior to the average person? Just being unwilling to steal or rape or attack someone, even if you have an opportunity to do it, essentially makes you superior to probably 90%+ of the human population currently. The value of a person can only be determined by their character, morals, actions etc. it can’t be based on looks, wealth, fame, or anything superficial.

Stoicism debunks Christian view afterlife.,"Although the followings are my own findings, they are possible not without similarities with other's.

My Background: I was raised in a very religious, christian family (my grandfather was an orthodox priest), and I was in a religious high school. Last year I found Stoicism, via /r/noFap/, via CBT. Last autumn I ""deconversed"". I've always had certain problems with the christian worldview, but they were not so serious. I've always been a heretic... But last October I turned around. 

So.

Christian afterlife has two (three) possibilities. 
Hell, (Purgatory), Heaven. Let's focus on Hell.

Hell means ""unhappiness"" while heaven means Happiness. 
The mainstream meaning of Hell is ""Eternal life withouth the presence of God"" (*or the old-school meaning is eternal torture* ...). 
So I am a prokopton, I will die without accepting Jesus as my savior/messiah/salvation. So, I will get an eternal punishment for my earthly, temporal sins. (*This is not justice if you ask me btw...*). But I have my consciousness, or how could I experience the pain/suffering without it?  So, According to Stoic teaching, One can attain happiness in **any** circumstances. Assume, I am lying in the torture chamber, but I have the possibility to choose my ""thoughts, and judgments"", cause I will have my consciousness. In the same time I would have an infinite time to attain tranquility even during torture.

Other possibility is that God/Evil will prevent me to choose my own thoughts. But in that case, Who or What I would be? Who would experience the pain? I would be in that case as an automaton, animal or green-vegetable....

*In my worldview, I am not my thoughts: I am the one who can choose what to think, or what kind of judgement to make in any case.*

So I think it is not reasonable to suspend my own (*certainly imperfect*) sense of reason/justice/philanthropy/wisdom in this earthly life to favor some transcendent Entity. 

What do you think about that? I've read so many times that Christianity is very compatible with stoicism, but I think, they are very far from each other. (Except in the meaning of some practical morality.)

Stoicism says: ""You can be happy on your own, you can have a good meaningful life without any outer help, or gifts, in any circumstances.""

Christianity says: ""Only by my help, with my Gift/Sacrifice can you attain (eternal) Happiness. Every one else is pure evil."" ",Stoicism,1453553171.0,t3_42apv6,0.5,0

As a Stoic, brotherhood and unity are things I believe we should have. However, under capitalism its all about money and selfishness. No one can be virtuous when their main goals are to hoard money and maximize profit.

The new Stoicism is a kind of victor’s wisdom. It simplifies the lives of people who are beset with extreme surplus. This is not a universal problem. Modern Stoics should not pretend to universal (or even broad) relevance. “Very little is needed to make a happy life”, wrote Marcus Aurelius, the ultimate owner of everything in the known world at the time.

"I (18M) want to ask out my friend (19F), but she's sexual with someone else, I need advice.","Quick backstory, I've been into stoicism on and off for the past year but have really gotten into it the past 2 or so months. 

During this time I also fell in love for the first time in my life. 

The type of love where I don't even think of the other person sexually and want to get into a relationship to hold hands and talk about TV shows.  

Lately, by the virtue of stoic reflection I've come to realize holding off on telling her for the reason of ""getting better to impress her"" is a foolish one, and so I made up my mind to ask her out by the end of the year. 

Right now, I've got one try of that under my belt. 

It happened 2 days ago, and with as much preparation as I had, nearly a week of stoic reflection, recounting, and writing I still didn't manage to ask her out.

Now, the problem is she's sexually active with another guy, so I'm almost sure to get rejected.

Should I follow the virtue of honesty and tell her how I feel, as I've been depriving her of this fact, and try asking her out, or should I just accept the fact that she is in a ""relationship"" and move on with my life?

This feels like an opportunity to express great virtue, courage for getting the confidence necessary, justice for the honesty required, and moderation in keeping the whole thing grounded and not too over the top, but is it worth it over just accepting that getting into a relationship with her is out of my control and continuing my life?

I'm quite young and new to philosophy, so I thought I'd reach out for help.

Stoicism is more like a religion than a self help book,"For those of you who frequent this sub and find a lot of the discussions here rather lacking. It’s because most of the people posting here are not Stoic.  

They have simply picked a few ideas from Stoicism and adopted them for whatever reason. 

Stoicism is an ancient philosophy. 
It’s not a self help book. 

It’s not “tips”. 
It’s more like a religion. 

Stoicism, inherent in it, is a very specific world view and more importantly world belief. 

Without that world belief, and adherence to metaphysical ideas such as Virtue is the ultimate truth and is the natural order of the universe, and fate is a real force. 

If you want to understand Stoicism, then you will find no better teacher than Epictetus. 

Read or listen to the original audiobooks and you will instantly understand what real Stoicism is.

Stoicism vs Black Lives Matter,"It's incontrovertibly true that black lives matter, but a decentralized political organization calling itself ""Black Lives Matter"" has hijacked that phrase and I can't see how it's virtuous.

Stoics repeatedly counsel people to turn away from the passions and emotions which dictate their actions, but Black Lives Matter encourages the opposite, inculcating a deep anger and resentment towards police and government. The Stoics said that such approaches were ""against nature."" What they meant was that the emotions would cloud one's judgement, obscure the truth, and likely result in self-defeating actions.

Yes it's insanely controversial right now, but Stoics should stand up for what's right no matter the cost. Working class black neighborhoods have a high crime rate. Defunding police and alienating police from the neighborhoods they are supposed to protect is not going to help working class blacks; it's going to increase crime and keep those neighborhoods in poverty for years to come. That's an obvious outcome which reinforces the Stoic reliance on Reason over emotion.

Using Reason and ignoring emotion, we might be able to see that the most successful emancipation and ciivil rights movements of the previous century were led by Gandhi and MLK. If there is really something at stake here, nonviolence and reconciliation will obviously be far more effective at generating a desired outcome than looting and alienation. If we really want police brutality against blacks to end, let's have block parties where the police are invited, where they get to hang out with their fellow citizens they are assigned to protect.

Accomplished Stoics shouldn't get riled up in the midst of any of this. They should be a calm voice of reason and guide the different parties towards reconciliation. To the extent that one party or the other can't accept reconciliation, they're too emotional to create a beneficial outcome, and can be safely ignored.",Stoicism,1602466066.0,t3_j9hpxz,0.46,0

I was really wondering how do individuals with maybe ADHD or Maladaptive daydreaming or OCD approach the stoic methods? 

To be honest, stoic techniques have helped me a lot with dealing with negative thoughts and taking responsibility. But I struggle a lot with discipline although I have been successful with having some structure. But usually my mind is a battle ground, i fall back on reveries or my coping mechanisms that I've known for long. Also when i challenge my mind too much with pushing discipline excessively I tend to have severe depressive or anxiety related episodes.

sex and stoicism,"i feel so much jealousy hearing about people 's sexual experiences ,  it feels like they are discovering things and i am not ,about themselves.this frustration was worse when someone i liked kissed someone else .
for context i have 0 experiences,never even had a kiss. had some people ask me out ,but never accepted.
i read somewhere that stoicism advices against sleeping around.and saving everything for marriage,and even my religion states the same thing .and that s what i plan to do.
but i can't help but question if i am making wrong choices here. ifeel so much jealousy seeing people my age partying and having fun while i feel like a recluse (nothing new).
i do believe that it makes it more intimate if you share your first everything with the person you are gonna marry.
I think it s not fair to them to think about an ex you fucked in the past while you are in a marriage. i think it devalues what a marriage is ,and what love is .it s about the notion of:you are the only person i love ,and  it  turns it into""i love you ,but you are just one of the 100 of experiences i have had with people,so nothing special here"".
 i just think what makes life valuable to a  person is how they think of things. and if you don t value things like human connection,sex,kids  ,then what is left?

/r/Stoicism on /r/TheRedPill?,"**TL;DR**: [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/28dxl5/being_controlling_is_for_losers/) has made me wonder whether /r/TheRedPill is Stoic-inclined. What do you think?

*as much as i hate to bring back a ""what would the Stoics think about ice cream"" thread ...*

Long version: In the comments on this sub, I've seen one or two semi-favorable references to /r/TheRedPill. Nothing frequent, but still enough to confuse me, since TRP is notoriously horrible. It gets dissed on SRS and 2XChromosomes all the time. I never really investigated this cognitive dissonance.

That changed last night, when I stumbled across /r/RedPillWomen via /r/DarkEnlightenment. Like, what? Why would almost 10k females be involved in a pickup art community? And then I started reading the top posts on that sub and /r/TheRedPill, which led me to a few very very interesting posts, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/25q7ld/the_red_pill_is_prowoman/) and (more importantly) [this one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/28dxl5/being_controlling_is_for_losers/)

>Many detractors of The Red Pill find the men who subscribe to this body of information to be “controlling.” Nothing could be farther from the truth. The Red Pill promotes something that’s not immediately obvious at first: the complete abdication of any attempt to control anything, except for the one thing you can actually control. Yourself.

Needless to say, I'm internally conflicted. Now I've done my research, TRP doesn't seem that bad to me. Frankly, it seems a lot like a Stoic approach to modern courting and relationships, bundled with some masculine perspective (which, frankly, I consider [much-needed](http://abcnews.go.com/2020/Entertainment/story?id=1526982) in [today's society](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/01/untitled/)). But if that's all it is, then why does it have such a bad rep? I just want to understand.

Under my many past accounts, I've learned to trust the /r/Stoicism community, so now I turn to you once more. Do *you* perceive the Red Pill as a particularly Stoic philosophy? Why? Or why not?

We modern practitioners now hold on to useless ideas and stupid beliefs just because they were once respected.,"It has to be said 

The point of philosophy is to useful, and purposefully, and applicable. If not, then we spend our time perfecting useless ideas and values. 

All to often on this sub have I seen people holding on to old ideas written by former stoics with the idea that it must hold some value. So much so that they will quickly say “well if you don’t believe that, then maybe stoicism isn’t your thing!” Or “that’s not what the stoics believe!” We are seeing things that are not there. 

Stoicism wants to find the best way to live a good life, a life of virtue, right? We are committed to truth, are we not?

Then what purpose does things like Cosmic Cycles, or world cycles, or anything of the matter that was truthfully a bunch of mumbo jumbo from ancients with ancient ideas. 

Due to the lack of a functional and practical Stoa, the ideas we have kept alive have still continued to atrophy. 

Stoicism was created with the common man in mind. Those that wanted good and practical wisdom to structure their life. It’s time we bring back that sentiment and clean house.

Everything has to be on the table to view with strict scrutiny. Or we will be no wiser than the people we respected so much, even after all this time.

Is Stoicism a good idea?,"Hello friends,

I'm currenty on a binge reading streak on men/women relationships and feminism and now i'm in the middle of  ""How can i get through to you"" by Terry Real. Not gonna lie i think every man should read it but that's not my point but it got me thinking about stoicism. Especially those lines :

*""When i first began looking at gender issues, I believed that violence was a by-product of boyhood socialization. But after listening more closely to men and their families, I have come to believe that violence is boyhood socialization. The way we 'turn boys into men' is through injury. We sever them from theirs mothers, research tells us, far too early. We pull them awway from their own expressiveness, from their feelings, from sensitivity to others. The very phrase ' Be a man' means suck it up and keep going. Disconnection is not fallout from traditional masculinity. Disconnection is masculinity""*

My reflexion is : As men, is stoicism the ""right"" philosophy to follow?  Shouldn't we follow a philosophy that try to reconnect us with our emotions even if the reconnection could be chaotic in the first time?

any advice for lost incel,"24M who identifies as incel, I recognize how bad of a mentality incel shit is, but through out my day I always find it to be true which strengthens my belief in it.

when I first found the redpill/incel theories and stuff, I didn't really believe it, but when I tested one or two of their theories and seeing it was true I was more curious and decided to find out how much of what they say is right.

the 1st thing that made me believe in redpill stuff was the idea of ignoring girls to attract them, I thought that contacting a girl everyday asking about her day, showing interest and acting nice to her will make her like me but when I tried the redpill approach by ignoring her for a week, it worked, she became the one to initiate small talks.

I followed more redpill advice, it was like magic, something like a chemistry equation, do X or say Y and girls will react to it in this Z way 100% of the time.

I had many female friends at the time, I integrated myself into their circles and their chats (no person in my life suspects that I'm an incel) and I was shocked by the way they talked about guys, everything redpill/incel guys said about women were true, they are more superficial than men, they HATE and I mean HATE short guys, you have no idea , some girls who had tall handsome boyfriends can't keep their mouths closed, they need to make fun of the short dudes for exisiting , even if he's minding his buisness, not even approaching them.

With time the incel belief became undeniable, like once you see it you cannot unsee it. I can't now communicate with a girl/woman without thinking about the horrible things she thinks of me ( cause I'm 5'7).

And what fuels me is that in public situation they play angels and deny all that, I was convinced that girls are indeed evil by nature.

some part of me knows that hating the other gender aka half the society is ridiculous and super wrong, but I can't help but be reminded by what I heard and saw.

The very Stoic (capital 'S') John McCain,"The following is from the third chapter of the late U.S. Senator's final memoir, titled: ""The Restless Wave"". The chapter’s topic is the CIA’s use of torture to interrogate enemy combatants after the Sept 11, 2001, attacks, and the torture he himself suffered as a POW during the Vietnam War:  
 
    “Some might read this and say to themselves, ‘Who gives a damn about what happened to a terrorist after what they did on Sept 11?’. But it’s not about them. Never was.    

     ""What makes us exceptional? Our wealth? Our natural resources? Our military power? Our big, bountiful country? No. Our founding ideals, and our fidelity to them at home and in our conduct in the world make us exceptional. They are the source of our wealth and power: living under the rule of law; facing threats with confidence that our values make us stronger than our enemies; acting as an example to other nations of how free people defend their liberty without sacrificing the moral conviction upon which it is based; respect for the dignity possessed by all God's children, even our enemies. This is what made us the great nation we are.

     ""My fellow POWs and I could work up very intense hatred for the people who tortured us. We cussed them, made up degrading names for them, swore we would get back at them some day. That kind of resistance, angry and pugnacious, can only carry you so far when your enemy holds most of the cards and hasn't any scruples about beating the resistance out of you, however long it takes. Eventually, you won't cuss them. You won't refuse to bow. You won't swear revenge.

     “Still, they can't make you surrender what they really want from you: your assent to their supremacy. No, you don't have to give them that, not in your heart. And your last resistance, the one that sticks, the one that makes the victim superior to the torturer, is the belief that were the positions reversed, you wouldn't treat them as they have treated you. The ultimate victim of torture is the torturer, the one who inflicts pain and suffering at the cost of their humanity.""

Today's PSA: You are NOT responsible for things you did in the past,"# IT. WAS. NEVER. YOUR. FAULT.

It's not rocket science. You did what you did because you could NOT know any better.

Stop blaming yourself. Stop shaming yourself, stop torturing yourself. You had enough. We all had.

We are not at fault.

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Apparently this needs more spelling out.

We *cannot* be held responsible for our past choices because they are neither *ours*, nor they are *choices*.  They were determined exclusively by the experiences we happened to end up with. Leaving *no room* for ""free will"", or anything else of our choice.

The ""free will"" is just an illusion, our way to rationalize the deeply irrational feeling of guilt and shame about our past actions. And yes, it means that the very concept of *punishment* is simply WRONG.

here’s the thing: we’ve been speaking for hours a day for 5 months straight.

that sexual online stuff happened along the way. but i realized she hasn’t shared as much as me. just two pics of her face. she has explicit pics of me.

now she doesn’t wanna tell me why she wouldn’t share with me and claims to have shared with others. but not me because it’s “irrational” and what we have together is “deeper”

I won't be a vegan.,"My teenage daughter and I completed a life experiment this month.  We went full on vegan.  I learned sooo much about veganism, especially about it's ethical and moral  stance.  My first reaction was that this seemed closely related to Stoicisms ideal of our interdependent nature with the world.   I had that beautiful warming of my heart.  But as the month went on, I began noticing in the vegan subreddit, the majority of the shares were meant to shame people into their viewpoint.  In my experience, shaming is a form of causing suffering onto others.  I've also found it one of the least effective methods of changing people's behavior.

I have found my body feeling extremely energized from switching away from dairy.  I wasn't a big meat eater before.  I will most likely order at restaurants as a vegan for simplicity, but won't be calling myself a vegan.

my problems with modern stoicism,"The problem with modern stoicism is that it doesnt lead to changes in your behaviour. Only changes in your thoughts. Even modern day philosophers like Stefan Molyneux from freedomainradio and Tyler Durden from real social dynamics fame give more practical advice. 

Now logically, changes in thoughts should lead to changes in behaviour. If you dont care what people think about you then you interact with them differently. 

Another thing that bothers me is that stoicism is too close to slave morality. Epictetus story about his master twisting his leg until it broke. Why not resist, surely its in your control. Why doesnt he fight not only his master but slavery in general, rather than be a good slave.


I started thinking about this after reading the introduction to ""A guide to the good life"". The author said that back in the ancient days you could clearly see what school of philosophy people belonged to by their actions and even by how they looked.

But its impossible to point out a stoic from a non stoic just by looking at him. Changing your philosophy should lead to changing your life. And it seems that the philosophy stoicism was based on did just that. 

For example there are no cynics in the military. But there are plenty of stoics. And if you can be a philosopher and a thug for hire at the same time then your philosophy isnt worth much. 


Now changing your thoughts has value but it should lead to changes in your action. 

I need practical lifestyle advice. What good is atheism if you still go to church after becoming an atheist. 

This might be a problem just with modern stoicism. The definition of a stoic these days seems to be: ""A man who reads Marcus Aurelius""

I thought stoicism was about virtue. If you dont change your life then how much more virtous can you have become.
The consequence of putting virtue above everything else is that you will get fired from most jobs. Just look at Patrice O'neal. He was a stand up comedian. Couldn't catch a break despite being the funniest man of all time because he valued honesty above everything else. 

Now perhaps the olden stoics did change their lives drastically but modern stoicism is a joke. For example, religion is the antithesis of philosophy. We have christian stoics. Need I say more. 


A further problem: stoicism is used by evil men to justify their actions, ""Just doing my duty"". How vey stoic of you. 

Changing your thoughts can be of great benefit, but only if action follows.

I find arrogant/know it all people to be so incredibly cringe and obtuse, but I can’t help but start to feel that way about myself. Stoicism has changed my life in such a dramatic way, that I can’t help but feel like I know a secret to life that everyone else is ignorant to…and my ego insists on telling me I must be such a special snowflake for possessing the knowledge few others have. I find myself impulsively preaching to others about stoicism and I feel gross after the fact(I will gladly talk about it to those who like to talk philosophy, but others don’t care).


The rational part of me knows I’m not special, or better than anyone else…and I’d really like to develop a sense of natural humility to bring myself back to ground level.

"How would a stoic deal with a next door neighbor's barking dogs that bark randomly and heavily throughout every day, all daylight hours?","How would a stoic deal with a next door neighbor's barking dogs that bark randomly and heavily throughout every day, all daylight hours?  The constant barking is similar to someone honking their car horn every day, off and on throughout the day.

I already tried to communicate with the neighbor 2 times, and he believes it is his right to have the barking dogs in his yard.

After over a year of tolerating this, I finally involved the police because there is city ordinance against heavily barking dogs.  The day after, the neighbor gave me attitude, and he seemed to keep the 2 dogs inside most of the day so it was much quieter, and he seems to be testing the waters to see how much he can ""get away"" with his dogs barking, even after police involvement.  Also he remote-honks his car horn several times throughout the day, and tonight he honked his car horn repeatedly about 7 times (by pushing a button on his key fob for emergency, and he locks his car with the horn honking and remote starts his car with the horn honking.  He's a total noise maker.  Would you repeatedly involve the police?

Being humble isn't a quality,"I know that it's out of my control when others ""praise"" me for being humble. I've been partially practicing stoicism for years, but now I have embraced its purpose and made things more clear.

I don't see being humble as a quality. It's only logical and reasonable. When I say to people, ""By the way, don't take what I say to heart and check after everything I say because I am not all knowing."" People find that humble.

It's not humble it's logical. I understand that others see it as a quality, but even when I try to refute it by saying, ""I am just stating a fact,"" it only backfires into more compliments.

I honestly don't know how to respond. Stoicism teaches us that others' opinions about us don't matter, but our ego is a real thing, and I have to squash it every time I receive a compliment. 

I rationalize it in my head and not worry about it, but it's frustrating to deal with because it's extra work on my part. I'd rather take insults instead.

MINUS $46.13 BANK ACCOUNT AND NEVER FELT BETTER,"Dear All,

If money is what your seeking, your life will surely be confused. Trust me, I was once a only paper chasing machine. And this state of mind led me to follow a boring pyramid scheme company/ get ez money business/ i don't want to work hard but wants lots of money kind of attitude. And this is what happens within the same year of trying to follow others and figuring out how to make money easily.

 I end up losing money, respect, and worked the hardest in my life doing meaningless things that I believe is going to get me $$ rich. This was a big nono. I would work hard day time and drink and party night time with friends and rinse and repeat. It was cruel. I didn't enjoy the moment at my job, I didn't enjoy the moment with my friends. It was like being in hell doing things I don't like and then at night trying to escape hell by downing insane amount of alcohol as a competition among friends. Pure collegery. I made that up as a drunkie college student. Obviously no time is every wasted. Some are still my close friends today. 

This is why I hope this letter can help change many peoples state of mind and thinking and help get my comrades to where they belong, Nirvana in this Earth. When I say this, I don't mean some angelic person that preaches love to everyone and is oblivious of malicious things. No, we know this earth is heaven and hell at the same time. What I mean is, you should be happy being alive, waking up, seeing the colors, feeling the fresh breeze, feeling good and have a greater sense of control and belonging with this earth. Which everyone already is. 

 Lets start with questions. Why were you created? What is your purpose? When someone asked the latter question, I would say I don't know what is my purpose. Then let me ask you another question. What is the purpose of human being?  
Is it not to help the human race? Is it not to help and love each other. Does it not benefit all human beings from one human discovery. Are we infact indebted to one another without laws guiding us and just our reasons?   
Don't we need each other? Aren't we all categorically the same? These are all questions I have answered and pondered throughout my young adult to adult life. 

So few years ago,  i believed what many of my comrades that I went to school with believed, which was- go to college, get a degree, get a good job, and then your set for life. Once I have enough $$ saved, I was like I am going to start a business because I will have the knowledge and skills. That was my inside voice telling me, everything is going to be allright as long as i get my degree. That was indeed going to be false, because there is much more in life than degree/ than company/ than, dare I say, money.  If you think false, you are surely mistaken. And you will find that out eventually. Because your mom is free and I don't mean it in a nasty bullying you online kind of way I mean your mom cost nothing and yet she is everything for you. 

These all sounds like a big mumbo jumbo positive things that mainstream guru says. 

But pay attention, those gurus aren't lying. There is truth to being positive. Recently, I would say couple months ago, my feelings of change came first with curiosity of positive people and gurus. What is the point of that feeling? Is so gay, i thought. Why be ignorant? Why be happy? Don't you see who is the president and what is happening around the world?! But I decided to try it anyway, lets be positive in everything for few days. What happened to my mood and energy blew my mind. In being positive, I discovered extra bit of patience, extra bit of hardwork, and lots and lots of good energy. While my fellow comrades were down in their dumps, their bodies slouched and head low, my chest was up I had a laughter/smirk on my face and felt that I had a greater purpose to my life. Then that is why I avoid all negative shits today and consume only positive things. 

Now let me go back to the amount of dollars up there. That is my bank account today. Am I depressed? Am I sad? That I can't even afford a piece of tootsie roll? hahah

No, I am not. I am actually quite content, happy and grateful today. I Am grateful for my mom, my view of this world I live, and the coffee on my desk. I know that today is minus 46 dollars tommorow will be something else I guarantee it.   
The point is, $$ doesn't really make me feel anything. Its there for exchanges of service and goods. Although, I probably need to get better at my spendings considering I can pay all my necessities expense in 1 weeks pay. I realize that things are temporary. In this case this is only for today but tomorrow my bank account will have enough to do as I please. 

Now what do i please, I please to serve others. I got this from Daniel H. PInk ""Adventures of Johnny Bunko"" relatively a short read but packs a valuable lesson for all young adults and adults, for everyone actually. We are here to serve others. 

This desire to serve others and actually help is what gets my engine going. That is why from now on, nothing is impossible, everything is within my grasp. I am happy. I am healthy. I don't have a need to desire ridiculous amount of $$. I can be happy doing things I like and being a better person and having that desire to help others without any incentive. Before I end this, I would like my reader to know that when you change your mind and your current self, all things break lose. For me changing to being positive and non confrontational person caused many related occurrences to happen in my life which could have caused me to be quite the opposite. I would be tested like i just entered another invisible barrier that wasn't there before now approaches to me to go through me or push me back. I describe it as Murphys law. 

Anyways, I hope all you broke comrades today can take delight that all is well, and what we worry the most is really our imaginations of those incidents that can have thousands of diff. scenarios. 

Thank you.

She has this issue of cutting things off when she feels very hurt and overwhelmed. The past few times when she called off what we are into, I convinced her (She very well wanted me to try harder because according to her, if a guy needs a girl, he must be ready to move mountains for her) so I did everything in my power to work things out. But I'm not gonna blame her, poor thing, she has strong attachment issues and the acceptance of her being attached to me took a long time for her. The funny part is, even it's the same shit for me. I had to mentally accept the fact that I'm attached to her and make myself feel okay with it because I hate being attached to anyone except for my family. but this girl changed everything for me. I've been in past relationships where it had to end cuz I wasn't emotionally invested because I don't attach myself. But this was like karma to me, she wanted to end things because of attachment fear.

the reason she gives for ending things with me this time is, I mean every time is, she is in a dark place, she is mentally not in a good place. She ain't lying cuz she has a peculiar character where she deliberately makes her feel sad. She doesn't really take care of herself, she has a bad diet, and bad sleep and takes zero measures to change but whines that she has bad health. She has no purpose yet the person holds strong values. Her only purpose to live is for her father who is diagnosed with Parkinson's. sometimes she says she'd end her life right after her dad's last breath. She is extremely attractive and gets a hell of a lot of attention yet she is the most insecure I've ever seen. I like her cuz she's funny, I'm attracted to her, my day lights up when I talk to her and she takes massive efforts for me (she travels 8-9hrs just to come to see me) yet deep down, I'd sometimes have trouble with the too much attachment. 

Now I guess I've given a small gist of our mindset. So she called me last night and said she wants to call it off. She cries that she tried, she tried all these times to be okay with what we have but she says her negativity is a slow poison and I'm affected by it. (actually to some extent, yes but I like her) She says she's ending things for me cuz her mental state will ruin everything that we have and my peace. She wanted us to end in good terms, when we look back she wants me to be happy but I don't want to give that to her cuz I want a win so I fought and called it quits. Additional information: Everytime she wanted to end things when we fought for some issue, her way of solving the issue is to end things.

I didn't take it well this time. I said some hurtful things and ended which perplexed her cuz she kinda expected me to try a bit maybe? IDK what to do. I'm a stoic, I don't seek pleasure and I've been reading stoic literature for a while now. A part of me wants me to take this as an opportunity to improve myself but all I do is see this as a reason to waste my life, smoke cigs, get drunk and jerk off. and another part of me wants to work things with her, I cannot leave her during this tough times, cuz I know very well I will not find a girl like her but I don't know, I feel she could drag me down but I love her.

Do you think Stoicism is compatible with weightlifting?,"I almost don't want to link them together because Stoic philosophy tends to focus on how to deal with people more than building muscle, but some major Stoic concepts seem to me to be very in line with weightlifting success. Just an example, think of Diogenes. He himself was a Cynic, but the ancient Stoics did admire him. The dude was known to embrace frozen statues in winter. So pain tolerance... Very useful in weightlifting.

Suicide is immoral,">Since I've never intentionally harmed another, what right have I to injure myself?

I came across the above passage in [Meditations (annotated in the stoic group on CommonPlace, post your annotations there as well if you are reading stoic texts)](https://apple.co/3GiOfic) and it reminded me of what GK Chesterton wrote about suicide. He wrote:

>Not only is suicide a sin, it is *the* sin. It is the ultimate and absolute evil, the refusal to take an interest in existence; the refusal to take the oath of loyalty to life. The man who kills a man, kills a man. The man who kills himself, kills all men; as far as he is concerned he wipes out the world.

Suicide is wrong, we do not have a right to kill ourselves. Although, I will say, I think the GK Chesterton quote can be tempered a bit because, as Seneca points out, *""Sometimes even to live is an act of courage.""* What do others think?",Stoicism,1673275415.0,t3_107g2wg,0.42,0

How do you reconcile Stoicism with toxic masculinity?,"If this sounds like a stupid or antagonistic question, I encourage you not to brush it aside. I think it’s actually one of the more challenging considerations when practicing Stoicism.

I’ve been getting therapy ads showing weathered old men saying “don’t show emotion,” “keep it bottled up,” “man up,” etc. While I know that this isn’t actual Stoicism, I do think the practice of Stoic virtues can be mistaken for this detached invulnerability. Not just from the outside but from within. 

For a healthy example of stoicism: a friend who is new to construction has an old supervisor who’s been giving him a hard time. My advice would be to show no sign of grievance and not take it personally, to consider that this bitter dinosaur is that way because he’s lived a shitty life and is projecting (and that the reward for not engaging is that you get to be the happy young man and he has to keep being the rusty old jerk). Or maybe I could frame it like “you can’t control the old man’s behavior, but you can still find value in the work that you are doing,” or “you can line up another job so the boss’s rants seem silly and pointless to you.” My point is, I don’t think it’s hard to find a stoic rationale to resolve that kind of issue. But this can become your default reaction for dealing with everything, and at a certain point, how is that different from “don’t show emotion,” “hero it bottled up,” “man up.”

I ask because in my life there have been times when I feel like the Stoic answer allowed me to shoulder more than I could bear, but then became it’s own cop out when I should have been more vocal in seeking help, or allowed my emotions to guide more of my behaviors. That the cumulative effect of letting things roll off me was something similar to toxic masculinity, at least as it regards trying to be stronger instead of softer or more vulnerable or emotionally receptive.

It can be exceedingly difficult to identify when is the time to share how you really feel, or let passion guide your actions. 

So how does a Stoic avoid the toxic trait of becoming an emotionally detached strong man type of guy?

Edit: I’m not interested in perspectives of anyone who denies that toxic masculinity is a thing. If you can’t identify toxic masculinity in the world around you, then you aren’t qualified to determine if there can be overlap between Stoicism and TM.",Stoicism,1694587179.0,t3_16hfnc1,0.4,0

Transcript of Stoic Meditation #394, on abstaining from animal slaughter and consumption, and other useless things. 

Seneca:

“For what virtue lies in despising useless things? The time to admire your own conduct is when you have come to despise the necessities. You are doing no great thing if you can live without royal pomp, if you feel no craving for boars which weigh a thousand pounds, or for flamingo tongues, or for the other absurdities of a luxury that already wearies of game cooked whole, and chooses different bits from separate animals”

Massimo Pigliucci:

“Most of us have trouble detaching ourselves from what Seneca correctly labels “useless things” — luxuries of all sorts such as pomp, royal or otherwise, cravings for exotic food that cost much to obtain and cause environmental damage and animal suffering and so on… 

And yet, he’s right, doing without thay sort of thing i’ll be particularly onerous. It is but a small step on the path to virtue. 

Have you taken it it yet?”


Seneca continues:

“I shall admire you only when you have learned to scorn even the common sort of bread, when you have made yourself believe that grass grows for the needs of men as well as of cattle, when you have found out that food from the treetop can fill the belly – into which we cram things of value as if it could keep what it has received. We should satisfy our stomachs without being over-nice. How does it matter what the stomach receives, since it must lose whatever it has received?”

UPDATE:  

Findings in my quest so far:  

1 - Stoics to the rescue: be calm, focus on what you can control (not what you cannot), accept reality but don't be passive , be who you want to be (by acting accordingly), act in the now  

2 - what actions to take? take more control of your destiny (so it does not matter who becomes a president and what he/she does)  

3 - taking control of your destiny in unstable political climate. by empowering your personal flexibility, stamina and ultimately freedom (become as independent of any system as possible)

Misconceptions of Meditation,"I want to correct a creeping misconception I've seen in this subreddit lately:

**Stoicism is *not* about ""meditation"".  Stoicism is about *living* in accord with nature and realizing the truth of what is within your control.**

Understanding just how little is actually in one's control is not an invitation to [be passive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fox_and_the_Grapes) or suffer well; it is a challenge to calmly do all that you can.  This is what makes Stoicism challenging and potentially rewarding.

The only reason the modern idea of meditation seems to be associated with Stoicism is the title of Marcus Aurelius' Stoic masterwork.  There are several major problems with putting any weight in this title:

*  The title almost certainly wasn't his, since scholars believe Marcus never intended publication.  You can probably thank a Byzantine Christian monk for that.
*  The original title in Greek is 'Τὰ εἰς ἑαυτόν' (addressed to himself), with 'Meditations' coming much later as a loose English translation via Latin.
*  ""Meditatio"" - the Latin source of the word ""meditation"" only means ""to reflect or consider"" - nothing philosophical or spiritual is implied.
*  Connotations of the word ""Meditation"" have drifted a lot over the centuries - most notably after the introduction of Eastern philosophy and ""New Age"" thinking to the West.

Aurelius is thoughtful, but most of his entries read like brusk admonitions to do one's duty and get back to reality (see [Pierre Hadot's excellent 'Inner Citadel'](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Inner-Citadel-Meditations-Aurelius/dp/0674007077) for more on the purpose of this).  His contemporaries and modern historians paint a picture of the Emperor as a vigorous man actively engaged with the business of government, justice, and war.  *This* is what philosophy meant to the Stoics; it is a tradition of lived philosophy.

Put another way, if you are in a quiet room room alone with your thoughts (keeping posture and monitoring your breathing, etc.), know that your path - while totally legitimate - has nothing to do with the Marcus' Stoicism.  I wish you well and I recommend the good people at /r/zen or /r/ZenHabits.

As a result, he only wrote positive things, ensuring a good reputation for himself for eternity. However, there are many criticisms of his reign. For example, his adoption of his son Commodus as his successor has been criticized as Commodus was not a capable leader and his reign marked a decline in the Roman Empire's stability and power. This decision also suggests that he wanted to keep power in his own bloodline.

Should running be part of Stoicism?,"For me the core tenet of Stoicism is to live according to nature i.e. as nature has intended humans to be and more specifically what separates us from other things in nature. The Stoics say that what separates us from other things in nature is our reason and the ability to use it, so use reason in everything.

In Christopher McDougall's famous book, 'Born to Run' he positions that humans evolved to run and run more efficiently for longer distances than any other animal, and that that is what separates us from other things in nature. Other anthropologists have also said this and to be more precise that we not only evolved to run, but that we evolved as we did because we ran.

So if running (particularly long-distance running), is in our nature and the Stoics advise us to live in accordance with nature, then should we include the practise of running in Stoicism?

There may be other things that separate us from other things apart from running and reason, that I can't think of, and should they be included in good Stoic practises?",Stoicism,1663022340.0,t3_xcqgdv,0.46,0
How can I apply Stoicism to my gender identity issue.,"For context, I am 23, male. I have been questioning my gender identity for over 4 years now, that means I have doubts about whether or not im a person of transgender experience and since Im not courageous enough to go out in public and experiment I never move anywhere regarding this part of my life. There are others aspect regarding why I have so many doubts and confusing experienced with my ifentity but thats not what Im asking here, I know this is not the place. What im asking is what should I do with this knowledge? I had this thought, that maybe through stoicism I could re-evaluate my feelings or challenge them. For example maybe I can accept what is “real” and that is that I am a man, and just a man, and I can just follow what is expected for me and not challenge the gender norm. I had this thought because of this phrase I heard from Marcus I believe the other day. It was something amongst the line of “you are what you think, what you see, and what you identify as.” I know its poorly worded and I cant recall exactly what It meant. But I understood that maybe throughout my lifes experiences I have led myself to believe that I am transgender, and if thats an opinion then maybe I can change it. But theres also a part of me that wants to instead of neglecting or changing a part of me wants to accept it, once again poorly quoting Marcus, he said something about being true to oneself, that only being authentic can you do your best at life. Im tired of looping around this issue with my life, and I want to tackle it the best way but I know that there are things in the way and that I cant resolve them unless I start practicing being courageous, and challenging myself and ket go of the fears I have of being judged, critized, insulted, I feel I wear a mask, I cant express my honest opinions or be myself in public because I always wanted to be perfect, but I became a shell of who I am and no longer want to keep being this person.

How can the principles of stoicism help when you’ve been ‘friendzoned’ by someone you like?,"Hi all. I am a relatively new student of stoic philosophy, although I have always admired it as it seemed consistent with my own ideas and beliefs. I have been reading a lot of original work’s recent but am looking for some help in sorting through the ideas in this situation because I feel confused and conflicted by many things. The title is pretty straightforward and would probably be enough, but here’s some more context for anyone with time and attention to spare. 

At the end of last semester, I started talking to a girl from one of my classes who was an exchange student who would be going home at the end of the semester so I didn’t think anything would come of it. We met to hang out a few times before she left, and although it was really fun and she was a really cool person, nothing else happened romantically and I thought her leaving would be the end. 
But after she went home, she continued contacting me and we grew really close with daily texting and weekly FaceTime calls. After about 3 months I asked her what was going on, whether we were just friends or something more, because I had started developing stronger feelings. I was disappointed to hear her say she only saw me as a friend, that she hadn’t told me about another guy she was seeing when we started talking, and that she recognized her behavior the last few months had been misleading. But she reiterated how strongly she cared for me and didn’t want to lose me as a friend. 
I told her I needed some space and after a week of no contact she texted asking how I was. Since then we have been talking fairly regularly. In fact, she is almost more talkative than she was before. But there are times we go a day or two without talking, and it actually feels okay now. But although I accept her lack of romantic interest, I can’t say I am completely over her yet, and it’s hard for me not to consider the future with her despite her lack of interest and the distance. And every time there is a lull in communication she finds something to keep it going. My issue is I fear that by continuing to be friends, I am making this harder on myself and possibly being unfair to her. 

I am confused by how I can apply some of the teachings of stoicism to my situation. On one hand I feel I should accept what fate has brought me, which is a good person who apparently really wants to be my friend, and stop focusing on the past and future. But I am trying to be wise and just to myself and her. I don’t want to be in a situation where I am constantly in pain or where I cannot be a true friend to her. I am trying to accept that I can control so little of this, but I still think that how I act now has some bearing on this relationship and my life overall. I would appreciate any advice into what I have done wrong at any point so far or any misconceptions of the philosophy I may carry.

"Once a cheater, always a cheater (?)","I've been in a wonderful and healthy relationship with my girlfriend for over a year now. My parents know her well, but her family sees me only as a close friend because according to her, her parents are strict and forbid her from having a relationship with me until we’re at the right age.

However, a few months into our relationship, she admitted to me that she had developed feelings for me while she was still with her ex-partner. Her explanation was that their relationship had turned toxic, which led her to seek solace in her feelings for me. 

Yes, she acknowledged her mistake and apologized, I couldn't help but feel hurt and conflicted about the situation. It just seemed unjustifiable to me, regardless of the circumstances.

At first, I tried to brush it aside because our relationship was going so well and I was genuinely happy with her. But as time passed, it really started to bother me.

I know people can change, and she seems sincere in her efforts to be a better person, but I can't help but be bothered by the fact that she liked me while she was still in a relationship with someone else. Even though there are no signs of her being unfaithful now, I am scared that history might repeat itself.

She reassures me constantly and seems genuinely happy with our relationship. She makes me the happiest person, and my attachment to her deepens each day. However, that knowledge of her past actions still haunts me, and I can't shake off the fear of ""once a cheater, always a cheater.""

I'm torn and confused about what to do. On one hand, I want to trust her and believe that people can change, but on the other hand, the fear of being hurt remains. It's hard to shake off this new label that's been put on her, even though she's working hard to prove that she's different now.

A critique of the dichotomy of control.,"Without a belief in a providential universe, the dichotomy of control rapidly devolves into Hedonism and Nihilism. I'll explain. Typically this practice is used by secular modern people to argue that Stoicism can be practiced without their metaphysical beliefs, but the truth is that the results of practicing the complete system vs only the easy therapeutic sayings are worlds apart.

If you don't believe in any providence or cosmic reason, intelligence, logos, deity, or ordering principle (gasp) then all you're doing to justify the dichotomy of control is to say ""because it feels good"". It's less stressful. Ignoring problems is just comforting. I am not denying it is, because it absolutely is relaxing to not worry. In fact, why not just not care about anything? Nothing makes any sense, the world is random, has no purpose, so just chill out and literally take no concern or higher responsibilities. I'm sounding Epicurean now since they explicitly advised against anything that would burden you in the slightest in order to keep your cool.

Therefore, if you don't believe in anything greater than yourself, there is nothing stopping you from continue the process of not caring into all matters, internal or external. This isn't even extreme, it's how people already live. Nobody is out there in any significant numbers worrying about their honor, integrity, fidelity, sincerity, bravery, humility, and so on and on.

But let's rephrase this recipe into providential terms: Learn to separate what is up to you to govern from what belongs to God to govern and you will do well. You don't get to tell God how to run things, how to create the world, how humans should be, how your husband should be, how your wife should be, how nature should be ordered. Nor how God makes you, for that matter. But Providence did give you a portion of the divine mind in your soul, as a means to be sentient enough to control your judgements and assent. That is wholely yours, and not even God can interfere there, though a suggestion and guidance can be made.

All of this is in line with the religious tone of the writings of Epictetus, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius. The reason they don't go astray, is not because they write it down on a journal every day, but because they have their full trust in the God as described by Zeno of Citium hundreds of years earlier.",Stoicism,1609540573.0,t3_kokrdt,0.53,1

Ryan Halliday - The Grifting Fraudster,"

I was excited to hear that Adam Carolla had a guest on his show that was championing Stoicism. It didn't take long for me to raise an eyebrow regarding to this author sincerity.
Ryan Halliday began the interview by replying to Adams question "" What is Stoicism?""

He replied ""Stoicism is a philosophical school that started in Rome........""
This is wrong as most people with a cursory interest in Stoicism would know. He went on to give an underwhelming summary of what this Hellenic philosophy is. I became curious of who this person is so I looked into his past .  He was a protege Of Robert Greene , the author of '48 rules of power' . Count yourself blessed if you don't of this book. It's closer to Machiavelli than anything produced by the Stoics. All about how to obtain externals through whatever means. 

The phenomena is called 'controlled opposition'. Stoicism was the ruling school of thought during Rome's peak . Stoicism spreading presents many problems for those running this world. If this philosophy is adopted correctly...fear of death , imprisonment or social disapproval loose their power . ...

Lastly the book he released before he was ""enlightened to Stoicism"" was about the media called ' Trust me I'm lying'

How Stoics approach abortion,"Hello, fellow prokopton.

With yesterday's decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the precedent set by Roe v. Wade, which essentially allows states to ban abortion, I thought it best to allow a day of absorption before posting this. For the American women in this community especially, this can be an incredibly difficult time. So first, I would like to say that r/Stoicism (as it always has) will be a community available to provide advice on your various situations you may face in the coming weeks and months.

Now, that said, I would like to use yesterday's decision as a means to observe two different approaches to ethics, and how they can clash irreconcilably. First, I will briefly define deontological ethics and Stoic ethics.

>**Deontological Ethics:** A form of ethics that sets forth a series of moral norms and absolutes, such that an individual must adhere to them without regard for consequences. These moral absolutes are considered ""right,"" and being ""right"" is considered morally superior to being ""good."" These moral absolutes also override an individual's own personal reason, making circumstantial decisionmaking impossible. In other words, if something is ""wrong"" according to deontological ethics, then a person must *never* do it. This type of ethics is very common in religions, and often approaches humans as inherently flawed creatures that need an external correcting action.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

>**Stoic Ethics:** A form of ethics that does not set any moral absolutes regarding specific actions, but rather posits that an individual's intentionality must be based on reason and virtue--without regard for consequences. For Stoics, the ""good"" of virtue is manifest primarily in *why* an individual makes a decision, and secondarily in *how* an individual decides to respond after making a decision. It places total trust in an individual's personal reason from moment to moment--meaning that an action deemed inappropriate in one circumstance can easily be deemed appropriate in another. This type of ethics hinges on the idea that humans are inherently rational creatures that can make virtuous decisions without an external correcting action.

Okay, with that out of the way, let's dive into the matter at hand, to inform why Stoics and deontologists will typically hold conflicting views surrounding abortion.

In deontological ethics, the matter of abortion is often framed as a moral absolute, either:

* Abortion kills a defenseless human person; killing a defenseless human person is *always* bad;
* Abortion provides a woman autonomy over her own body; rejecting bodily autonomy is *always* bad.

Note, while the second view is held by some, it is irrelevant for discussion and reflection today. The first view is more predominantly held and directly affected the decision made yesterday.

In Stoic ethics, the matter of abortion is considered morally indifferent, which means that either:

* An individual will determine that, under present circumstances, abortion is an appropriate action;
* An individual will determine that, under present circumstances, abortion is an inappropriate action.

Stoics regard those who choose not to employ their own reason, but rather blindly accept the stated moral absolutes of some external authority, as fools. And a Stoic who holds some moral absolutes as a result of their prior exposure to deontological ethics must contend with those and decide whether those moral absolutes matter more than personal intentionality and virtue. This is where the irreconcilable clash comes into play. A person must make a choice: be a Stoic or be a fool. Use reason or adhere to external moral absolutes.

It is worth noting that while the U.S. Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade was described as being because abortion is not a right guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution or its amendments, this is almost certainly a red herring used as thin veneer for their ethical foundations and the ethical foundations of those who installed them. I will not get dragged into the miasma of a pedantic debate over ""rights."" That will veer us away from the matter at hand: how humans approach ethics.

I will close how I began. r/Stoicism will keep its doors open to those who need our advice. Whether they are Stoics themselves who have temporarily been overcome by an emotionally-charged situation, or whether they are non-Stoics who simply like to hear the advice of coolheaded individuals, it matters not. With this issue, as with all others, this community is here to help, just as our ancient Greek predecessors were on the Stoa Poikile of Athens all those centuries ago.",Stoicism,1656157903.0,t3_vkdenr,0.54,3

**“You must no longer feel anger, resentment, envy, or regret,” said Epictetus.** Many stoics, such as Epictetus, seem to completely disown emotions, seeing them as irrational and therefore bad. But human emotions, having developed over millions of years for evolutionary purposes (such as the desire to eat when the body requires energy) are natural, and, as Aurelius points out, *“nothing that is according to nature can be evil.”* The problem with emotions then is not that they exist, it is that they are often not as they should be, they are not *“in accord with reason.”* Living virtuously then is not living emotionlessly but living with the correct emotions. As Aristotle said, “*some describe moral virtue as being a kind of freedom from emotion and disturbance; this is incorrect because the assertion should be qualified: they should have said moral virtue is freedom from those emotions that are not as they should be.”*

If we can discipline ourselves, train ourselves, to have emotions that are aligned with how they rationally should be, then *“emotions are not only blameless, but even praiseworthy!” (St. Augustine).* This will not be an easy task though, for *“anyone can become angry — that is easy. But to be angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, and in the right way — this is not easy.” (Aristotle).*

"Should I date this girl??? (Long, sorry)","So I am talking to this girl I met from Tinder. We went on a first date and it was definitely the best first date I've been on. We'd been texting for a couple weeks before, and had to reschedule a couple times so I already had a sense of who she was and she is just really really cool. She's pretty, and I can talk to her about things I can never talk to other girls about, because she is a huge geek and very intelligent and articulate, and she is really sweet and kind of innocent-seeming, and basically I was just very comfortable around her and she basically said the date went really well and she wants to see me again, and she has started texting more since then and interacting with her just makes me happy.

HOWEVER. I'm terrible at relationships. I haven't been in many real longterm relationships. And I am not a very secure person by any means, and relationships really make me very neurotic. I get insecure, and I always think about the other person, and obsess, and while in some ways I feel much more confident, in other ways they really just kill me psychologically. I am already feeling this with this girl. I worry whenever she doesn't text back, and before we went out she kind of went AWOL for a week dealing with a friend who developed feelings for her (and she was on spring break) and it just kind of killed me and I actually started feeling better when I thought she was ghosting me and I was done. But now we have gone out and she has given clear signs that she really seems to like me, which again makes me very happy because she just seems like a really special girl, and I haven't been in a relationship in a while and it's exciting, and we're just really on the same wavelength. 

So I really don't know what to do. It's a no-brainer that I should try to date this girl. But I have attachment issues and I'm so scared of losing the few people I really connect with, especially if it's romantically. I'm scared of messing up. She is nowhere near the type of girl who would ever cheat or hurt me like that or anything, but I still worry about this in all my relationships because I've really been hurt before. I even worry about the fact that at somepoint even if things go really well, it'll end eventually and either I will get hurt, which would really suck and be regrettable, or I will hurt her, which is unacceptable.

I know that was a lot, but I wanted to articulate my feelings so maybe you guys could help give me some guidance from a Stoic point of view. I cannot tell if the ""stoic thing to do"" is to realize that this will inevitably lead to pain in some form, whether she ends up not liking me and ghosts me in a month, or we start dating and breakup in 2 years, and likely the amount of pain in the end will be proportional to the time put in............or does the modern Stoic look at this and say ""proceed virtuously, if you really like this girl, give her your all and enjoy the struggle to come to terms with the impermanence and possibility of getting hurt or losing her eventually""...?????

How can i cure or diminish…this lustful desire. It’s been beating my ass,"It’s Sex basically, you all see posts like this every day i know. My story may be a bit different though. Before i begin i need to clarify that i’m neither a feminist nor a incel..or do i have any hatred towards anyone. I do not feel like i am entitled to a woman’s body. I do not feel entitled to anything in this world including my care i’ve gotten from my parents or even the opportunity to go to a good high school and live in good neighborhood etc etc…

20 y/o male. I live in the Southern part of the US. I work as a new car lot porter at my job at a dealership. Huge car guy, my after work…or free time I’m making artwork. Whether it’s sketching a portrait or building a full 3D car. My day consists of work -> home -> repeat. 
The thing is i’ve just recently been able to drive myself to and from work and now i have a car so i can take myself places. I used to think my lack of having a car was stopping me from getting 🐱. Turns out everyone else was right and it is an internal issue. Who knew. 
 My life seems so purposeless now though. I make artwork but no one gives a fuck. No one cares about a starving artist. People say like post on Social media and i’ve been down that road it makes me hate doing the craft itself. I feel like i have no friends at all. Well i don’t.
 I’m going through the list of things thats really on my mind right now. The main thing is of course Sex. 
 Its been exactly a year since i was in my first/last relationship. Ironically she actually had hmu a few days ago. I was excited of course but she got very flakey and i just stopped giving my attention and energy away. To be honest seeing her message took me through a lot of emotions. It’s one of the reasons i’m trying so hard to find a “rebound” We didn’t talk much when we reconnected. Just some texts about how i finally got my vehicle and my new job. When we were dating i worked retail and couldn’t afford a car. I offered to take her out since i now could do more for her. But she said “no thanks” so she’s probably with someone else or idk. Half of me wishes she never had checked up on me. First heartbreaks are always the worst. I took the high road and said i appreciate her reaching out and checking up on me.
I know this is all over the place but bear with me. There’s definitely some women at my job i look at and seen look back at me. Never say anything though. I don’t know how i should do this. There’s like these weird energies or vibes i feel when i pass certain women. Some good some bad. Some really good. I seem to come up with the smoothest game plan and lines in my head. But when i get the opportunity i freeze up.
Ok I need to also mention i’m on nofap…1 1/2 weeks. I do 50 pushups daily. My GM mentioned that he noticed i was working out. So i don’t know if it’s noticeable to the women or not. I always ask myself what are they thinking about me. 
Before you say dating at a job is bad….i am required to talk to 0 people daily…i’m outside all day (others are in) It’s to the point i’m always questioned if i work there since i don’t where a sales or service uniform. Every other employee does but me. Actually there are other examples but you get my point. 
I know rejection can happen…it’s just the uncertainty how. Also the choosing signals i get i always try to assume its them being nice. Maybe it is.

Need advice on annoying beggars,"Hi all, 

During my daily commute to work, there are always the same gypsy beggars that enter my train to hand out flyers that tell me to give them money. During the first 5 encounters I had no difficulty rejecting them. Now it really starts to annoy me to the point that I want to grab them by their throats and tell them that they have to buy a train ticket, stop bothering people and contribute to society by working a normal job. They know my annoyed face by now and they still have the audacity to try and hand me over their stupid flyer. The fact that I see people next to me give them money makes it even more frustrating because I know they live in a RV camp outside of the city with no poor living standards at all. These healthy men should work but in my wealthy european country it's too easy to receive undeserved ""disability to work"" credit payed for by the income tax of the working class. And that is what possibly annoys me the most. Although this is an assumption, most gypsies actually receive this credit in my country.

How would the stoics deal with this? To be not disturbed by externals? But that does not stop them from bothering people right? Was Diogenes not a beggar himself?

Women trying to make me go against the Stoic path...,"I am naturally very stoic and live extremely minimal. I do not see a virtue in being minimal, i just do not desire material wealth.

In modern society, people always seem to comment on this and try to act as though it is some kind of a problem - especially women who try to come into my life. I eat minimally, but enough. I usually drink only water. I hardly contact anyone. I am very content with this - i need no luxury. I write and create art. I have very little furniture - mainly books. But women seem to try cause problems over this - call me antisocial, say i need to show more emotion, say i need to decorate, say i need to relax (even tho i am), after we make love they want me to be emotional...

Women will literally get mad with me because i am not reactive to things in the same way they wish to be - they get mad when i say i don't want certain possessions, or when i do not see the point in certain status symbols, etc.  I can be content with pretty much anything meanwhile they will complain at me...

I will interject here and say that obviously if i have a long standing relationship with a women i have been with for years then of course i will be perhaps more lenient for the sake of her happiness because of my love for her. But outside of a situation like that, i will remain laconic and firm.

I find myself declining dates with women because they always expect me to break my virtues for the sake of their expediency; especially in regards to buying objects and other material aspects of life. Or when they ask for my advice and i give them Stoic advice - which they hate.

Anybody else found this to be the case? Is it best to just not date for a while? How do others go about navigating these aspects of modernity whilst remaining Stoic, when it seems people actively try to go against the path?",Stoicism,1692704359.0,t3_15y39dl,0.37,0

6 problems with stoicism,Thoughts?,Stoicism,1702493403.0,t3_18ho0pi,0.48,0
Wanting to transition from Christianity to Stoicism,"Hey y’all, I’m hoping this is keeping in line with rule 2 (newbie here) I want to preface this by saying I’m not a theologian or an expert on stoicism, I’m just a 22 year old guy looking for direction and resources while I try to make an informed decision. Because I’m neither a theologian or a philosopher I will make some incorrect statements and misunderstandings so I’d love to be educated on any errors I make. 

I’ve never shared this with anyone in my personal life, so I apologize if this is too long or I ramble on too long. TL;DR at the bottom.

My background in Christianity comes from growing up in the Bible Belt and being raised in the church since I was baptized as a baby. While I love the core teachings of Jesus and the way of life we’re supposed to follow,  I don’t feel like I’ve truly accepted Christ as my savior. I’ve struggled with doubt from an early age. I would say they are pretty common doubts like miracles, creationism, literal vs. figurative interpretation, etc. I wasn’t really allowed to explore these questions with the people in my life and was dealt with some pretty frustrating answers, like the classic, “because the Bible says so”. It felt like exploring these issues was wrong and I just needed to shut up and believe. 

I’ve also noticed some of the negative aspects of Christian culture that I’m working on deconstructing now like, intolerance of others, nationalism, and political agendas tied into faith.

There’s so many negatives to christian culture that I find it hard to even want to associate myself with it. Like purity culture, the new satanic panic conspiracies, mega-churches, and all the big figures associated with them.

My dissatisfaction with the church and the cultural issues are what led me to exploring Stoicism. As of now, I’ve only read “Meditations” and “Letters from a Stoic”, so I’ll admit I have a long path of learning ahead of me. Despite this, they have left a deep impact on me and I’ve found myself wanting to pursue the idea of living a stoic life and studying the philosophy. 

I like that there are similarities between Stoicism and Christianity that make it feel like I’m creating a positive alternative in my life, instead of creating a vacuum. Stuff like living a life of virtue, self-discipline, and not worrying about things outside of your control really appeal to me.

As someone who deals with mental health issues, I can also say that I’ve found more resilience in myself by reading those two books than the nervous reassurance “God will heal you from this” that I’ve received in the past. 

I’m not expecting Stoicism to fix all my problems or magically change my life in an instant. I also know it’s not without its faults, but I think that this is the next best step for what direction my life should take and I want to begin the work. 

So with all of that, I’d really appreciate advice on what or who I should read to learn more about stoicism and ways to implement it in my daily life, as I continue to explore this transition. 

TL;DR- I’m a christian debating leaving the faith because of doubt and the problematic culture and looking for resources to research stoicism before I make a switch.

Edit: Thank y’all again for the replies and advice given, I don’t usually put myself out there a lot so I really appreciate everyone’s thoughts. I’m coming to the conclusion that this isn’t an either/or situation and that I can take the good from both and apply it to live a better life and not worry about labels or what others think.

How to stop gatekeeping soon??,"Hello, 

As title says I want to learn to stop gatekeeping. 

For context, Spider-Man NWH comes out in 4 days and I'm feeling a strong resistance and very gatekeepy right now. 

I've been a Spider-Man fan my entire life, I've been reading the comics since I was a young lad and I'm covered in Spider-Man tattoos as a 21 year old man. 

Now as someone who is really into Spider-Man, it makes me annoyed when I see others showing excitement for Spider-Man NWH even though they aren't long term fans and more recently got into the character and lore. Especially people from highschool who use to bully me posting about the movie on Snapchat.

I always feel frustrated or a urge to ""protect"" or ""fact check"" people whenever they try to talk about the new movie with me or just post about it on social media. 

Now I'm 100% aware the reason I gatekeep is because I've made it such a part of my identity, and I'm scared that if other people are into the stuff I'm into, then nothing makes me unique and special, I'll just be an average Joe. 

I just want to be able to relax and enjoy Spider-Man NWH in 4 days without feeling like I have to PROVE IM THE BIGGEST FAN!!!! I want to share this excitement with others and rejoice at the fact that new fans are coming in because of this. But my ego won't let me. I'm aware it's a problem but don't know what to do or how to stop.

I know all this sounds incredibly silly coming from a 21 year old and I'll probably look back on this post and laugh, but right now this gatekeeping is bothering the fuck outta me and I wanna just let go and enjoy myself.

""You are encouraged to take one moment for contemplation, conscious breathing or meditation when WeCroak notifications arrive. We find that a regular practice of contemplating mortality helps spur needed change, accept what we must, let go of things that don’t matter and honor things that do.""

There are a lot of solid quotes from Stoic philosophers on this app and I thought it aligned with the philosophy of ""momento mori""

I'm a coward,"So , recently I was at a train station , trying to book a ticket at a booking booth and I was the first guy to put the ticket in line....later another guy came and argued that he was the first to put the ticket and even though I tried to reason with him he just escalated to the point where he verbally abused me and at that point I have gone to the railway police but he( the police man) said he is not in charge and told me to go to another police station which was in another location ( even though he was in that train station he refused to help me and I don't know why?)so I had no idea what I should do and returned to the booth and he again escalated the situation and I gave up on the situation.As he was trying to book the ticket first (the booking will start in a few minutes), the booking officer said that he cannot book the ticket since the train has already departed, so this guy had a verbal fight with the officer too and left the booth and I ended up getting my ticket first.But deep down I know that if the guy's train was available he would have got the ticket first and I couldn't stop him even though he was wrong.

I haven't been able to stop beating myself up after that situation and had many resentful fantasies as to hurt him or kill him... stuff like that or either kill myself ( but again my mind says if you are going to kill yourself then kill him first and then kill yourself). I know this sounds crazy and I promise I'm not that guy who kills someone, i couldn't even stand up for myself in the first place so I'm not that guy, the incident was 6 months ago and I can't get over it, I think I need some advice, i haven't told this to anyone since I am afraid that they will call me coward and judge me for my incompetence.",Stoicism,1704032720.0,t3_18v8sr3,0.56,3

AI art and Stoicism,"AI right now is menacing the entire artistic world, I am beyond disgusted about what tecnology is becoming in the last decade.

Short term dopamine release leads to inevitable alienation.

A big part of art is about embrace your culture and individual identity, it's sad to see that a lot of people never had the chance to understand it.

I see a lot of people suffer, im'not talking about the economic question, i'm referring about the artistic matter. I'm not that scared of the challenge that AI is posing to me, but younger people, beginner artist that I know are more corcerned about the general situation.

meat eaters are dumb(er),"τὴν μέντοι κρεώδη τροφὴν θηριωδεστέραν ἀπέφηνε καὶ τοῖς ἀγρίοις ζῴοις προσφορωτέραν. εἶναι δὲ ταύτην ἔλεγε καὶ βαρυτέραν καὶ τῷ νοεῖν τι καὶ φρονεῖν ἐμπόδιον· τὴν γὰρ ἀναθυμίασιν τὴν ἀπ´ αὐτῆς θολωδεστέραν οὖσαν ἐπισκοτεῖν τῇ ψυχῇ· παρὸ καὶ βραδυτέρους φαίνεσθαι τὴν διάνοιαν τοὺς πλείονι ταύτῃ χρωμένους. 

My trans:

Musonius demonstrated that meat is an uncivilised food stuff and more appropriate for wild animals. He argued that it is a heavy food that serves as an obstacle for the understanding and inteligence, because the exhalations that emanate from meat, being turbid, end up darkening the soul. It is for this reason that people who eat a lot of meat seem to be rather slow in intelligence. 

He goes on to say: 

δεῖν δὲ τὸν ἄνθρωπον, ὥσπερ συγγενέστατον τοῖς θεοῖς τῶν ἐπιγείων ἐστίν, οὕτω καὶ
ὁµοιότατα τρέφεσθαι τοῖς θεοῖς. ἐκείνοις µὲν οὖν ἀρκεῖν τοὺς ἀπὸ γῆς καὶ ὕδατος ἀναφεροµένους
ἀτµούς, ἡµᾶς δ' ὁµοιοτάτην ταύτῃ προσφέρεσθαι τροφὴν ἂν εἶπεν τὴν κουφοτάτην καὶ καθαρω τάτην·
οὕτω δ' ἂν καὶ τὴν ψυχὴν ἡµῶν ὑπάρχειν καθαράν τε καὶ ξηράν, ὁποία οὖσα ἀρίστη καὶ σοφωτάτη εἴη ἄν.

Man is the closest among the living beings in familial closeness to the gods, he must also nourish himself in like manner to the gods. The vapors that arise from the earth and from the water are enough for the gods, and so man too should eat food that might be similar in character to these elements, that is to say, the most pure and dry kind of food. Having a soul that is pure and dry in this way, he might become noble and wise. 

The last sentence is diff to translate into good English while following the Greek closely.

For similar sentiments (and about frugal eating) see this post: http://laudatortemporisacti.blogspot.ca/2014/07/fat-paunches-have-lean-pates.html

 I don't actually believe meat eaters are as a general rule dumber, but it is funny to read it in this great Stoic thinker. It's a good mix of Stoic physics and how it is integral to Stoic ethics.

Ryan Holiday isn't controversial figure of modern stoicism just because of envy of his success.,"Maybe a bit controversial title. But i think people here should know who is Ryan Holiday. 

There is huge part of people that don't really like Ryan. Some complain about his marketing practices, some don't see any benefits in his work, some don't like the ""self-help vibe"" and some arguments are about his overpriced coins or courses. Every argument is valid, but some of them sounds like envy. 

I personally ""consume"" Ryan on daily basis for few months. I watch reels on Instagram, longer videos every Saturday on YouTube and reading daily stoic book every morning. Few years ago i also read Obstacle is the Way and reread it few weeks ago. So, I would say, I know his work around stoicism quite well. 

Some of Ryan's background: he worked in marketing on really high position and wrote critical book about marketing after leaving that field. His mentor is Robert Greene (48 Laws of power, and in few subreddits really popular book Art of seduction). He is married, father of 2 kids, and what he said in his videos he basically maintain relationship with his wife from really young age (around 19 he started dating her, if i remember well). Few years ago he opened really interesting bookstore (i will write more about it later). That's his background in nutshell. 

I also ""consume"" Robert Greene reels and sometimes i watch interview with him or his own 5-10 minutes talking videos on his YouTube channel. I've never finished any of his book, but i listed through 48 Laws and understood what he wants to tell his readers. 

I understand why Ryan getting here so much hate. His background from marketing could evoke some negativity, and if you check his courses it seems more like ""cult membership"" than philosophy learning. Also selling coins with ""memento mori"" or ""amor fati"", and some framed quotes seems more like orient style market than serious eshop. Also some people could be disgusted by his cooperation with Robert Greene because ""his books are for sociopaths and pick up artists!"". 

But try to look at him from different angle. He most probably practice what he preaches. Tattoos, he is consistent in what he saying and writing about and he is not changing people that he is friend with in public eye. He is friend with Robert Greene, and he took the right from him like style of writing, historical stories that underline rightness of his point. He is able to maintain monogamous relationship although he is famous and still relatively young. He lives in countryside, so he most probably like animals and nature. He might have lot of money, but he never showed his car, hotel in which he stayed, expensive watch nor vacation destination. He keeps his private life relatively closed from his public life. He never advertised something that is not related to stoicism, only books of other authors, not blender, parfume or restaurant. He opened bookstore with just few hundred books. Books that he consider useful for life. Novel, poetry, original works from stoics, Epicurus, Plutarch, biographies of principled or inspirational historical figures like Zemurray, Frankl, Churchill or Rockefeller. Books that he personally read (some of them even multiple times) and consider them good to sell them in his own bookstore. Have you heard any controversy about him, drugs, fights, drunk driving, affair or sexual abusing? Me neither. (If you want to argue this, just google name ""Christopher J. Hadnagy"", not really famous writer outside tech community, but he was famous enough to be controversial). 

What i wanted to say with that whole novel? To be honest, nothing new or life changing. I understand why people here don't like Ryan, but they most probably don't understand him. He is not typical self-help influencer like Mark Manson or generic ""productivity, happiness, and make more money"" gurus that are everywhere and they are basically the same, just different faces. He doing great job in terms of making stoicism extremely accessible. Wouldn't that accessibility was goal of every ancient stoic? One was principled emperor (Marcus Aurelius). Epictetus was lecturing slave. Seneca was cool businessman that don't really cared about his fortune, he just enjoyed what he got. But all of them tried to help others prokoptons or just ordinary people around them to live better life. Ryan seems like them. Although his selling practices, we should value him. Just because he did stoicism so accessible. And also, he seems like principled man that don't value consumerism, flexing or advertising anything just because ""it pays well"". He exclusively advertising his own shit to make living, and i admire that.

You might dont see Ryan as someone beneficial to our community, because you don't need his content to study stoicism. That's great you are so advanced that you understand ancient books without guidance. But you are most probably small minority. Stoicism was always about community study, or mentors lectures. We have this huge community, because it's part of stoicism to discuss and learn from more wise prokoptons. He do positive advertising for us (he also mentioned our community in book Obstacle is the Way). More concerning should be red*illers, Andr*w Tat* fans or nof*p community. That's not that great advertisement.

Why I’m NOT skipping/fast forwarding through ads,"I feel like this may apply to Stoicism, but I can’t quite put it into words. 
Anyway, recently, I’ve been deciding to NOT skip over ads and commercials. I’m not necessarily paying attention to the ads or patronizing the sponsors, but I am resisting the urge to skip them. The reason is that I think skipping through ads makes me more impatient and makes me develop an attitude of instant gratification. I need to remember that nothing in this world is free. The creation of content, even the silliest video on the internet, takes time and effort, and when a video is accompanied by sponsorship or ads, that is the payment for that content. Not skipping over the ad makes me invested, and makes me more likely to appreciate the content when it arrives. Of course there are videos where the content itself is so insubstantial that it becomes merely a delivery method for the sponsorships. In those cases I avoid those content creators in the future. The point is that I think deliberately not skipping over ads nurtures patience and gratitude. 
Any thoughts? Am I full of it?

In the local park there is a vibrant wildlife. There are many trees with squirrels, monkeys climbing and birds flying all around. But then there are two very distinguishable macaws. Even tho these macaws peacefully share the environment with the other animals, they are always a couple. No matter what they are doing, what the others are doing, they remain in each other's company, and it has been this way for years. It is real, I only changed the animals. 

This lifestyle seen in nature, therefore natural, is in me. I am extremely introverted, I don't need to be in a group like many others, I don't need friends with me all the time BUT I need a woman, I really do. I am not saying I think I need, I guarantee this based on previous experiences

This is where my stoic self fails. I am not supposed to look to others more than to myself, and still I get really upset that it is so easy for my colleagues in university to be around with girls, and get touching from them while it is extremely difficult to me.

Also, it is completely natural, I have seen evidence with my own eyes that it is, why do I still feel that this is wrong?

I mean, didn’t Epictetus say that we should practice stoicism only for ourselves and in stillness without the dogmatism of preaching it to other people? That we should learn of the practice of Socrates and be a „hidden philosopher“? 

Don’t get me wrong - I think it’s great that so many people are learning about it and find deep fulfillment in these teachings, as do I.

Losing my faith in Stoicism,"I have always thought of stoicism to be a very good foundation to build a good life; a rational virtue system built on the foundation that all people matter and that people ultimately want to help each other. It felt like a pro-social, life affirming philosophy that placed altruism and discipline at the center, and provided a justification both for complex civilizations and for harnessing the power of those civilizations to enrich the lives of all members within it.

The problem is, I no longer believe that acting altruistically is part of all or even most people's nature. I feel like altruism is actually a cultural construct, one which is falling apart right before our very eyes. How else can we explain all of the anti-social behavior we see around us? The standard stoic response of ""these people are not acting within their nature"" feels hollow to me.

Let me give a quick laundry list of some of the anti-social behavior currently being perpetrated on a global scale.

1. Putin's senseless invasion of Ukraine and slaughter of citizens there.

2. The continued destruction of our planet by the fossil fuel industry.

3. People saying with a straight face that they would prefer immuno-compromised individuals to die than to wear a cloth mask.

4. The United States shrugging its shoulders in response to nineteen children and two adults being slaughtered.

Like I said, looking at these events and saying ""these people are not acting within their nature"" feels absurd. It feels much more reasonable to say that being pro-social is not, in fact, within people's nature. I would go so far as to say that acting within one's self interest is not within people's nature; none of the acts I mentioned are ultimately beneficial to the individuals perpetrating them -- they fill their lives with conflict, and may lead them to short and horrifying ends.

It seems much more reasonable to me to say that people's natures are ultimately irrational and arbitrary; that there is no fundamental human nature one can appeal to or cultivate. If a person has somehow programmed themselves to believe that their ethical worth is based on how much wealth or power they accrue, then there is no fundamental nature that they can return to; they become like the proverbial paper clip generating super intelligence; a machine which, because it has no better goal to aspire to, generates paper clips until it destroys itself and its environment.

Stoicism then begins to feel like senseless, iron-man style, asceticism -- the kind of performative asceticism which proves willpower but doesn't achieve anything beyond that.

Which pleasures did you choose to abstain from after adopting stoicism?,"Seneca strongly urges us to avoid anything that's considered liberal arts, he tells us to avoid all the distractions(Pleasures) and solely focus on our work.

So for the past few months I have deeply examined my routine, I discarded any form of social media (expect Reddit but.. even Seneca failed to stay a vegetarian for all his life) and I'm slowly starting to believe that reading novels is a form of pleasure, I don't really believe that diagnoses would have read any novels.. 

On the other hand, Seneca wrote plays and literature therefore I am quite confused, so were the plays that Seneca wrote his calling in life, or were they a pleasure he chose to indulge in?

Is Jason Mraz a stoic?,"I am not the first person to bring up this exact same scenario (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/8ielsw/stoic_messages_in_jason_mraz_im_yours/)), but I wanted to revisit the topic and do my own breakdown of Jason Mraz's song ""I'm Yours"" ([youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkHTsc9PU2A)).

&#x200B;

The backstory is that I've been reading my first official stoic book, ""Meditations"" (unless you count listening to Ryan Holiday's audio book ""The Obstacle is the Way"" and on the radio the other day is the aforementioned song by Mr. A to Z. I was suddenly thunderstruck by how much the song seemed to parallel a lot of Mr. Aurelius' observations on stoicism. Am I just projecting because my brain is saturated with his thoughts? Or is Jason Mraz secretly writing stoic lyrics? Let's discuss!

Here are the original lyrics without my notes:

*Well you done done me and you bet I felt it*  
*I tried to be chill but you're so hot I melted*  
*I fell right through the cracks*  
*And now I'm trying to get back*  
*Before the cool done run out*  
*I'll be giving it my best-est*  
*And nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention*  
*I reckon it's again my turn,*  
*To win some or learn some*  
*But I won't hesitate no more, no more*  
*It cannot wait, I'm yours*  
*Well open up your mind and see like me*  
*Open up your plans and damn you're free*  
*Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love*  
*Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing*  
*We are just one big family*  
*And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved*  
*So I won't hesitate no more, no more*  
*It cannot wait I'm sure*  
*There's no need to complicate*  
*Our time is short*  
*This is our fate, I'm yours*  
*D-d-do do you, but do you, d-d-do*  
*But do you want to come on*  
*Scooch on over closer dear*  
*And I will nibble your ear*  
*Oh oh*  
*I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror*  
*And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer*  
*But my breath fogged up the glass*  
*And so I drew a new face and I laughed*  
*I guess what I been saying is there ain't no better reason*  
*To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons*  
*It's what we aim to do*  
*Our name is our virtue*  
*But I won't hesitate no more, no more*  
*It cannot wait I'm yours*  
*Well open up your mind and see like me*  
*Open up your plans and damn you're free*

And here they are again with my notes. I would love some of the more well read prokopton's on here to comment.

*Well you done done me and you bet I felt it*  
*I tried to be chill but you're so hot I melted*  
*I fell right through the cracks*  
*And now I'm trying to get back*

**Now, I'm not going to try to pretend he's not singing about someone else... that seems obvious. But here he mentions trying to get back... to being chill? Metaphor for being the master of your emotions?**

*Before the cool done run out*  
*I'll be giving it my best-est*

**MA always says to do your best!**

*And nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention*

**MA also mentions that divinity is the only external influence that can affect your happiness. (Could use a correction here, if I am mistaken.)**

*I reckon it's again my turn,*  
*To win some or learn some*

**Doesn't MA say something about doing away with books and learning directly? Kinda like life experience huh?**

*But I won't hesitate no more, no more*  
*It cannot wait, I'm yours*

**Don't waste time!**

  
*Well open up your mind and see like me*

**I think this was the line that originally struck me. Stoics talk about changing your perception in order to control your emotions. MA talks about stripping away illusion and describing very scientifically what something is.**

  
*Open up your plans and damn you're free*

**Could this be a reference to fate? Accepting what happens to you?**

  
*Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love*

**One of my favorite stoic maxims: Every person is an opportunity for kindness.**

  
*Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing*

**Stay in the present. Can't change the past, and the future hasn't happened yet.**

  
*We are just one big family*

**MA talks about how were part of the elements, the universe, etc.**  


*And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved*  
*So I won't hesitate no more, no more*  
*It cannot wait I'm sure*  
*There's no need to complicate*  
*Our time is short*

**Look at all this talk about time!**  


*This is our fate, I'm yours*

**MA describes fate as more like what has happened to you, rather than what will happen to you. Jason might be talking about predetermination here, but I still see a connection.**

  
*D-d-do do you, but do you, d-d-do*  
*But do you want to come on*  
*Scooch on over closer dear*  
*And I will nibble your ear*  
*Oh oh*

**Ugh, back to that person he's so in love with. Gross.**

  
*I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror*  
*And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer*  
*But my breath fogged up the glass*  
*And so I drew a new face and I laughed*

**Another reference to mastering emotions and choosing how to feel about things?**

  
*I guess what I been saying is there ain't no better reason*  
*To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons*  
*It's what we aim to do*  
*Our name is our virtue*

**Sounds like MA's incessant talk of ""nature"", being rational, and being your best.**

  
*But I won't hesitate no more, no more*  
*It cannot wait I'm yours*  
*Well open up your mind and see like me*  
*Open up your plans and damn you're free*  
*Look into your heart and you'll find the sky is yours*  
*So please don't please don't please don't*  
*There's no need to complicate*  
*'Cause our time is short*  
*This, oh this, this is our fate, I'm yours*

People hate me for speaking the truth,"I admit I have been tactless most of the time. I've only been very realistic. And it seems that people, even those I call “friends” whom I've know since primary school, hate straightforward people. I may come off as arrogant to them, but I feel like anti-intellectualism is at play. They hated it when they're presented with proof. Any wise person in that regard would humbly stand corrected, but they won't.

I'm writing this because obviously, I feel bad that they have to unfriend or block me, but I can't change myself to not notice those things. 

What I would like to ask is, as a Stoic, what should be a better course of action?

EDIT: Since a lot more people seems to misunderstand the situation, here it is. Suppose a “friend” is spewing nonsense on social media like “vaccines cause autism” or “COVID-19 is just a hoax” and then spreading those lies on more people, I believe as a responsible, educated individual should step up and prove them wrong. Sooner or later, an argument would be inevitable. I feel like I can't just sit here and do nothing while those people spread false information. That's my situation is.

I am going to be a Stoic from now on,"Hello Everyone,

I hope you are all well. Recently, I was in a spiritual stalemate, after being a strong Buddhist for a year. I did look into stoicism for a few weeks but then was stuck on what to follow: Stoicism, Buddhism or Hinduism.

It came to me that I was trying to find something that would give me a form of self. In Buddhism, I was practicing non-self as I perceiving myself to have no self. But, I soon realised I was being attached to Buddhism itself for the sake of my self (ironic isn’t it?).

So, realising the above, I formally said to myself I would compassionately go away from Buddhism in terms of practice/being a Buddhist.

Who knows, my Spiritual Path has been a winding road, but, I have fully accepted to be a stoic and it is massive relief, to know I can figure out I do have control (a degree of) in any situation. The dichotomy of control has helped me a lot. 

I’m sure this sub reddit will help a lot.

I have a few questions:

- I have bought a daily Stoic book. What is the one book, in Stoicism, that is beginner level and easy to understand?

- Is there a God in Stoicism? If so, do I have to believe in a god to be a stoic.

- Am I still allowed to read other religious/philosophical texts? I want to keep an open mind, which is why I intend to keep a single book from a single religion. 

Many thanks everyone :)",Stoicism,1576930982.0,t3_edpcfh,0.56,2
The obstacle is the way. Daily Stoic lessons have calmed me.,"""The world is constantly testing us. We set out to do something and it’s more trying than we expect. We face resistance. We get criticized. We run out of options. We experience technical difficulties. What will we do?

Marcus Aurelius would say that the Stoic finds a way to turn every negative into a positive. In this famous line, “The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.” what he’s suggesting is that—no matter how bad or seemingly undesirable a situation becomes—we always have the opportunity to practice virtue, to use the situation as an opportunity to be our best selves. We don’t control when things get hard, but we always control how we respond. We can show patience, courage, humility, resourcefulness, reason, justice, and creativity. The things that test us make us who we are.

The Stoic grows stronger and better with every obstacle they face. They rally to every challenge and thrive as a result. So can you.""

I signed up for the daily emails from Daily Stoic and I read every single one. The perspective is always clear and concise and I'd say the feeling I get consistently from the readings is that of humility. The emails calm me.

Origin of the name Epictetus,"> Epictetus was a Greek Stoic philosopher. He was born a slave at Hierapolis, Phrygia and lived in Rome until his banishment, when he went to Nicopolis in northwestern Greece for the rest of his life.     
   
His name comes from ""Epic"" and ""Tits"". His slave mother had epic breast's and since she was a slave, the owner of her named her child, Epictetus, after his mothers ""Epic tits"". Since the mother had 2 tits, owner formed the plural ""tits => tetus"" and named our young philosopher ""Epictetus"".

I feel frustrated that I am staying friends with my ex while they already have a new lover.,"I have.. an interesting relationship dynamic to say the least. And yes, I know you must be thinking why I'm not posting this on r/relationship_advice or what not. I will be doing that too. To me, this is a problem that i might need, or in this case, will need a lot of stoic advice to carry on and process myself. Thank you all in advance.

My story is as follows. Well, the short and long of it as I have yet to fully comprehend what has happened for how long. 

The gist of it is that after a seriously heated debate between me and my then-girlfriend. She decided that she doesnt want to be my girlfriend anymore. But we've still kept contact since, sometimes texting almost daily. I keep going on the pretense that maybe if I show her how much I care, how hard Im trying, then maybe she'll build enough trust for me to consider getting back. That lasted for a month, or two. And while all that was going on, in the midst of me constantly trying to mend that broken relationship, she was out having fun with another person, flirting with them, all the while still demanding/expecting things from me. Sometimes she would say that she wants to get back together but she is still so hurt by the past that she cant do so. Opting instead to become uncaring towards me and actively showing me that she is willing to defend another person. Something that she has never once done for me in the past.

At somepoint in that strained relationship a fight between us broke out because of how she thought i was so uncaring of her, even with her constant disregarding of my feelings. That ended in me cutting ties.. or so I though as I once again messaged her later, simply saying to want to say how much Ive loved her and how I'll be going away. This then resulted in us meeting up, while only after a day from our last, she has decided to become partners with the other person i was talking about before. We talked, and I somehow convinced myself that staying friends with her was the better choice. But witnessing her treat another person how I've always wanted to be treated just breaks my heart. I'm jealous of it, envious of how I can't have been the one. I don't know how to deal with these feelings. Or how to process myself moving forward. 

On one hand, I would like to stay to maybe gain a chance at rebuilding their trust and affection once more.

On the other, I know that by doing so, I risk myself not ever fully recovering from this relationship and tying myself down to it. 

Any stoic advice is extremely helpful as I do not know what I should be doing with myself moving forward. The thought of revenge does come to mind, but I do not think such shallowness is the right way to fulfillment and me being actually happy. Nor am I able to think of anyways of revenge lol. So please, as Stoics, please give me your advice on this topic... I am in dire need of help.

EDIT: I couldnt reply to every comment there is on this little post of mine. Im glad to have so many people give advice and pay mind to my problem. I thank you all for the kind words and will now continue studying the path of Stoicism so that one day I will be lucky enough to be able to apply the teachings of Stoicism to my life. And be able to give out such enlightening advices like the rest of us here. Peace and love be with you all.",Stoicism,1695148614.0,t3_16mypeq,0.64,15
"The war in Gaza is threatens to change my values, I seek advice in these difficult times."," Hi folks, This is my first post to this subreddit. Though I am a long-time subscriber. I hope to receive advice in these difficult times.   


I (38m) am married with 3 children. I am a physician in Israel, my speciality is psychiatry. I would consider myself an aspiring Stoic. for years I have read little by little Marcus's meditations and for the past 6 months I have dedicated 10 minutes every day to study or contemplate Stoic ideals, I try to live virtuously as best I can (most of the time). I do not actually pretend to be a true Stoic. Just someone on a journey to become one. stoicism helped me through the toughest times in residency. Epictetus helped me deal with abusive directors, and Marcus helped me keep it through countless 26-hour shifts treating human suffering in its rawest forms.  


I always considered myself a strong advocate of the concept of cosmopolitism.  Stoicism helped me keep my compassion when I was deployed for more than a year to do forensic work in the worst prison in the country. I worked with rapists and murderers and almost always I saw the human behind the mistakes (there were 2 exceptions) . I did not find evil in prison. just lost people wandering in ignorance.   


No one knows about my stoic ideals. Even my wife only has a vague notion that I have an unusual fondness to the late Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius blessed be his soul.   


But now I find myself at a difficulty, for the first time I find myself unable to reconcile my stoic ideals with what is happening around me. and what is happening to me.   


a week ago my nation was struck by a heinous terrorist attack from Hamas.   


The terrorists killed more than 1200 people. Almost all of them are civilians. They massacred a music vestige and took some of the girls captive after they disgraced them.   


Then they swept through the towns close to the border. Our people hid in their houses shutting the doors. So They swept house to house killing or capturing people. Some of the younger children were captured in animal cages and taken to the strip. When it was out on social media that the enemy was sweeping homes some people panicked and ran and were massacred unceremoniously.   


My friend hid in a safe room in his house for 50 minutes with an axe and with his wife and kid while the terrorists were inside.   
He requested support on social media but No one came (the terrorists did not find them and they survived)   


Now my nation is consumed in the drive for vengeance. And I am no exception. I wish the enemy pay in tears and blood for the atrocities they committed. I do not feel the compassion I once had toward the enemy. And I am ashamed to say I don't care. I do not know how to reconcile this.   


Thucydides once said that war is a cruel teacher. In the manner that values change.  The sanctity of human life is replaced by the drive for vengeance   


I feel that this is happening to me. I wish to continue my Stoic journey. But I cannot shake the deep hatred and thirst for vengeance. I seek guidance in these difficult times.",Stoicism,1697229941.0,t3_17789ua,0.74,466
Fear of climate change stems from attachment to old ways of living.,"People who deny and downplay climate change always talk in terms of fears.

The problem is that our nature tends to clash with the modern world in a lot of really silly dumb ways. I’m convinced no one should be working more than 32 hours a week.

I used to fall at the feet of women because of how beautiful they were. Also as a practicing Christian I am really trying to get better in this area. I would never cheat nor ever have a desire to do so, however sometimes looking a second too long I hate myself for. Just looking for some wisdom, advice etc on how I can become better :)

"I didn't have much, but I just lost everything.","My business partner referred me to stoicism. He said something about taking things as they come and understanding what is and is not in your control. Anyways it resonated. Let me back up though.

Long story short:

I am 23 and my now ex-girlfriend was 29. I left my laptop at her place one day after seeing her for 9 months. She found evidence of my cheating on her and proceeded to empty my bank accounts and throw all of my belongings in the street. I am already in huge credit card debt, and this kicked whatever depression I think I am suffering of at least a couple notches.

What is fucking me up is that I believe I loved her, the other were about sex. The greater issue is that I want to accept whatever happened and be grateful for everything that happened, even when now I have nothing.

Any thoughts or recommendations on how to not let rock bottom be so consuming to your brain? I don't want to have a black cloud hanging over my head everywhere I go.

"Is the hero from ""The Fountainhead"" a Stoic?","I just read ""The Fountainhead"" by Ayn Rand, because everyone seems to be saying how horrible her books are. I don't know if her other books are horrible, but I actually thought Fountainhead was good. Very good, actually. Perhaps not in all conclusions, and despite the preachiness of some of the protagonists, but still, I wish I had read this book sooner.

I think the book was almost Buddhist in its analysis of the world, except it seemed to reach the opposite conclusion: That the Ego is actually what is best about humans. And I think what the book's hero Howard Roark does and says was quite Stoic: He does not care about the opinions of others, he does not care if he has to do manual labor, he does not judge people superficially etc. At times reading about him was like reading ""Meditations"".

Anyway, there were things that I disliked about this book, but so far I think that Ayn Rand is being treated unfairly in popular opinion (as far as I can tell anyway).

Stoicism doesn’t make sense without God,"Let me address the elephant in the room and the area where I see the most confusion around Stoicism. And also why Stoicism especially appealed to me and made sense for me as someone with a Muslim background. 

If you study Stoic theology and ethics of good and evil you’ll see that Stoics believed virtue and vice comes from God. 

Stoics believe that God created a logical and virtuous universe and created the best logical conditions for us to live in:

>	The first sense of the definition [stoic ethics] is living in accordance with nature as a whole, i.e. the entire cosmos. Cosmic nature (the universe), the Stoics firmly believed, is a rationally organized and well-ordered system, and indeed coextensive with the will of Zeus, the impersonal god. Consequently, all events that occur within the universe fit within a coherent, well-structured scheme that is providential. Since there is no room for chance within this rationally ordered system, the Stoics’ metaphysical determinism further dictated that this cosmic Nature is identical to fate. Thus at this level, “living in agreement with nature” means conforming one’s will with the sequence of events that are fated to occur in the rationally constituted universe, as providentially willed by Zeus.

https://iep.utm.edu/stoiceth/

You have to understand that Stoicism is in direct opposition of Epicureanism at the time. 

Epicurus was the atheistic materialist philosopher. 

>	Ancient critics thought the Epicurean gods were a thin smoke-screen to hide Epicurus’ atheism, and difficulties with a literal interpretation of Epicurus’ sayings on the nature of the gods (for instance, it appears inconsistent with Epicurus’ atomic theory to hold that any compound body, even a god, could be immortal) have led some scholars to conjecture that Epicurus’ ‘gods’ are thought-constructs, and exist only in human minds as idealizations, i.e., the gods exist, but only as projections of what the most blessed life would be.

https://iep.utm.edu/epicur/#H3

So you can see the dichotomy here. 

The Stoics believed in a subjective, moralistic universe, and we just have to be objective to realize it and live with the inherent order and intelligence in it.

The Epicureans believed in an objective, “matter and void” universe, in we have to subjectively derive and project our values on it to enjoy our life. 

Many Stoics on these forums really aren’t Stoics but Epicureans. 

And really would be much better suited to study Epicurus and his teachings. 

Because Stoicism, without the inherent virtue of the universe, is rather empty. 

Stoics don’t discipline themselves merely to adapt to the hardships of life. 

But they believe in doing so, they become their best possible selves. 

The whole idea of overcoming one’s ego, the knee jerk reactivity of the psyche, is so one would be in tune with divine wisdom and live their life in the most virtuous way. 

Stoicism is most and foremost a philosophy of meaning. Of feeling proud and having a sense of belonging with the universe as a whole. 

It is not a philosophy of pain and pleasure. 

Pain and pleasure are merely seen as a veil standing in the way of true fulfillment and euodymonoa. 

I wish more people would study original sources or at least, credible sources, and not rely on a lot of pop culture, white washed explanations of Stoicism. Because they will end up with a broken philosophy that simply won’t work.",Stoicism,1672145658.0,t3_zwf0bf,0.35,0

What things are determine what things do. Is this true? What does stoicism have say to this?,"Here's the gist:

* Wise 16 year old gains consciousness 
* Doesn't know why he does what he does.
* Wonders ""what am I doing?"" and ""why am I doing it?
* What SHOULD I do and why SHOULD I do that?
* Wants a clear life direction.
* Tries to figure it out for months.
* Can't figure it out. Isn't satisfied with any answer. Finds despair instead.
* Has trouble doing anything cause of not knowing why he does what he does, or for that matter, why does ANYTHING at all do what they do?
* Reaches some sort of conclusion, which he still doesn't find satisfying so then asks reddit cause doesn't know where else.

~~~

The conclusion:

- Things just exists.
- These things exist in certain ways.
- The ways that these things exist can change.

This is reality.


What things are determine what things do, and what things do determine what things are to be.

ie. What a thing is and what surrounds that thing (the universe/ the earth/ society) determines what it does, and what it does determines what it becomes and what surrounds it becomes. 


If this is true, then:

What to do?
What you do is determined by what you are and what other things are.

Why do that?
What is done is done because of what you are and what other things are.

~~~

So is it that simple? I wake up, I eat, I bathe, I study, I draw, I choose a goal, I love, I survive etc. all because of what I am and what surrounds me? Is it logical?

How to not fuel relationship argument fires?,"Throwaway because too careful and never like to discuss things publicly.


And please no advice about breaking up the marriage, just save that please.   I love them thoroughly and entirely.


Need some stoic advise on dealing with high emotion relationship times.  Stoicism has helped greatly in my relationship but still not close to 100% (and nothing is…).  Not sure if there are some mantras or practices that could help, but a typical every 3-6 month argument goes:


1. Something triggers it, simple fake example: Tension is high and we both knock over milk.


2 . They get emotional and upset, cry and say mean things: “You are stupid you spilled the milk because you #$@!$ing clumsy.”


3. I get emotional and say mean things back: “No you are stupid, you are !@#!ing untidy and left it there!""


Now this is where the issue is. The argument now is about me cussing at them and calling them untidy.  For the next 3 days, they wont talk to me, crying, sad, sleeping on couch. To me, we were high emotions, tensions, they start cussing with accusations, and I return… I forgive them for saying I’m clumsy, what they said was a high emotional time, we were upset of the milk… But to them, now I’m the ""POS that called them untidy, this is unforgivable and now what the argument is about!”    


I’ve seen this pattern again and again, and try to walk away.  I go to stoic quotes on the reddit and internet, try to think deeply on it. Try to come to them and start healing sooner instead letting it dwell.  Stoicism has helped me greatly and I would say it’s taken the fuel out of a LOT of argument fires.  A possible 3 day fight is over in 2 hours… I love them.
 

But it's not perfect, and over the weekend we had another one.  This time I felt like I stayed calm, explained how I felt as calm as I could. but apparently It still hurt their feelings, and now we are both hurt on day 3, and the fight is now about the higher emotion argument.  This time they said I seemed mocking (I sometimes chuckle when in tense moments but thats nothing new).  I’ll own up to it, as I can see what they could have likely seen.  Especially if they are at a 10 on emotions and I’m at a 2 and trying to leave the room… But to me is all seems like a trap.   If someone yells at you, and if you yell back you are 10x more in trouble… Emotions are high and 1. 'Explaining it' has a high probability of being used against you.  2. ‘Leaving' is better but also bad.  3. ‘Letting them vent’ seems like safest but it puts all the stress on my capabilities which I lack (on top of having my own stressors and vulnerabilities).

Im a lost cause,"
I’m not suicidal but I’ve been on self improvement for such a long time and my life isn’t getting any better. It’s leading me to question why I am here and how can someone be so purposeless like me. 

Journaling, meditation, gratitude, and gym has been a very important part of my life for the past 7 months. 

My self esteem is still low, I still am scared of physical confrontation, I still daydream, I still am an incompetent individual, my mindset hasn’t changed and I don’t feel like my life has gotten any better. 

I’ve come to many realization over these past couple of months like how you can only do your best at the end of day as outcomes are out of our control but I still worry. I also know that my self esteem should be based on my efforts/attempts but I still prioritize results over everything. 

I know things will happen as they will happen and there is no point in writing these scripts in my head but I still engage in this endless spiral of overthinking each and every single day.

I know having a significant other won’t solve my mental issues but I still shoot my shot with other women and get rejected. And we know what happens when I get rejected I get down for sometime.

I’m starting to reach the conclusion maybe I’m just not capable of becoming better. I think something is wrong with me to the point no therapy or self improvement will be able to fix the mess I am. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to love and respect myself.

Are Stoics allowed to have opinions?,"Are stoics allowed to have opinions and judgments? The Daily Stoic says no. Wouldn't that mean a lack of empathy or compassion? Wouldn't that lead to feeling no desire to change the world. Can Stoics even be activists? Can they work in politics? Because this would imply they couldn't because they don't feel that one opinion is better or worse than another. Or that they don't have one at all and don't stand for anything. Like if one person says we should take care of our own health care and someone else says we should have universal health care, and I think one is right and one is wrong, then am I being un-stoic because I have an opinion and that I judge one view as bad and one view as good? The Daily Stoic stuff I've been reading says that we should not have an opinion. Like am I not able to have the opinion that the holocaust was bad, and that I think that those who think the holocaust was good are wrong? Like, not having an opinion, not having a judgment is, basically like seeing someone getting robbed and not thinking that what happened was bad and that the robbers are not bad and that stealing isn't wrong. And that the man didn't have something bad or wrong happen to him. I'm new to stoicism and everybody keeps saying this and I'm confused. I am an activist and a lobbyist. I go to marches and organize events and wish to one day work in politics to help make the world better. When I see something that I think is wrong, that's my opinion. Is that wrong to have an opinion, to see something happen and deem it wrong or cruel or bad? How can someone even be without an opinion? That's like saying, how am I suppose to not think pizza is better than broccoli and that we should feed our school children pizza instead of broccoli?

Anger out of and towards 'veganism'.,"Disclaimer: I have not studied veganism in much detail and cannot comment on whether 'anger' is a 'logical' consequence of following such philosophy. In this post I mean anger that people have out of and towards ideas that I roughly call 'veganism'. More on that below.

Dear fellow Students of Stoicism,

over time I hear increasing concern about the impact that humans have on the climate, on the system of life on Earth and about the way humans exploit other beings for their own material advantage. This is a bit of a controversial topic that can easily stimulate people to engage in 'destructive' dialogue. In line with this, I wish to share a few thoughts on the 'anger' and 'hate' that people cultivate regarding this topic.

Why do I write this post? I do not think that anger is a good thing: an ideal Stoic sage would not act out of anger, would he? Acting out of courage, a sense of justice, is not the same as acting out of anger, is it? Moreover, I do not like the concept of 'righteous anger'. I understand it, but do not like it. I think that virtue lies in *why* we make our decisions: specifically concepts as 'kindness', 'justice', 'courage', 'grace', 'forgiveness' and 'beauty' might be used to describe the beautiful intent of the sage that I admire.

Moreover, I do not think that ideal virtue aims at achieving external things for their own sake. In line with this, **I do not wish to force anyone to have specific views** on the matter of 'veganism' or the behaviour it entails. Instead, I wish to comment on the anger that I see coming from various regions on the spectrum of opinions. A few examples in this context:

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Understanding the 'hate' towards humans out of 'climate and animal concern'.** Here I mean 'hate' towards individual humans or the entirety of our species. In the context of the above, imagine a person 'hating' (many of) his fellow humans: imagine that his anger stems from pity for other beings that are being driven to (near) extinction through human conduct. Can we not understand that this person perceives this as unjust through his reverence for nature? *Is the perception of injustice not the best understandable reason for anger?*

In a similar example: can we not understand the 'anger' or resentment that someone might hold over the pain that is inflicted on animals in various industries? Is such anger at its core not a concern for the 'well-being' of other living things? If I may give a bit more of my personal opinion, I think that a human's 'concern' for beings other than himself is close to what I would call the best humanity has to offer.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Understanding the 'hate' towards 'vegans'.** Imagine someone feeling resentment towards 'vegans' or towards ideas such as 'veganism'. Imagine that this person believes that he needs to consume the way he does in order to support his 'well-being'. Can we in that case not understand that such a person feels fear because such ideas might (at some point in time) threaten his way of life?

Another aspect: can we not understand that people feel strong attachment to their (current) way of life, including their traditions? If people strongly propose ways of conduct that might hinder an individual's way of conduct, this can be perceived as 'something being taken away' from the individual. This in turn can be perceived as injustice. *Is the perception of injustice not the best understandable reason for anger?*

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus, since we are on-topic. **A note toward people who feel disheartened at the state of the world.** I agree that the human species is disrupting the system of life as we know it at a rapid rate. However, do not forget that we (or at least quite a few of us) humans are also trying to protect what life we may. It is not up to an individual to decide how everything turns out on a grand scale.

Ultimately, all life will end, no? What will it all have been 'good' for? Stoicism proposes that **virtue** is valuable for its own sake. I take the liberty to extend that also to our attempts at **virtue.** If you feel desperate, small and think that your impact on external things is so small that making any effort is not worthwhile, why not try to find value in the *attempt and struggle itself, remembering WHY you are making an effort?*

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Would an ideal Stoic not show clemency/forgiveness towards everyone, through his *understanding*? (Does not imply passivity.) Thank you for reading. Can you come up with related examples of anger/resentment that we may try to understand, such that we might progress a bit towards virtue?

An ode to our father god Zues the prime mover oh exhalted is thee above creation," Most glorious of immortals, Zeus  
The many named, almighty evermore,  
Nature's great Sovereign, ruling all by law  
Hail to thee! On thee 'tis meet and right  
That mortals everywhere should call.  
From thee was our begetting; ours alone  
Of all that live and move upon the earth  
The lot to bear God's likeness.  
Thee will I ever chant, thy power praise!  
For thee this whole vast cosmos, wheeling round  
The earth, obeys, and where thou leadest  
It follows, ruled willingly by thee.  
In thy unconquerable hands thou holdest fast,  
Ready prepared, that two-timed flaming blast,  
The ever-living thunderbolt:  
Nature's own stroke brings all things to their end.  
By it thou guidest aright the sense instinct  
Which spreads through all things, mingled even  
With stars in heaven, the great and small --  
Thou who art King supreme for evermore!  
Naught upon earth is wrought in thy despite, O God.  
Nor in the ethereal sphere aloft which ever winds  
About its pole, nor in the sea -- save only what  
The wicked work, in their strange madness,  
Yet even so, thou knowest to make the crooked straight.  
Prune all excess, give order to the orderless,  
For unto thee the unloved still is lovely--  
And thus in one all things are harmonized,  
The evil with the good, that so one Word  
Should be in all things everlastingly.  
One Word--which evermore the wicked flee!  
Ill-fated, hungering to possess the good  
They have no vision of God's universal law,  
Nor will they hear, though if obedient in mind  
They might obtain a noble life, true wealth.  
Instead they rush unthinking after ill:  
Some with a shameless zeal for fame,  
Others pursuing gain, disorderly;  
Still others folly, or pleasures of the flesh.  
\[But evils are their lot\] and other times  
Bring other harvests, all unsought--  
For all their great desire, its opposite!  
But, Zeus, thou giver of every gift,  
Who dwellest within the dark clouds, wielding still  
The flashing stroke of lightning, save, we pray,  
Thy children from this boundless misery.  
Scatter, O Father, the darkness from their souls,  
Grant them to find true understanding  
On which relying thou justly rulest all---  
While we, thus honoured, in turn will honour thee,  
Hymning thy works forever, as is meet  
For mortals while no greater right  
Belongs even to the gods than evermore  
Justly to praise the universal law!",Stoicism,1567191473.0,t3_cxl9dv,0.58,2
Is J. Cole a Stoic?,"I'm a big fan of Rap/Hip-hop, and it's easy to say that there are some conscientious rappers. Kendrick Lamar is an example. At the same time, almost 80% of what you hear is mostly talking about material success (which isn't necessarily negative). Being a follower of stoic thinking, I find most of these bling rap songs annoying because most of what they talk about aren't relatable.

Recently, I've dived heavily into J. Cole's discography and, I can't believe I haven't done it sooner. He seems like a down to earth dude who knows his own limits. This verse in Middle child really paints a picture of someone who really doesn't care what other people think: 

""The Bentley is dirty

My sneakers is dirty

But that's how I like it

You all on my dick""

&#x200B;

Then, when he's on the topic of why he would ever engage in a rap battle, he says some real shit:

&#x200B;

""It won't be 'cause my shit ain't selling the same

It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers

It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane

Everything grows

It's destined to change."" 

&#x200B;

When I listen to this verse, I instantly thought about Marcus Aurelius's Meditations. It may seem like a stretch, but I feel J. Cole embodies a lot of the principles Marcus speaks about. Many Stoic practiced going without luxurious items to remind themselves of humility. Cato the Younger would even dress in plain garbs to remind himself of stoic philosophy (kind of like how J. Cole wears basic clothing). It may just be me, but it's crazy that even though Stoicism started thousands of years ago, it's ideas live on even in today's celebrities even if unknowingly.",Stoicism,1566254303.0,t3_csong0,0.5,0

The Stoic Capitalist: Can We Pursue Both Virtue and Profit?,"""There may seem to be little overlap between the economic philosophy of capitalism and the ethical and spiritual discipline of Stoicism.

How to improve as a person when I just want to die ?,"
Please don’t just say “go to therapy” I’m already going to therapy and taking medication, it’s not a magical thing where I will have a Disney esque montage and be fine, it’s a process, a process that’s not working for me…

I don’t have a will to live no more, I’m 23 years old and I’m overweight, balding, living with my parents (or rather mom ), I have relationship issues with my parents, I don’t know how to drive, I’m going to a college that I HATE, I hate dental school with all my heart and I’m tired of lying to myself that I like it, I don’t have dreams, ambitions, hobbies… I’m tired 

I’m tired of everything, I wish that I could just kill myself and end it all but I don’t own a gun and I don’t want to make my friends and family sad 

Every since I was 14 years old I’ve felt this horrible depression and I’ve tried so hard to fight with it, I tried to learn stoicism and for a while it seemed to work but being a stoic is almost like being a superman you need to be better or try to be better at everything and I don’t know how to do it….

I want to improve i want to feel fulfilment, happiness, pride, etc, but I have tried so hard to change and improve in the past that I don’t know if I have a will and energy to try one last time",Stoicism,1697458603.0,t3_1794lyg,0.59,4
Stoicism - Should I be single or be in a relationship? How Can I apply Stoicism to my thinking here,"I made the decision to have a relationship break with my girlfriend (of 3 years) 6 months ago due to my petty desires and I did not want to do wrong by her. The break was my choice and it is not my girlfriends fault as she is an amazing person, emotionally mature and so easy to be with. She never pushed or rushed anything which I think is one of the main reasons I ended up naturally flowing into an exclusive relationship.  
Before I met my girlfriend I was dating multiple women and used to enjoy it. I having been battling the urges for a some time now and even though I had a good sex life with my girlfriend I could not stop wanting to be back out dating and having causal sex. I get a lot of attention when I go out which does not help the situation when I am trying to not make the wrong choices.

I have been following/practising Stoicism for a 4 months and although I am still very new to the philosophy  it has helped my life tremendously. I find the practise/application of Stoicism very easy when it comes to the other areas in my life even in times of stress but I cannot/do not know how to apply it in this area of my life. I am aware that I am letting desire control me and that this is stupid.

I am at a crossroads now where I want to make a decision. I would really appreciate any insight/wisdom anyone can share and how I can apply Stoic teachings to either help me make the right choice or to have a different viewpoint on how I am currently thinking.

Thanks",Stoicism,1663845139.0,t3_xkygir,0.57,3
My (f17) best friend (f17) won't talk to me because a guy chose me over her.,"Fist off, I know I messed up. I know I am in the wrong. I just want stoic advice on how to move on what to do next. 

Everyone in this story is 17. So me and my friend (I'll call her Emily) both know this guy (I'll him Ian). Emily and Ian have known each other for a while and I just started hanging out with them at the end of April. Emily used to have a crush on Ian but she told me she was over it when we all started hanging out.

When we hung out for the first time me and Ian both smoked weed and I got really horny and attracted to him. Weed usually does this to me so I figured it was just that and brushed it off the next day. Ian also said that he was talking to this girl he really liked so there was no point in me pursuing anything. The next day, Emily could not stop telling me that she thought I had a crush on Ian and was being really annoying about how obvious it was that I was eye fucking him when we hung out. THis really annoyed me but at the end of the day my feelings for him weren't resolved. She also kept trying to tell me that he liked me too but I thought she was just making stuff up so I didn't take her seriously.

Then a month later, I realized that I did have a HUGE crush on him because every time I saw him and spoke to him I would blush and get really embarrassed. So I told her, and she told me that I should absolutely go for it. She even said that he has been talking about how much he likes me for months even before we all hung out. This obviously made me very happy, but then last minute she tells me that she used to have a really big crush on him too but that she's over it now and gave me the green light to be with him. She also warned me that he may be exclusive with the girl he was talking about a month ago. I figured I wouldn't pursue him unless anything changes.

Fast forward to last week, I had them both over to my house and we had a few beers. His tolerance is crazy low because he has a history of drug abuse, so he got REALLY drunk super quick. One thing led to another and we're all on my bed and his head is on my stomach. Things got super weird. I didn't know if he was in a relationship and he wouldn't' t be upfront about it and every-time we got up to go outside or something him and Emily would whisper to each other. I remember I kept asking him to get off of me because I didn't want to be involved in his cheating but he wouldn't and would just climb on me more. Emily also kept leaving the room to go upstairs and was leaving us both alone. When me and Ian were alone I kept making stupid drunk conversation because I didn't think I could kiss him or make a move because he was in a relationship. And I was also getting upset about him and Emily whispering about me because I thought they were talking shit and I was feeling really insecure. Emily also kept texting me that she wanted to leave and walk home (she lived over a mile away and it was 1am so I told her to just stay). I eventually had to kick them out of my house because my dad would lose his mind if he found out a guy slept over.

The next day Emily calls me to debrief and tells me that he kept telling her to leave us alone so we can make-out and that he was fighting the urge the whole night. The only reason why he didn't want because of his relationship with this other girl. Then a few hours later Emily tells me that she needs space. I send her a long apology saying I'm sorry that she was in the middle of this whole thing and she responds saying that she still needs space. A few days later I call her and basically tell her it's not fair for her to cut me off just because this guy likes me, and that it's not my fault he wanted me. I also listened to her feelings and made sure to apologize for invalidating anything she felt. She then tell me that she still likes him which is why the whole situation sucks.

This is my best friend. Obviously I don't want to fight with Emily and I want to apologize, but she's mad at me for something that was out of my control. She told me it was ok to pursue him and then stopped talking to me when I did. What do I do?",Stoicism,1655353227.0,t3_vddcy9,0.43,0

Being powerful is answer to resentment and anger,"If a child or a homelsss person calls you names you would likely not get angry because you know that you are much more powerful than the child or homeless person. If your boss or your Professor unfairly criticizes you you are much more likely to feel angry because you don't have power over them. Resentment is caused by powerlessness more than the harm itself. So the solution lies in becoming powerful and improving yourself.

 As long as your inner self knows that
- you are improving, 
- are on path of becoming powerful,
- or are actively working towards removing your insecurity 

resentment will stay under control. Resentment is literally saying to you ""be powerful so that you do not need to not take revenge"".",Stoicism,1661576472.0,t3_wyu3v7,0.61,9

How do I deal with the hate of being a woman?,"I'm straight and attracted to men. But I wish I was born as a male. I hate being a straight woman.

I hate that I want kids. I hate that I have a limited number of years to be able to be pregnant without significant risk of complications due to postponed pregnancy. Therefore, I also have a limited number of years to find a partner who I am in love with and at the same time, want to have children before I go infertile. I hate that I feel like I have to rush dating because of this.

I hate that most birth control options are geared toward women and at the same time, have negatively affected the long-term health of many women. I hate that I'm mostly the one who will carry the consequences of an unplanned pregnancy. And abortion is freaking illegal in my country. And on top of that, the abortion mortality rate in my country is so high. I hate that I have to choose between possibly damaging my health due to birth control, possibly dying from abortion, stressing out because of doing something illegal (abortion), or possibly ruining my career plans because of an unplanned pregnancy.

I hate being a woman! Especially in my country!

I don't know how to think of these more healthily.

EDIT: I'm very sorry for this post sounding dismissive of men's problems. It's a mistake on my part. I think that raising children just became very important to me (I'm in my early 20s) to the point that I felt like I don't care about other aspects of life. I do sound like I am trying to avoid pregnancy (even if I'm saying I want kids) but in my defense, it's because I do not think I'm mentally, physically, and financially ready for it yet.",Stoicism,1670831126.0,t3_zjrn9a,0.74,361

"Is age regression as a man with ADD, GAD and infantile autism a problem?","Hey i have a lot og diagnostics, these 3. I combatted a lot of these with talking 5 min cold showers daily everyday in morning, I also try to run 3 kilometres everyday. I try to go to bed at 11 pm and wake up at 7 am. I drink coffee daily before 12 am, I also take ADD medication and anxiety medication. I write gratitude journal daily, as well as notes and I try to build on myself by doing various activities. Like reading, going to Gym, breathing exercises and more.

I still have addictions, I feel hyper sexual so i masturbait daily. I play computer a lot and I work as much as possible. I love working but my job, isn’t something that I can do daily. Because it’s sort of like a company that finds jobs for me where I can work, and if they need me I’ll be there.

But I also find that I tend to get more addicted to things, I constantly have tendencies of seeing myself as a man child even though I have been told I’m very mature. I seek attention, and I have over reactions and I worry a lot.

I feel like I can’t get out of this rut that I am in, I finished gymnasium. But idk, I feel like I’m inadequate and that I cannot be a man. Like all of my actions have been for nothing, I overcame depression and I finished gymnasium despite having undiagnosed ADHD, anxiety, depression and infantile autism.

Yet I feel like I never accomplished anything, I know I’m not nothing and I know that I’m valuable. But I constantly feel like I have no value, like no one think I’m anything but a mistake. I feel like I can’t be a man, almost like I never had a chance. I know I can do anything and that I can’t stay resilient through pain and suffering, stay composed and be a leader. But I’m constantly being reminded that I’m less valuable than people who haven’t accomplished anything. Idk why I believe that, but what can I do?

"Why are we certain that death is inevitable? (Bionics, mind uploading, or other sci-fi solutions)","Stoicism largely builds on the foundation of death being an inevitable thing. Even if you somehow avoid any external cause of death (murders, accidents, diseases, etc.), old age will still inevitably get you, so there is no point in fearing death.

However, science and technology progress at an incredible speed. So, I don't see any reason why some kind of brain cloning, or mind uploading, or bionics, or some other random futuristic concept that would allow humans to have theoretically unlimited lifespans (at least in terms of aging), couldn't eventually become a reality.

You may argue that the idea of immortality always has been plaguing humans' minds, with the ideas of the philosopher's stone, and similar. Smart people laughed at these ideas, and they were right. And I agree, these were stupid ideas. However, keep in mind that there is some bias to being a pessimist: you are either right or positively surprised. I am nearly certain that every existing modern technology would be considered to be impossible by people of the past. So, being skeptical of something doesn't mean that it is impossible. And I am not aware of anything that would rule out the possibility of overcoming aging with technological solutions (aside from the theories that claim that the universe will eventually die, like the heat death theory, but they all are very speculative theories).

So, why are we certain that the death is an absolute certainty? What if it isn't? What if there is even a veeeery tiny chance that we can eventually overcome aging due to technology? What if such technology could become possible within a reasonable amount of time? Why shouldn't we crawl into the deepest safest hole trying to maximize our survival rate in the hope of surviving until the technology becomes available? And then, once aging is overcome, develop a strategy for avoiding death indefinitely (clones, mind backups, interstellar travel, spreading across the universe, etc.).",Stoicism,1698172872.0,t3_17fjyiy,0.42,0

How to stop desiring women,"Im a single 31 yr old man, my whole life ive felt alone, sad, and sometimes depressed. My parents were verbally abusive to each other before they seperated after 25 yrs. I have always been alone, i never got a gf, not for the lack of trying via dating apps. I even went to south east asia, and paid for escorts just to not feel lonely, to feel like i have someone who pretends to like me for 1 hr, honestly that was a mistake.

I want to stop desiring women. I have been addicted to porn, now that has significantly reduced to just seeing some scantily clad women on instagram. I dont want to look at couples in restaurant or malls and feel sad and start crying. I dont want to think i am inferior or less human because im not attractive. I dont even want this though, like need to turn this feeling off.

"Social media toxicity, R/vegan, and what should I do.","So I am recently new to Reddit, again. I was on reddit back in  2012 to 2014, but stopped until this year. I like how Reddit is mostly more positive, especially compared to the toxicity of Facebook. 
I have found great communities from books, dogs, satellite radio fans, to philosophy.
But something recently left a bad taste in my mouth. I am vegetarian and try mostly for a vegan diet due to my morality with animals. Not preaching this is just my personal beliefs, but I feel this is important information for the story.
So anyways I also joined R/vegan.
I posted a few times on the subreddit and recently I posted an article entitled ""Veganism is in crisis, and the fanatics can only blame themselves"" and asked what the people what they thought of the criticism. Just because I was curious. I did not write the article.
But I would say about 40% to 45% started to attack me personally or my online persona I guess.
I like to think I have tuff skin and shit posters and trolls don't bother me, but this time it kind of did.
I was just asking what people thoughts were and to start a discussion. I didn't give my opinion of the article and I have been posting on the board for awhile. 
But almost half of them seemed mad at me, I tried to defend myself, but they didn't seem to care. After a few responses I realized I was just wasting my time and deleted my post and blocked a few people. 
I had my wife look at the post and she says it did not look offensive or anything like that, but I do admit she could be biased.
I was really starting to like Reddit with the discussions. But R/vegan makes me question if I should give up social media in general. I don't know. 
I like the discussions, but I am getting to old to deal with shit posters all the time. I am not sure if this was a one time fluke, a vegan thing (I am not unrealistic, I know how they can be sometimes), a reddit thing, or just people...

I've been taking my true friends for granted and kinda abandoned them to chase the possibility of someone else," 

Recently I caught myself falling for a girl that I realistically could never have because she was already dating someone. 

We got along super well, we hung out a lot , we talked a bunch, but in the end shes taken and I respect that. I learned a lot about myself during the few months I had with her but she moved away and now its over.

I never even really tried to push for a romantic relationship I just wish we were closer friends but it is what it is. 

Logically I understood the situation and fallout but emotionally I couldn't prevent myself from causing my own heart break.

I also realized that during these few months I was somewhat ignoring my close friends, the people that I already had deep connections and history with and the people that really care for me. 

And weirdly I don't know why but It doesn't feel enough... 

For some reason my brain seems to think the one thing I cant have is more important to the things I already have. Again, logically it makes sense. But emotionally it doesn't. I cant help but take those I have for granted and instead waste my time on something I don't have, on something that MIGHT be a POSSIBILITY... 

I feel shitty because I did kinda upset those that cared for me. I feel shitty because I couldn't get what I wanted with her. And I feel shitty because now what I do have doesn't seem as good or powerful as what I could have had with her.",Stoicism,1698566232.0,t3_17iy2wk,0.5,0
Is there a darkness to Stoicism in regards to Roman society?,"My interest in Stoicism started a couple of years ago during a period where I was going through a difficult situation which I am born into. Reading the Enchiridion really helped me and since then I have tried to practice Stoicism. It has helped me very much and I have kept reading Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius. 

Especially one message from Enchiridion has helped me. It goes along the lines that life is a play and you are given a role, you are not the author nor the director and you can only play the role your  give as best you can. 

Life was of course difficult in ancient Rome, even for the wealthy, and I can imagine that the reasoning above would help people cope with hardships. But considering that around 5-10% of Rome's population were slaves the ""be happy with your lot""-message, although helpful to the individual, appears to me that it could be an instrument of oppression. So, was Stoicism the ideology of the Romans?

I also want to add that even though a society has an ideology the actions of it's leaders and institutions must of course not align with that ideology. Something which is apparent through history. Just look at all the countries with the term ""democratic"" in their names. So even if there is a lot of good in Stoicism, the fact that it comes from such an imperial society makes me doubt it. 

Additionally the actions of stoic philosophers like Marcus Aurelius and Seneca also makes me doubt Stoicism somewhat. I mean Marcus Aurelius was in charge of an empire that went to war regularly and persecuted religious minorities.  Seneca was a shrewd politician and a businessman which also puts me off. 

I also want to be clear that we cannot and should not judge people and societies through the lens of our modern values. Everything evolves and progresses, so too values. I am not judging, I am just questioning if it is good to adopt their ideology, or philosophy if you prefer that term.  

In conclusion, because of these thoughts I have gone from being completely positive towards Stoicism and seeing it as the answer to life, to being more sceptical. 

I'd love to hear the thoughts of this insightful community. ",Stoicism,1697720200.0,t3_17bihwu,0.56,2
Stoicism Is Impossible,"I feel like I have been in a constant state of survival and overthinking throughout my entire life. Recently, it has been getting worse as I continue to grow. It seems like there are always new things that come up and stress me out, whether it's university, work, expectations, family, or other people's opinions. Every time I make a mistake, I seem to regress even further. I'm reaching a point where I can't handle things as well as I used to. I used to be strong and resilient, but this constant cycle is draining my energy, affecting my health, and undermining my sanity. It feels like I'm trapped in a loop with no way out. I try to adopt a stoic mindset, but then something else comes up and I start berating myself, regretting my decisions and actions. I wish this could all be over.

Which philosophy is right for me? I can’t seem to make stoicism fit my personality. What other options are there?,"I’m a 50 yo married man who left Mormonism and became atheist about 10 years ago. I’ve genuinely tried to embrace stoicism, but I don’t feel like I’m a good fit for many of the aspects. I can certainly do an a’la carte version, which is what I currently do, but I still embrace a lot of hedonic practices that I just don’t want to give up. 

I always want to be better than I am. I am never satisfied with being satisfied. I always want more and to grow. I’m always chasing the next thing. Being still and tranquil for too long is disquieting and feels like being prepared for death. I don’t want to ever stop exploring and improving even if it causes me pain. But I still want to find rest-stops along the way when I need them to recharge. 

I use other people (as ethically as possible) as tools to help refine me. I hate meeting new people, but I know that it’s only by socializing that I can chisel away at myself. I do measure myself against others.

Meditating on Ukraine-Russia war a bit,"Hello everyone, things are horrible right now and I am sorry for being one of the posts to touch on this crises that reminds the atrocities that are being done by the Russian-Kremlin-USSR forces. 

I want to begin by saying that I am taking a side against Russia and its forces that are committing uncalled war on Ukraine and the rest of Europe. There is no question as to who is the aggressor, but what was right in the past or present, I am not taking that side. Just against Russia as many significant historical events and current geopolitical tensions are out of my reach to discuss. I believe the same goes for 99% of redditors, so please have a breadth of thought and Yutori in your thinking before you call my mistakes or others’ that currently does not matter at this point. 

I want our western allies and the people who are against Russian invasion to look more deeply into the fall of USSR. More specifically, understand and familiarize yourself with why USSR fell. Not to make any judgments, just familiarize and drench yourself in what had happened. What forces were at play and who were the originators. 

I found the autobiography of Gorbachev to be the answer. How he grew up, where he grew up, who held control, what people stood up against, and why. This will give us the right feeling of unification among people who are against Russian invasion and strategic plans for the future. 

I believe that by as stoically as we can, understanding from within through the eyes of Gorbachev, we will see and understand what Russia truly is. We need to identify the true aggressors and condemn them, but not Russia itself. Because of mass misunderstanding of what Russia was and is, there hasn’t been a development in the right direction at all. There can be no war if everyone actually understood everything fully in its entirety. We didn’t before, and we are paying for this orchestra that we did not pay for: today. 

Let us analyze everything in its entirety. Again, the way Gorbachev saw the world, let us try to see that world through his eyes and make judgments that are called for today. Not judgments of mass hysteria nor reactions to misconducts that were looming to arrive in the past few decades. We can end it if can understand it fully. And if we can understand it fully, we can push this knowledge to take its rightful stage. 

Let’s uncover Russian lamentation done by the USSR for the past century and make this a common knowledge that people have tried and failed what Putin is trying to achieve for the past hundreds of years done by rulers and dictators.

A free world cannot be recognized without the existence of bondage. Let us recognize the originator, what is constricting us? Why do we feel the need to be free? Because we’re all bondages one way or another right? 

Time and time again I’ve seen Stoics break their bondages because what we truly value is something we already have. We just don’t like losing it. The time has come for someone to take that from you whether you know you have what you want or not. Time for our minds to unite and break this enigma of rampant misinformation and forced ignorance done by powers looking to steal what you already have. 

Let’s expose everything with our minds. We can help. We can do something. I do not know for sure but understanding seems to be the first. 

I am going to be honest with you, I’m not even 1/4th done with the autobiography I’m asking people to read. It was just that insightful in its first hundred pages during this current times. I don’t know how it ends nor what its true message is. Yet, I still believe.

Responsible concealed carry: how stoicism helps,"Hey all,
I don't usually post, but today I noticed an important way stoicism has helped me daily. I just recently turned 20, and living in Idaho, I can legally concealed carry a firearm anywhere in the state. I do this for self defense and to defend those around me. When carrying a firearm, you have to be especially careful with your temperament and be able to effectively defuse situations. Drawing my gun is something I hope I'll never have to do, and it's an absolute last resort. Stoicism has helped me stay calm in almost any situation, even just in everyday life. I used to let emotional distress take control of me when I was younger. Ever since I've taken on the stoic mindset, I have been calm and collected 100% of the time, no exceptions. I only started carrying a firearm recently and I think it's an absolute necessity to be calm at all times while doing so. Even without drawing it, if there's a heated (nonviolent) disagreement in public, it certainly isn't good to also be armed in case the police get involved.

Gun owners: understand that you must be calm at all times while armed. Stoicism is the way.

Need help resolving anger towards repeated stupidity committed by my wife.,"So it's 4:23am for me right now. I have a final exam on quantum mechanics tomorrow, and I can't fall back to sleep because a fan in the bathroom fell down 2 hours ago. Why would a fan fall down you ask? Well, there's been smoke smell coming into the bathroom of our apartment. After trying everything to no avail, I decided to just seal the fan with duct tapes and it worked. The smoke smell stopped. But then my genius wife still kept turning on the sealed fan for the past few weeks, despite me telling her that it makes no sense. So tonight, once again, her stupidity culminated to waking me up the night before my super important exam. (After I was so very careful with my sleeping schedule for the past few months or so no less.)

Well, maybe now you're thinking that it's probably not a big deal. People make mistakes...well, my wife here just could not understand how to keep the printer ink stocked no matter how many times I try to teach her, keeps locking herself out for 7 times in a row, drops her phone into the toilet and having to pay for repair multiple times...these examples are just the tip of the iceberg...would take too long to list all of her blunders...though some of them are actually kind of funny. Anyways, you get the gist.

So right now I'm just like at the end of my rope here. Trying to act stoic and push down my anger. Still, it's just so very hard. This time I actually did not yell at her when it happened and calmly fixed the fan again.

Ryan holiday and taxes,"Hi,

I'm sure most of you are familiar with Ryan Holiday and the impact he's had on introducing us to Stoicism. I'm thankful for that.

On that note there are two things that lead me to believe this guy is a shill and only promotes stoicism for financial reasons. 

The first is how he put up a post on his Instagram about how to be thankful/accepting of taxes. This is dangerous territory. I'm generalizing here but I'm sure most of us feel we are taxed way to much. I feel like hes saying it's okay the government takes this much money from us, it's what is and we should just deal with it. 

The second, on his Instagram pages he occasionally puts up images of him giving the bird to statues in the south. For some reason this really stuck with me. What's your take? 

Thirdly, I cant stand how the guy sells us a coin to promote stoicism.  it just doesnt feel right.

Stoic view on having a fwb?,"I (24M) was at a party last week bumped into a 22F who I dated for a few months a couple of years ago. We hit it off and things happened.

It was great and we’re seeing each other next week to do it again.

How do I not care about offensive jokes people make in uni?,"(21 F) It’s my first year in uni and I would say I’m a really social person.

So I met this one guy who was with a girl and they’re both really friendly. This guy and I come from the same country in North Africa and have been making a lot of jokes at each other in a light manner until until he started going after my appearance by saying my forehead was big and saying I have “googly eyes” (for wearing glasses) even though we both wear glasses and have big foreheads. I just laughed it off but him and the girl could tell I was affected by it so they said I was laughing in pain and he apologized. I told him I didn’t care and he was like “the insults I just told you were the tip of the ice berg, I could go more but I won’t do that” I could’ve insulted him for having acne but I’m not that type of person. 

I really want to learn how to stop taking these jokes seriously especially targeted at appearance but I don’t know how. I want to learn how to at least hide the fact that I am upset, I don’t like showing weaknesses.

Sexual history,"What are stoicism’s thoughts on judging a partner on his or her sexual history. 

My friends with benefits relationship has turned to a committed relationship as of recently. 

I recognise this relationship has comparatively poor foundation since till some time it has been based on pure physical intimacy. 

But we have fallen in love and I feel the change in our relationship from just lust to lust and love. 

I am however concerned with her sexual past. 

She has had one fling in the past which is bothering me.

She had this fling to get over me since i had a fling too, i was an asshole to her which i have changed since then.

The reason it’s bothering me are the following . 

I will dive deep and be completely honest about what they are.

I am afraid as she has done it once she might cheat on me.


It’s an irrational thought but it is there. 

I guess it has to do with my upbringing and beliefs. 

I am actively trying to challenge this feeling so that it is replaced or atleast accompanied by another realistic one. 

She has not cheated on her one bf she had. 

It is my insecurity and has nothing to do with her but still I genuinely fear that a girl with a history of fling is a risk. 

My lack of sexual experience might have to do something with this insecurity 

It would help to surround myself with some open minded people but sadly people around here don’t talk much about this stuff since it’s considered a taboo to talk about sex. Therefore I feel alone in feeling this , like I am the only one having these doubts and thoughts.

Would Stoic kill Hitler?,"I know the title is a bit controversial, so let me explain.

We believe there are no bad or good people, just those who follow Nature and those who do things on external influences and bad judgments, thus not following Nature and not fulfilling their potential. 

Killing someone is also not a very Stoic thing *per se* \- how can taking someone's life make me virtuous? And if I believe there are no bad or good people with killing someone (that would outside of Stoic circles be considered ""bad"") I essentially stop that person from potentially fulfilling their potential and giving up bad judgments, and aligning himself with Nature.

BUT - then again what greatly differentiates Stoic from Sceptic is that we believe we must do things that are not only making us virtuous but also making our surroundings a better place. We don't run from society, we want to make society as a whole a better place.

&#x200B;

So that brings me to Hitler part - is it a Stoic way to kill someone that is affecting the lives of so many people, whose bad judgments are resulting in the death of other people and thus his actions are essentially preventing others (in this case millions) from following their Nature, their Virtue (being taking their lives, or affecting someone who finds no virtue in killing someone in a way that he must join the army and kill other men that he have no reason to). 

On one hand, is it not in my power to decide how and what some dictator will do, but on the other hand, if there was an opportunity for me to end the suffering of society and millions of people by killing a dictator then making society a better place IS IN THAT CASE IN MY POWER.

Every day we texted, met up, even kissed… all this for 1 and a half year. She always told me how much she loved and missed me while i was at work…Called me baby…and so here it comes. When i told her if she wants to be my girlfriend..She said that she didn’t know i view her that way. That i love her that way. She said that she thinks she does not love me the way i love her…That she viewed me as a friend the entire time…But that she meant everything she said?

The Ten Equations That Rule The World,"I just finished fascinating audiobook called ""The Ten Equations That Rule The World"" by David Sumpter, and I wanted to share it with you all. While it may not be directly related to Stoicism, I found some interesting parallels between the mathematical principles discussed in the book and our Stoic philosophy.

Stoicism teaches us to cultivate virtues like wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance, enabling us to navigate life's challenges and achieve inner peace. Similarly, this book explores ten equations that provide mathematical frameworks for understanding different aspects of our world.

By delving into these equations, the author sheds light on fundamental principles that govern areas such as economics, population dynamics, quantum mechanics, and more. While this may seem far from our usual Stoic discussions, I found that the analytical and systematic approach presented in the book resonated with our philosophy.

Stoicism encourages critical thinking, self-reflection, and the pursuit of knowledge. ""The Ten Equations That Rule The World"" offers a similar intellectual journey, inviting us to explore the underlying truths and patterns that shape our reality.

By engaging with these mathematical concepts, we can sharpen our analytical skills, expand our understanding of the world, and develop a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of all things – a perspective that aligns with Stoic principles.

So, if you're interested in exploring the intersection of mathematics, science, and philosophy, I highly recommend giving ""The Ten Equations That Rule The World"" a read. It's an enlightening journey that may provide fresh insights and complement our Stoic practices.

Stay curious and keep cultivating those virtues, my fellow Stoics!",Stoicism,1684458449.0,t3_13lgo29,0.57,3
I fumbled a 10/10,"My story is tragic, I just can't get over it. Let me tell you. There's this girl at school and I've had a crush on her for 2 years now. For 1 year, I tried to exchange some glances with her, passing by her in the hallways and finding her extremely beautiful. She never looked at me, it seemed like she didn't notice me. 

I have a certain amount of self-esteem and I don't want to force anything anyway, so I tried to forget about her. So after the first whole year of trying to exchange glances, I finally stopped and for another year, I moved on and almost forgot about her. However, a month ago, I don't know why or how, but she started looking at me with what seemed like passion, every day. 

At first, I thought I was imagining it and didn't pay her any attention, but it became more and more obvious. Nevertheless, I decided not to do anything, so I didn't go talk to her, but one day we took the same bus and she just stared at me the whole way. When I got off the bus, I started walking towards my house, and then I heard footsteps behind me and felt a tap on my shoulder. I turned around and it was the girl in question. She literally asked me for my number. I couldn't believe it, so I acted in probably the worst way a human being can react. 

I had my headphones on and pretended not to hear her. I just continued on my way without even responding to her or looking her in the eye, even though she had the courage to come up to me, a courage that I never had. I don't know how she took it, but I really messed up. I was scared, and that fear betrayed me. Maybe I deserve it, probably. What's really sad is that for some external reason, maybe for professional or family reasons, I don't know, she left school a week ago. 

I probably will never see her again. I still remember when she asked me for my number, she was really the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life, she had a smile, she was gentle, and I didn't do anything, nothing. Whatever anyone might say, I will live with the doubt, from time to time, I will remember that moment, I will think about it late at night, and what if I had acted?",Stoicism,1680124618.0,t3_1260znm,0.58,3

God’s Love & Meaningful Suffering,"The two main points of life are to love and to suffer. This is symbolic in Jesus’s journey. 

Jesus loved us in a way that only God could. Jesus suffered for us in a way that only God could. Jesus conquered death. The wage of sin is death. Jesus conquered sin. His suffering allowed God’s Love, the blood of Christ, to wash over us. 

Suffering is inevitable on earth. Living by sin leads to empty &amp;amp; meaningless suffering. God’s love is the only true salvation from this suffering. Though we will still suffer, internalizing his love is all we need to fully love &amp;amp; accept ourselves and our situations. When that happens, the acceptance and love shines like a light for others. 

No short term desires compare to a relationship with God. It’s not about being perfect. The right things do themselves when fully conscious of God’s love and presence. Even if the right thing causes more suffering, God’s love will triumph over any suffering as you surrender to a full consciousness of him.

Actions against terrorism.,"So terrorism is caused largely, nowadays by Islamic extremists. Cato of Utica took up arms against Caesar because he felt that having Caesar in power would be detrimental to the freedom of Rome.
Marcus Aurelius conducted numerous military campaigns in old Europe. Even Socrates was a war hero before he became the father of western philosophy.

Serious question now; Should we do the same?
Islamic extremists threatens the stability of the western civilization. They knowingly and tactically use our freedoms against us. 

I believe as stoics dedicated to a cosmopolitan world, we are tasked with doing all in our power to change this (if nothing else prevents us) although of course, we should be indifferent to the outcome (death, exile, torture etc). Either that, or we should merge the collapse of western civilization and our own painful deaths into our personal premeditation of adversity practices.

"Women are not capable of ""extreme leadership"" due to being ""more emotional and irrational""? I find this questionable.","[https://youtube.com/shorts/XzB8nqFM61g?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/XzB8nqFM61g?feature=share)

I came across this, watched it out of morbid curiosity, and found it baffling. I also argued with one commenter about famous female leaders. In short (and from what I can remember), he argued about how the most beloved either defaulted to their ruling husbands; single rulers not striving for proper successors; and those such as Margaret Thatcher waging war on sovereign nations over small gains. He also spouted that female brains cannot overcome the innate differences they have from men such as being ""more prone to shouting and crying"".

I argued that many women are capable of controlling their emotions (in fact, the image I have seen with associated with mature femininity is a sagely and dignified lady no matter how tense a situation is) and that countless male rulers were/are just as guilty of petty and immature deeds. (And what I find richly ironic is that the commenter said he was from Russia, where the women there are ""more mature than American women but still pale to Russian men"". Meanwhile, his male ruler is waging war that he's struggling with but is too stubborn to cut his losses)

I just don't get where people get the idea of women being less emotionally stable and incapable of leading in tense situations.

With that said, I have this nagging feeling that my life is a wasted one. While I’ve made real attempts to change from who I once was, I grew up a very fake kid. Alone at home but acted like he was perfect at school. My dad passed when I was young, and it was very hard to be positive growing up. My brother went down a bad, bad rabbit hole and my mother was working her ass off. I became the hope of the family. They had no time for me and I understood that. So I stayed in school, didn’t do drugs, friends with the right people. This was all until end of sophomore-junior year high school. Those years are important because I hit a total shift

I went through a break up with my girl. It was the fact I lost her through my FAKE attitude. She didn’t know what was going on with me because I never wanted her to know. I ended up getting too comfortable and my emotions + lifestyle rubbed off on her. She didn’t wanna break up either, but she couldn’t stand to see me change so mysteriously (in her eyes). And I understand that, imagine your lover unexpectedly acting different than usual. 

I started skipping school, purposely doing bad/but just enough to pass, I did drugs. Not because it was fun, but because my brother would do them so I said why not. Obviously, it helped me COPE with my problems.  I ended up making a lot of bad decisions. I became someone with EGO and filled with hate. I was no longer nice, it was petty. 

I turned quiet, I started to embrace the bad side of me because it felt like it was me against the world. It made me feel powerful when it really was a way to cope with my shitty feelings everyday.  

I almost made the attempt to kill myself with pills. I couldn’t do it. I love my mom, and I couldn’t stand to put that pain for her. She doesn’t know that. Fast forward im in college, isolated. Covid. I almost made the attempt once again. I called my mom to drop something off so I could see her and when I did, I changed my mind. 

I came home shortly after that and didn’t go back to my dorm the whole year.

THIS is when I decided to start changing. I got diagnosed for bipolar disorder and depression etc. but I’m not taking those those pills….I started a holistic and spiritual journey which helped a lot. It’s turned me into someone I can have some respect for. It turned me towards god and I discovered the power of following good morals. 

Yet, I don't know how to deal with this. It’s the fact i live this life now due to my fuck ups that still eats me. Im not happy I just learned how to deal with it. I would be lying if I told you everything is okay apart from my self love journey. I’m still in debt, working 9-5 in college at home while people are heading into their careers. I’m still confused in my life. Im still alone at home because my mom and I don’t talk. It’s hard since she’s a foreign parent. My family are in one big feud, and I don’t have cousins or even my brother to talk to. I have friends but they only know me from a surface level. I’ve been lucky to have 2 friends who cared about me. I still think about that girl I dated 5 years ago. I’ve never dated someone since and I don’t think I will. I also lost some people as friends. 

I am at a serious loss...why is it so hard for us to be happy? Why is this world built to make us stressed!",Stoicism,1695237777.0,t3_16ntzao,0.67,22
TIL I am a stoic,"I am a 28 year old dude and I did not know until today about Stoicism. I have been practicing it naturally though since I was a child. I didn’t cry when my dog died. I had such a ecstatic moment when I realised I can actually read books about something that resonates with my line of thoughts. Generations of books unlocked with the right search term. I am thankful that I found this community. 

I have been called indifferent towards life countless times. I am currently going through a breakup (peacefully) and it troubled me so much as how I can be this calm about the entire thing.

Stoicism comes dangerously close to nihilism,"I recently read the Practicing Stoic, which encouraged me to revisit Meditations and the writings of Seneca. As an atheist, Stoicism appeals to me as a way to check my own beliefs and thoughts. And honestly, that's one thing I miss about religion.

Yet, I also think that a partial adherence to stoic teachings could lead to bad outcomes. Specifically, the teachings on detachment and death, and treating  others how you wish to be treated. I've always took issue  with the ""golden rule,"" because many people treat themselves like shit and allow others to treat them poorly as well.

Take for example, Achilles in the Iliad. Achilles knows that he will die in Troy, and he accepts his impending death with stoic detachment. He brings this up when a soldier begs him to spare  his life. Achilles has no problem killing the unarmed, begging soldier, because he knows he himself will soon meet the same fate. (Of course, he is very un-stoic in his whining and attachment to Patroculus) 

I also see this in more tragic circumstances, like Columbine. One part of that horrific event that really stuck with me was right before the pair committed suicide, they stopped shooting at students. They may have suddenly developed a conscience, but I dont think so. I think they more likely grew bored with  it all, and that they remained detached through the entire ordeal. I think their detachment and acceptance of their own impending doom allowed to them to commit these atrocities. Like Achilles (not in  the heroic sense, of course), they aren't phased by victims pleading for their lives. They will soon blow their own brains out, so it's no big deal to them. 

All of this to say, while I love the Practicing Stoic Handbook, my biggest gripe with it is that it starts with Stoic detachment to pleasure,opinions, etc., and doesnt address Virtue until nearly the end of the book. I find this irresponsible. I would encourage anyone who wishes to study stoicism to first study virtues like courage, honor, and humility before tackling detachment. Detachment without virtue is dangerous, in my opinion.",Stoicism,1634250109.0,t3_q8a2dg,0.7,69
Stoicism & Polyamory/Non-Monogamy,"Let me start by saying that I love this community, it has really been incredibly helpful while studying and practicing stoicism in my life. So first, let me say thank you all for your wisdom!
But I’ll be honest, I’m a little disheartened and kind of surprised by some of the discussions here in response to the Will Smith/Chris Rock incident last night, but what concerned me are the attacks at Will/Jada’s relationship style instead of the action itself. 

There is a lot of hate/judgment being thrown around regarding Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith’s alleged open marriage. Many are (negatively) calling him a cuck, emasculated, etc. which I don’t think is fair and I definitely don’t think is accurate (if anything, it makes him stronger than someone who can’t handle hearing their girlfriend thinks Chris Evans is hot). I also find it confusing how anyone who is practicing or even interested in stoicism would feel compelled to judge a man who - to my knowledge - is not a practicing stoic. People are gonna people and all we can do is care for our own little patch of grass, no one else is our business. 

We live in a society where we are socialized to believe that after we meet someone we even remotely like we need to only have eyes for them - and we can’t even acknowledge to our partner that we think the waiter/waitress is attractive. Biologically, we are not wired for monogamy. But for some reason (most likely religion), monogamy is considered normal/the default people enter into instead of doing it with intent and consciousness. That being said, I personally identify as polyamorous, but I do not advocate/am not advocating for anyone to open up their relationships without direct, conscious intention - many open up in response to something (cheating, boredom, to fix their marriage, etc.) which is foolish and a bandaid that rarely works. 

Practicing stoicism next to polyamory has helped me unlearn so many toxic ideals about what love between two people can be. It’s helped me process my feelings of inadequacy and jealousy when my partner is with someone else. I put far less pressure on my partner to be everything for me (best friend, lover, etc.) and rely more on myself as I realize I’m all I’m in control of. All of this to say, I just think it’s important and my obligation to give at least a little bit of the other side of the coin as I haven’t found much of the pro-non-monogamy side on this page. 

In posting this, I realize that I am making my own judgments about you and your ideals, and for that I apologize. Know that that is not my intention. I just think it’s important to get some perspective from someone you might not hear from on a regular basis. Hopefully this helps you think a little more critically when you see someone operating outside of way you live your life.

She’s always talking loudly, complaining about everything, treating her own mom like garbage, always fat shaming me, she doesn’t accept that I’m bisexual (I had to break up with a great guy because of her), she’s a hypocrite, an alcoholic, she doesn’t listen to my arguments, she never listens to me, she makes it super clear that she wanted another son who would follow everything that she wants, everything needs to be her way, she doesn’t respect my boundaries and limitations, is always calling me weird even tho my psychiatrist told to her face that’s likely that I’m on the autistic spectrum, she’s always hammering in that I didn’t get my driver’s license after failing the exam for the first time, she doesn’t want to pay for my medications, she forced me to go to a college that I don’t like (she literally matriculated me there without my consent), she’s always doing things behind my back and telling me moments prior until the event happens, making me super anxious, she thinks that I’m faking being depressed and anxious….

How to manage stress in gaming (and in general)?,"I'm a young man getting slowly into stoicism. It is like 4th day since i started reading about it more (I'm still in the middle of reading one of William B. Irvine's books, it's my first). I like playin a lot of dynamic, stressful games like e.g. ULTRAKILL. I think im playing rationally - trying some tactics, doing stuff to manage problems (prioritizing enemies, defending yourself etc.). Nontheless tend to feel a lot of stress. At first i was still raging, hitting my desk, but today i felt a bit of a progress - i was still very stressed, i sometimes felt angry, however i remained calm and ""took a deep breath"" and went ahead. It might be also be caused by the fact i'm at my grandma and i don't want to make noise.
This applies to even some activities. In fact, i feel stress rn writing this (dunno why exactly tho). After trying to imply Irvine's suggestions in my daily life i feel better - i usually felt like people want the worst for me and they treat me as someome worse. Nowadays i feel less affected, like i don't care. Only time i felt bad was when my friend called PlayStation 3 gay (yes, he has xbox lmao) as i have huge nostalgia for this console.
What i want to ask in summary - is there a way to calm myself down after a big dose of stress and is it bad for me, as a stoic, to feel stressed in gaming?",Stoicism,1704558937.0,t3_1903u81,0.5,0

The issues I had trying to apply stoic principles,"This year I started my stoic journey and I've been enjoying it so far. I feel better overall, but the thing I like the most about stoicism is that I have guidance or some sort of ""framework"" on how to behave on any given situation, which facilitates making tough decisions.

One issue I struggled with for some time is knowing what would be ""the stoic way"" to handle certain scenarios I faced in my life. And this was an issue for two reasons:

1. I would have to search for a specific teaching/quote/insight on stoic books that would relate to the situation I'm going through. This is not easy since most stoic books (at least the most popular ones) aren't structured in an organized way. They're mostly just a bunch of teachings with no particular order or association to a specific subject.
2. Once I found some quote or teaching, it was hard to clearly understand the underlying message. I'm kind of new to philosophy, so most times the language used was difficult for me to understand.

So I ended up building an app that would help me with that. I'm not intending to do self-promotion so I wont share any particular details, but I imagine if its helping me now, it can potentially help others.

So I would like to know what people practicing Stoicism think about the concept and what I could do to make it useful to others, so I can share it through the appropriate channels.

It works as follow:

1. You enter some situation you're going through your life. Could be anything, from minor things that happen on your day-to-day to more meaningful situations that affect your overall wellbeing.
2. The app scan through a set of stoic books looking for quotes or teachings that relate to your scenario.
3. Using AI, the app display's the following:
   1. The quote extracted from the books, exactly as it was taken from the source.
   2. The quote explained in plain english. No complex or ancient language, the quote is explained as a friend would explain it to you.
   3. An explanation of how a stoic would handle the situation you're going through. Everything based on the quote mentioned in point no. 1.

# Example

**My scenario:**

*I'm working on expanding my social circle and building meaningful friendships. It's not easy for me to connect with new people and maintain those relationships since I'm very shy*

**The quote taken from books:**

*Judge no speech or action unworthy of you which is consistent with nature. Be not dissuaded by any consequent criticism or censure from others; but, if the speech or action be honourable, judge yourself worthy to say or do it. Those who criticize you have their own conscience and their own motives. These you are not to regard, but follow a straight course, guided by your own nature and the nature of the Universe, both of which point the same way.*

**The quote explained:**

Do not let the opinions or criticisms of others discourage you from pursuing actions that are in line with your own nature and the nature of the Universe. If your intentions are honorable, consider yourself worthy of engaging in those actions or expressing those thoughts. The judgments and motives of others should not influence your decisions, as they have their own perspectives and motivations. Instead, stay true to yourself and follow the path that aligns with your nature and the greater order of the Universe.

**The quote in the context of my scenario:**

In your scenario of expanding your social circle and building meaningful friendships, it is important to remember that you should not let the shyness or potential criticism from others deter you from connecting with new people. The quote emphasizes that you should not judge your own actions or words as unworthy simply because they may be met with criticism or disapproval. Instead, if your intentions are genuine and honorable, you should consider yourself worthy of making the effort to connect with others and build meaningful relationships. The opinions and judgments of others should not hinder your pursuit of social connections, as they have their own perspectives and motivations. Stay true to your own nature and the natural inclination for human connection, and do not let external factors discourage you from taking action.

"Stoic advice for friendship, unrequited love, and loss?"," 

Hello everyone, I need some Stoic advice on how to deal with friendship, unrequited love, and impending loss. I apologize; I am somewhat of a lapsed Stoic, as I've been out of practice for a while now. I can see where my mistakes are, but I need advice and resources on how best to correct them.

Here's the story. I met a guy; we're both in college, and we quickly became friends over the last year. Slowly, I began having romantic feelings for him, culminating in me asking him out. He kindly refused and said he would rather stay friends, which I accepted, hoping my heart would follow suit. We stayed close friends, but I noticed I'd become far too attached to him. I tend to get a bit anxious when we don't talk/see each other for a while, for example. I think this is most likely because I still have feelings for him (I wish I could just flip a switch and no longer feel love). I recently realized that once we graduate, we will most likely not see much of each other, if ever again, which fills me with dread. Clearly, I've become too emotionally attached. Therein lies the question: How can I emotionally distance myself from someone without ruining a friendship? In essence, how to make someone a preferred indifferent. The majority of answers I find online are to abandon the friendship and move on, but I value him as a person beyond a mere imagined romantic partner, or at least I hope I do. I am sorry this is a somewhat complicated problem dealing with attachment, love, friendship, loss, etc., but I suppose that is the human condition. 

Any advice or sources of wisdom for a struggling Stoic would be greatly appreciated.

I want to defend Karl Jaspers' critique of Stoicism.,"This is an old post, with an ignorant comment about ""the mind in itself is empty...""

Source: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/q35vsg/karl\_jaspers\_on\_stoicism/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/q35vsg/karl_jaspers_on_stoicism/)

As for the ""non-savoir"" or ""no-mind"", it is a pure experience (proposed by William James, Nishida Kitaro and Karl Jasper,...). In that experience, you and the object are one, you have no wrong thinking about that object, do not put evil feelings on that object, you even intuitively perceive that object. This is the feeling of Jesus, Buddha, Plotinus, Socrates, Confucius, Lao Tzu.

This experience often occurs while you work in the ""flow state"".

Karl Jaspers wants to say something the Stoics if they still shape their thinking according to Stoic theories. Then they will not have absolute freedom.

But, Seneca and Marcus also have a sense of pure experience. Because Seneca used his inner self to observe himself and discovered that he was greedy for power when others took the seat reserved for high-ranking people. Or like Marcus Aurelius who always discovered greed when eating, and then used negative thinking to reduce that desire.

In short, what Karl Jaspers wanted the Stoics to do is that ""if you have access to no mind-non savoir (nirvāṇa of buddhism), then never shape your thinking within the framework of Stoic again.

My view on life,"If one could live eternally, their life would lost meaning, death gives meaning to life. So I think this reincarnation cycle is designed by the eternal being so that it can live meaningful lives limitlessly, and we are the incarnation of that eternal being. I also think that not only human but all living beings are the incarnation/avatar of that eternal being, as it’ll give it every possible way to experience life. There is a proverb in my culture, saying that hell and heaven are not in another universe/afterlife, but we are actually living in hell and heaven now, in the present, our life become hellish by the wrongdoings of others and it feels heaven by the love of others. As we all are the incarnation of the same being, so no karma will go unnoticed, unpunished or unrewarded, any wrongdoing we do to other beings is only wrongdoing toward us, as we are the same being, only in a different form, the same goes for the kindness, empathy, love and care we show to other beings are just received by us consequently.

I've been stuck in a rut for so long. Help.,"It all started back in July last year when I got Long Covid conditions. I got depressed and unmotivated and soon after I fell into what I now call a rut. It was all gradual but basically my life currently feels like a repetitive cycle.
I wake up, pray, exercise a bit and bath, and start my day. But I have no plan cause in the middle of that I'm caught up with my phone (this is a huge problem for it), 
I want to pray the rosary but I feel like it can get too long (long story short, on average, nowadays, it takes me around 1 hour and 50 minutes to complete 5 mysteries) so I basically hold off praying it (I break up the decades on schooldays but sometimes don't finish it) 
I want to do tasks like studying (it's literally exam week and I studied little) because when I haven't prayed the Rosary, It feels like I did not complete a task and so it hurts going back and forth. 
When I do pray, my head already feels sick beforehand and I feel loud beats, my eyes hurt too.
My focus has been going up and down and Everytime I do the good habits, I fall back again. I'm hardly consistent. Even if I tried to take it slow and build up, I just can't seem to do so.

I feel horrible but at the same time I'm giving my best in being joyful and positive. I'm not depressed or anxious either.

I feel horrible too because I haven't made any progress in life. My spiritual life has beeing going up and down but one thing is that I've sticked with God and clinged to him.

I feel horrible because I don't see any progress in my goals, spiritually, physically and even on my career.

I want to be an artist to glorify God but currently, I have zero skills on any instrument (can't afford classes currently) and I have nothing to produce music with. I also want to make a fashion brand but that's another thing. 

My grades seem all over the place and over the past here, I've been wanting to switch electives for my classes.

I've been inconsistent in working out too. I go to the gym here and there mostly because I only use e-hailing as a means of transportation and I can't afford monthly membership.  cut out sugar and seed oils from my diet. I thank God that my body still feels good but it hasn't seemed to progress much.

I could go on and on but let me say, I'm still grateful for everything and thank God I can still type this out.

I just don't feel productive, consistent and truly acting on my goals. I get easily distracted and my focus  all over the place.im broke so I can't afford much for my goals of music and artistry.
I feel like I'm letting God down,  just has given me everything I need and I'm not taking action in building his Kingdom.

Whats a stoics take on crisis aid?,"I am new to stoicism. Please be kind.
What is a stoics take on providing help to a stranger at a time of their personal crisis? This is from a philosophical standpoint.
Think of this way. It is our ability to deal with difficulties that make us more able. Yet at the same time there are difficulties which are meaninglessly harsh like an ongoing civil war. Or a bad debt in family due to someone's crippling illness. Yes, such difficulties often create diamonds. But more often than not, they break other equally valuable gemstones. Maybe a maths genius is not street smart enough to flourish in a civil war (even though he is not directly affected enough to deem life or death threat) or some great artist is not a financial genius. Does it make sense to have NGOs who support people in crisis, not just in food, supplies and monetary during a crisis but also skill based. Some NGO which helps solve crippling problems which arise out of a complex daily life. Like a religious institution like a church or religious clergy, but without the encroachment on personal decisions or moral high ground or ritualism. (I am not against personal faith but rather granduer of any religion including mine)
How does an ideal version of that ngo like that affect a community in the long run? Is it good, is it bad? Does the community grow or become reliant? What are the risks of a non-ideal version of that NGO?

The Stoic advice is to try and educate people who are thinking or acting in a way that's against society. It's advised to walk away if this isn't possible and to perhaps try and help with any fallout of their behaviour.

So recently, if I've had an instant urge (propathesia) to downvote someones post or comment, I've examined that response more closely. I decided to try and understand why they think like this, and bring their attention to their thought process, and the ways they can change it to be more in line with Stoic thinking. I've done this with the intention to help, but it recently wasn't received well.

It makes more sense focus my energy on people who want to change, and who are looking for Stoic advice. But at the same time the people who could benefit most from thinking differently are those who might currently be more closed to it.",Stoicism,1686415428.0,t3_1464wfs,0.56,1
Stoic Music,"Music has always been a major, often the most, impactful influence/medium/inspiration to carry me through tough times.  Lately I’ve been going through an extremely challenging time emotionally, intellectually, and physically, and have discovered stoicism.  Turns out my older brother was already into it.  I have been amazed at how simple and TRUE the concepts land with my worldview, but also how they challenge my worldview in healthy ways.

This discovery has inspired me to revisit formative music from my adolescence such as Time for Living (see the song “Discount Brick”, please…life’s too short for defeat). There are some great folk ballads that ring true as well like “My Favorite Friends” by Hollow Trees and “Hard Road to Travel” by The Okee Dokee Brothers.

Need advice with a friend,"I have a friend who got with my abusive ex (they knew my experience) I told them that they can do what they want (they asked for my permission) but set a boundary asking them to not speak about their experience around me. They ended up having a bad experience and have been gossiping and badmouthing  that ex infront of me with my friends (we have the same friend group) in code language so I dont understand, they’ve called me crying before (breaking that boundary) and ive said no I don’t want to speak on this and today in our group chat they mentioned “im gonna text my ex” and another friend pointed out “omg (ME) is in the chat”.

"Going to an exam without studying, how to accept the reality?","This test is tomorrow, it's like A-levels and will determine which universities I can apply to. So, last year I had lost my dog just before the same god damn exam and thus messed up, luckily managed to graduate though. Took a gap year. My mental health started declining to the point I was planning my own death and didn't see a point in studying, I did not see a future nor knew I would even live to take them again. Then I told my therapist about the plans, my medication was changed and my friends accidentally got to know as well. Little by little I started getting better to the point I at least try to live a little longer. However, now guilt and shame is overtaking me, even if I understand I can't do anything about it anymore, but I don't know if I'll manage another gap year. But I will go there at least, I refuse to simply run away from problems even if my chance of getting the grade I need is practically zero point one, I'm generally bad at math. I'm worried my thoughts will come back if I yet again can't get into university, can't get a job and have to live another year in my abusive household, though my friend promised I can move there if things get bad.

Is stoicism practical for current human beings?,"Stoicism is a philosophy for evolved humans, not for current humans. For some, my assertion might sound obvious; for others, maybe arrogant. But every now and then I learn of people that struggles to think or behave as a stoic but fails at the end. I think that the problem is that Reason (what Nature gives us and defines us as human) is a double edged sword: it gives good advice when we're not stressed or worried (reading uncle Seneca is a source of good advises); but on the other hand, when combined with our primitive instincts, Reason becomes our enemy.

It's surprising that animals (which don't possess reason and are driven by instincts) live a peaceful life as long as they're not in danger. However, in case of human beings, Reason gives instincts the power of time and space extrapolation. Reason tells the inner brain: ""hey, you're not hungry now, but tomorrow you can be"". And this is fatal because the loop Reason-instincts locks by itself. 

I think human beings are not evolved enough to implement stoicism as a way of life. Maybe in the future we are not partially driven by instincts anymore. So far the best thing we can do is to have people around (or this subreddit) that reminds us the stoic precepts in order to find a way that takes us out of the darkness we feel we live in from time to time.",Stoicism,1655408600.0,t3_vdu8zt,0.5,0
My mind is kinda in shambles. It's not the biggest of problems but it has caused me some annoyance.,"Ok so I would like to have a stoic perspective on this. 

I am a femboy and am only accepted I certain places (at least with my femininity). But those places are filled certain dangerous political ideologies or they tolerate those ideologies (I'm talking about really extremes of the spectrum here). I don't like those ideologies and I don't want to see them. But if I bring the issue up, I get shot down. And if I go to other spaces, I won't be accepted as a femboy or see stuff aren't really accepting of people like me. I don't want to conduct myself either with bigots or with extremists. I feel like I'm not really accepted anywhere.

And ofc I'm not accepted irl as I live in South Asia. What do I do in this situation? I'm really at a loss, maybe I'm forgetting something but idk where I can be a femboy and not face extremist apologetics or people that tolerate them at a regular rate.

Or maybe another way of looking at this: How do I uphold my morals without falling into the trap of sharing spaces with those ideologues?",Stoicism,1649255532.0,t3_txnisj,0.5,0
Friends Depth instead of breath!,"My philosophy when it comes to friend is to focus on depth rather than breath. In the modern world, people have hundreds of friends, but it's very surface level and superficial I find. I focus on only having a handful of **really** good friend where I invest all my time and energy. For the rest of the people I know, I give them my Facebook where I only sign in once every 3-6months.

I just don't think that humans have adapted to knowing dozens of thousands of people and making friends with thousands of them. Your time is finite, so you should only really nurture the relationships that have value (to you and the other person; in a reciprocal manner). If you wanted to invest all your time maintaining 100s of relationships, it would probably end up looking like chatting on messenger for 30min a week while they're distracted with something else. 

Instead, I have decided to only focus on a few dozen friends with depth. I could call any of them and we could organize a hiking trip, camping, skiing, a trip to Japan. Or even, I can be sure they'll be there for me if I need help etc.

What about people who need to be taught a lesson?,"I've had two uncomfortable encounters that have had me thinking all day about how one should deal with some people... The first one is ridiculous, I passed by a guy, on the sidewalk (I'm roller skating), he moves oddly, looks off, throws some paper towel on the floor, just bad vibe. As I pass by him he yells at me asking what I want and why I'm looking at him wrong. I kept going. Later on, commuting to work by bike, some buy in a van decided to overtake me even though he didn't have enough room for it because I wasn't going fast enough for his taste. The fact that I was going as fast as the car in front of me and likely to overtake it at the next red light didn't deter him. His side mirror almost hit me.

And it just gets me thinking... Am I making the world a better place if I let these people to get their way, be reckless with others' lives, and just be bullies ? On the other hand, am I doing well if I get myself into situations that will turn up bad ? The first guy couldn't have been reasoned with, he just looked so angry for no reason, if I had wanted to confront him it would have been for a fight... The second guy in the car, I could have smashed his window, he might have gotten out of the car, could have run me over after that, I don't know...

But at the same time I figure if that van guy had done the same to my wife, who's not as comfortable as I am on a bike, she could have tripped, get run over... The other guy, had I not been a guy, somewhat in shape, might have decided to just attack straight away...

A part of me feels like twice today I missed the opportunity to teach some people that they can't just do the shit they want and that if neither justice nor karma nor something spiritual like that will force them to be good people, then other people will...

It just sounds like I want to fight everyone which really isn't my personality at all, but these kinds of incivilities just start to turn into things I want to be a solution for, kind of like global warming in a way...

Does being stoic make you appear more strong and powerful? If so how?,I read somewhere that talking slower and appearing less in a rush gives off a confident vibe.

Was I stoic before I even knew about it?,"In my early teenage I was a very anxious and negative version of myself... I cared a lot about having a successful life, pleasing others and so on. 

But when I became 16, I started to think about something I had never been aware of, death. I lived my life without worrying about it, because it had always looked so distant, but then I had become 16, and I realize how fast time passes... It was like yesterday when I was 8 years old and wondered how would be life when I become 15?? And now I am already 17, so I won't even realize when I become 30, 60 and until the arrival of my final day (which may be be tomorrow), so death become something that looked far, but very close at the same time, and sometimes I even panic about death. 

This made me lose my anxiety, I started to think ""well, I will be dead, so why should I worry about what others think or how successful I am going to be? Just live life!"" And I felt very amazing, I would appreciate things that I had never realized how relaxing and joyful they are, going for a walk, beholding in a park and so on, not caring about anything, since the future is uncertain, and I can't control this fact. 

But after my 16s, I started to lose these awarenesses, and I don't have any clues of why... I am way better than before (I am not extremely negative and anxious like before) but I can still get a little anxious and sometimes care about what others think (which limits happiness imo).

Then, I saw stuff about stoicism, and I identified a lot to it (when I was around my 15/16 years. I would like to be that person again. But it feels that I am into some kind of mindset... Mindset that makes me unaware that one day I won't enjoy this marvelous thing called life again, and maybe never ever.

He could have also tried to engineer a peaceful succession to another candidate altogether. Although these aren't perfect solutions, they do seem less sentimental.

"Really, do you live as if you will die tomorrow?","I see myself as a spiritual being having a human experience. That is a misquote I stole but it seems accurate. I also read something about a bomb defuser saying they do not feel stressed because they either do it right or its not their problem anymore. I carry this as a staple and it has benefited me a lot I accept the consequences or all my actions and my own mortality.

I've self harmed twice. The first was in Prague someone ridiculously attractive and as crazy as me had a smoking fetish. 3 hours of craziness left I had 21 cigarette burns on my arm. A few days ago I carved a different woman's initial on my thigh. I did it because she sees it as a sign of love and while I think love has no price, fuck it right? She would love me without me doing it I know she would but the fact that it is free and I paid anyway, that's a reciprocation of what she means to me. I get no rush from any of this no thrill no fetish or kink it's more that, I see myself as a bottle of water. No one cares about the plastic they care about the water. I am a sealed container and I know that while cutting is a reflection of poor mental state for me this is literally just that I live as if I will die because I will! It also had no influence on my mental state besides a bit of shame and embarrassment considering future explanations. Imagine me giving this speech to a one night stand lmao. If you fell over and scarred your knee you wouldn't feel bad about falling would you? No stigma, you just fell. I can do the same thing here. I am not cutting to vent pain or struggling to handle existence it was just... fuck it, it doesn't affect me but it will affect someone I love, positively. Why not? It is a purely pragmatic approach.

I believe expectations depict 80&#37; of the outcome of life anyway so i like to live as in the moment as possible. I am backpacking Europe for a month on my own soon as I did last year and with nothing but a small bag and a one way ticket, no accommodation no plans of countries or people to be with. Last time I did this I lost my phone and wallet 2 days in. The last day of that trip I woke up realized damn I booked the flight for today instead of tomorrow, had to book the last available night bus from Berlin to Amsterdam and fly home. Since I had no phone I had no way of knowing where the bus stop was besides a paper map I had to download, and even to this day I have no which way is North East South or West. I arrived at the bust stop 30 minutes late to find the bus had been delayed an hour. Now while I can assure you, the time trying to find that bus stop was as stressed as I am physically capable of feeling, I survived, and I made it through knowing that I have found the rim of the spectrum of emotion, been there and returned unscathed. Had I missed the bus, i would have deserved to from my actions and poor planning. And been still, unscathed.

I am forever unscathed, and that trip was the best time of my life by FAR.

I consider myself sane in a world full of crazy people and I am typing this to what I consider the sanest community I have found. I know I will be considered unorthodox or crazy or whatever and I consider myself how stable I really am occasionally but in general I keep on top of my own mental health without therapy or medication or external forces and I think regardless of how reckless I treat life that is the cornerstone of stoicism.  I used to do motorracing when I lived off of the bank of Daddy and that taught me that if you don't crash or spin out occasionally you are not even close to testing the boundaries. If I can be 90 and have had no close calls no near misses no lucky chances, no physically signs of wear and tear, then I've not lived. Not to my potential. I have played life safe and safety, comfort, security, they are not stoicism, they are hiding from the times when stoicism can keep you moving forward. Discuss :P

Toxic School Environment,"How do I apply stoicism in a situation I can't really opt out of, unlike a detrimental friendship? I'm in my junior year of high school and I find that a number of my classes are legitimate wastes of time, and often stressful, but not because of the actual subjects being ""taught"". As an example, the teacher of my U.S. history class is constantly picking petty verbal exchanges between the the two smart-asses constantly interrupting with their political opinions and jokes. She also antagonizes the class whenever we don't give her the proper ""energy"" she desperately craves in the morning (as a side note, all the classes I have problems with happen to be led by females who can't control the situation or their emotions, and that's another major stress factor).

The only parts of stoicism I can agree with.,"How I agree:

I agree that people make their pain worse by interpreting it as bad. If you just did not think about the pain in any form, then the pain would hurt less. If you find virtue in the endurance of pain, then pain will hurt less. If you are creative and can find the positive in any situation, including pain, than pain will hurt less.

I agree that you should not expect anything other than hardship and make the most out of whatever you are stuck with. You should accept what is not in your control and not base your happiness on what is not in your control. All we can control is our ability to chose. To chose how we judge the pain and chose our attitude in any given situation. You should base your happiness on what is in your control. We can only control our virtue and therefore must teach ourselves to base our happiness and peace on our virtue. We must not strive to to avoid or acquire but to be free of the need to avoid or acquire. This is the path to peace.

How I differ:

Some things are worth emotionally investing in because the growth as a person outweighs the inevitable pain from loss. Such as family, hiking, reading, friends, and lovers. As long as you are aware that those things are impermanent and have learned to accept that, than the pain will hurt less when they do leave your life. It is about preparing yourself for pain in order to minimize it's impact on you. being mindful of your thought also contributes to minimize your pain.

Our thoughts do have a profound effect on the world we create for ourselves. The hardware of the mind fallows the lead of the conscious mind. The unconscious and subconscious minds do a lot of work at the command of the conscious mind. For the most part, our brain can create what what we teach it to create. Our thoughts have a profound impact on our mind. we must become masters of our thoughts to find peace.",Stoicism,1492018600.0,t3_64zo7h,0.58,2

"Misunderstanding about ""Neo""-Stoicism","It has become a kind of fashion to talk about ""Neo""-Stoicism. In order to discuss the matter properly we need a definition of this term. If we go back to Justus Lipsius we'll find no significant contribution to the system so we can define it as something new besides the fact that he tried like a biased Christian of the time to fit the system to his religion. But this also is nothing new as many of the Church fathers attempted at least partially the same thing in the 3-6 centuries. Lipsius himself was not thoroughly acquainted with Stoicism, particularly the Physics so it is at least strange to talk about ""Neo"" just because it happned 12 centuries later. 

If we follow thic logic we should talk about ""Neo""-chemistry or ""Neo""-physics which is likewise absurd. Same with Stoicism. All the prefixes like ""neo"", ""ultra"", ""modern"" are based on a profound lack of knowledge (and even worse: half-knowledge) about the system and/or a desire for fame.


Stoicism as the science of the whole of life which offers a logical and encompassing explanation of the world is a synopsis of millenia old wisdom and, at least for my understanding, comparing it to Egyptian, Indian, Chinese and Western philosophical movements remains unsurpassed in its cohesiveness and explanatory force.

I feel like I raped my GF early on in our relationship. Where do I go from here?,"Long story short, When me (24m) and my gf (26f) started dating a few months ago, the first time we had sex, after first starting with a condom, I asked if she’d want to have sex without a condom. She asked me if had done an STD test recently. I said I did one a few months prior and it came back negative.

Then she asked me if I had had unprotected sex after that test. I told her no. That was a lie. I did. I slept with a girl a few times after doing the test and before meeting my now-girlfriend. 

When I told her no I didn’t think it was a big deal. I tested negative and had only slept with one person after that who I trust, so to me it seemed like it wasn’t a big deal to just say I hadn’t slept with anyone after the test.

A few weeks ago I read there’s such a thing as “rape by deception” ie lying or hiding information which makes consent invalid. Suddenly I realized that she probably wouldn’t have consented to sex without the condom if I told her the truth. Ever since that realization a few weeks ago I haven’t been able to sleep, I can’t think of anything else literally and I feel like a monster. I can’t look my gf in the eyes anymore. Where do I go from here? To start, yes I have done another STD test which also came back negative so it’s not like I gave her anything and we’re safe, but I have no clue how to deal with this guilt.

"I do not recommend ""How to be a Stoic"" by Massimo Pigliucci","When I started this book, I expected a philosophical manual on Stoicism, at the end of a most underwhelming read however, what was delivered was a poorly written and thinly disguised self-help book.

A Question to Non-Male Stoics: Do Male Pronouns Annoy You?,"I’m a male and am happy with whatever pronouns are in the text, as I’m there to learn. But, being in the majority, my opinion is naturally biased.  

When you read quotes such as: 

“Man conquers the world by conquering himself.” ― Zeno of Citium

Do you interpret ‘man’ as meaning ‘human’ or male?

And what would you advise for modern writing? To use female and male pronouns interchangeably, as many authors do? 

The rise of transgender pronouns could quickly make even modern texts seem dated. Third-person pronouns can’t be included in writing in place of first unless you wish to confuse the reader.

For example: They conquers the world by conquering themself - makes no sense. 

As a writer, I find knowing the correct approach tricky, especially for future proofing my writing. I have no wish to alienate people, especially from philosophy that’s historically used only male pronouns. 

I’m asking in this sub, as I want to ask readers, not English grammar educators, as it doesn’t matter what’s ‘right,’ but what people feel comfortable with. Otherwise, they’ll just avoid the writing altogether.

Criticism of Stoicism,">The arguments against Stoicism that are effective for me, are that the Stoic virtues of rationality, and prudence about their physical existence, fail to capture the values that matter more in this life.

>Stoic rationality, and their resistance to emotions, gets in the way of their experiencing and benefiting from Love, Joy, and enthusiasm. If one holds by a Love Virtue ethic, this makes stoicism a harmful ideology. Stoics tend instead to hold by either a Truth virtue ethic, or by a utilitarian consequentialism, in which they presume that life is material.

>The physicalism that is intrinsic to stoicism makes their valuation of integrity over mere survival hard to justify. Will a stoic sell out refugees to a Nz search party? Will a stoic perform a negative rational cost-benefit analysis of your low value to him while you are asleep while you two are lost in a lifeboat? Virtues, morality, and integrity, presuppose the reality of non-physical values. And while values and integrity were generally held to by stoics in practice, the theory to justify this choice appears to be in conflict with a core assumption of the philosophy.

Objection To The Negative Visualization Principle in Stoicism,"Negative visualization is the flaw of stoic thought and practice. While I understand the idea it is flawed in the fact that a persons thoughts are energy. Our thoughts, particularly thoughts that are repeated and focused on will have a tendency to materialize through our subconscious.

One may argue that this visualization negative or otherwise is inevitable so you are only preparing yourself. I disagree with this argument because life is an agreement between that which we can control and can't control. With that being as it is, we can control our thoughts, and it is counterproductive to the aims of a good life to seed negative thoughts. Furthermore, for people who suffer from trauma and anxiety this technique will definitely create an unwanted result.

So what is the alternative?

The Path of Most Resistance

I submit that The Path of Most Resistance is the way to build up the character ""skill"" that negative visualization aspires to develop.

The path of most resistance is the idea that when faced with a choice in life, instead of always looking for the easy way to your desired goal or destination choose the one with the most foreseeable resistance.

Why do this and why does it work?

Mans only real power in life is his choice. When a man chooses to the path of most resistance he is ACCEPTING by choice the unknown experiences of resistance. This is important because at the core of difficult experiences lies the fundamental struggle of acceptance of what is or resisting what is. 

Sitting around thinking about what you don't want will not prepare you, choosing to accept that which you already know is not pleasant will prepare you to deal with real life situations. 

The ensuing experiences from making such a bold choice will prepare and reveal yourself to you on many levels. The rewards and preparation that one derives from this way pays exponentially more dividends than seeding negative thoughts and energy into your universe and beyond.

"Hell, Camus, and the Ancient Stoics","I have a thought experiment and a question for y'all. 

**(The setup)**

Imagine that on the Day of Judgement, God, the Christian god, banishes the ancient Stoics to Hell. 

There are many Christian views on Hell, but let's suppose this Hell is an *inescapable*, *eternal* stream of *torment*. 

I know there are many Christians on this sub. Out of respect for their faith, let's not argue but simply suppose that the Ancient Stoics come to the conclusion that the Christian God is unjustful and thus not worthy of worship. Their claim is that an inescapable, eternal stream of torment is unjustifiable and inappropriate for punishment for whatever ""sins"" they committed in their finite lifetimes. If humans can forgive their persuctors, they reason, then surely the ""all loving"" Christian God can forgive. And if humans have the instinct to correct, rather than just punish, bad behavior , surely the ""all loving"" Christian God would eventual seize the torment so that people could reintegrate back into a relationship with God. 

**(The question)**

What attitude would the Ancient Stoics take in Hell? How would they handle themselves in Hell?

To be clear, this is just speculation. I speculate the Stoics would forgive the Christian God. I would imagine them like Camus said of Sisyphus:  *One must imagine Sisyphus happy*

And I would even imagine Epictutus whispering to himself:

> To incarceration. Do I have to complain about it? To exile.

Secret phrases or references,"Many groups have secret signs, handshakes, insignia or phrases used to warn, acknowledge or indicate to other members of the group that they are also in said group when in public. I’m thinking mainly of fraternities and secret societies. Sometimes these phrases could mean as simple as “good job” but without saying the specific words.  

Did the ancient stoics have any secret phrases whereby they could indicate to others they are practicing stoics or did they have a “nickname” for fellow stoic students?

How should a stoic think about his/her own mental health struggles?,"Been going through a mental health crisis. And that means a lot of emotions, etc. Honestly I think emotions are an important part of cognition and we need to experience emotions in order to process trauma, etc.

But how should a stoic view those emotions? It may not be healthy to reject them... some emotions are the vehicle for realization and recognition of repressed truth. Like feeling anger at an abuser, that anger is communicating to our deep subconscious and validating the pain. It would not be healthy to not assent to that emotion, and invalidate your pain by being indifferent.

Is it possible that we need to put stoicism on the shelf sometimes? Like it is an operating system, but sometimes we need to work in the bios to fix an underlying problem, if that makes sense.",Stoicism,1692503432.0,t3_15w0me0,0.45,0

Help me feel better about rehoming pet rabbit.,"Had a rabbit for 7 days. Had to rehome him 5 days ago.

While owning the rabbit: I was not coping well with the change. I even called the s*icide hotline because I was having mental breakdown in the middle of the week. I started smashing things in my room and i would hide upstairs so I can avoid the rabbit. I would hate evenings spent downstairs with my family because the rabbit was there. I would cry in the shower and scheme of ways to get rid of it. My family loved him but I communicated to them that I was having panic attacks and mental breakdowns. They were very upset with me and blamed my mental illness but understood and now the rabbit is gone back to his foster home.

Now: i feel guilt. Like maybe I could have given him more time. Maybe my family would have been happier with him around. He was really cute. But there was a chance I never would have gotten used to it and would have hated being home. I think about the time and remind myself how bad I was feeling and how I wanted to die. The house feels empty and lonely again. But at least I’m able to walk around without feeling panic

I can’t get any pet now after this experience so there is nothing I can do. I just need to make peace with it. How do i start? I will try to be a pet owner again after a few years.",Stoicism,1684438894.0,t3_13l8p6e,0.58,2

Is there a stoic guide that thoroughly addresses every aspect of how to be patient,"That doing what's right sometimes requires patience Meditations 4:3

King Bumi: Listen to me Aang, there are options in fighting called Jing. It's a choice of how you direct you're energy

Aang: I know, there's positive Jing when you're attacking and negative Jing when you're retreating.

King Bumi: And neutral Jing, when you do nothing. Neutral Jing is the key to earth bending. It involves listening and waiting for the right moment to strike. You're teacher will be someone who listens and wait.

I wonder, what if the ""right moment to strike"" never comes. At what point do you stop waiting. I have refallen for a former girlfriend(dealing with childhood issues in therapy brought me to the conclusion that  there was unfinished business with her). It's one sided unrequited love and being a highly sensitive person, I am probably expressing my affection in a demanding, intense and unrealistic way. Ave said what I needed to say and am now waiting patiently for her to return my affection. 

If she does, I'll celebrate it, but what if she doesn't, what if she takes too long and love being whimsical I have already moved on. What would've been the point of excersing patience. Isn't patience a form of hoping that events out of control will go our way?

""APOLLONIUS His patience in teaching. And to have seen someone who clearly viewed his expertise and ability as a teacher as the humblest of virtues."" _Meditations. 
I didn't know how to be patient when I teaching  programming to some University students for 4 years. I just didn't believe I was smarter than any of them, and yet I had taught myself programming and most of them struggled with the most basic things. How was supposed to approach it if some really enthusiastic students felt I was going too slow,  and some disinterested ones thought I was going too fast. Everyone has different learning needs, but how was supposed to be patient with students who told me they didn't want to be there but were being forced. And for how long was I supposed to be patient. And wouldn't that patience just have been a waste of time.

Does stoicism make unmotivated and less disciplined people?,"
 Does the stoic method of expecting the worst, telling yourself the worst case scenario will happen continuously, make you much less motivated to reach for high goals? 

I feel like I suffer from this, actually “convincing” myself the worst possible outcome will happen makes me comfortable in mediocrity, I feel like. 

If I try and reach for the limit the chances are very large that the worst scenario is realized, partially because the chances of succeeding are -objectively- small. Knowing that ànd also rubbing it in by using the stoic method mentioned above (making the chances -subjectively- small too), leads to low-achieving attitudes, does it not?

why would a stoic get married?,"What purpose does it serve ? 

Is it to have and raise kids in a stable environment?  If so why is having kids preferred? 
Few people not having kids is not going to significantly affect the society. 

Or is marriage preffered as human beings desire love and companionship? If that's the case, a lot of other things that human beings desire is discouraged ( example, casual sex ). 

I can't find a good answer for how getting married and having kids is helpful for the society and choosing to get married for the sake of fullfilling the desire to be loved and to have a companion seems selfish to me. 

Infact, if a person avoids marriage, he can save a lot of time and money to do good. 

But actually, i have a strong desire to get married and have kids, i just don't know if desire is a good enough reason to get married. 

But if i do get married( I'm single currently) and have kids, there's a chance that the marriage might end in divorce, hurting the kids. 

Considering this, it seems like having kids is the morally inferior choice to make as the only reason to choose to have kids is my desire to have kids.

Can't shake the feeling my self worth isn't based on what kind of partner I can attract.,"Hey friends,

I'm having a pretty bad time and its worse because I'm literally in the best position in my life I have ever been in. I'm trying to remember that its just myself making me feel like this but I'm still just down in the dumps.

A few months ago I posted about using the facet of stoicism of enjoying the process and not end result to have the courage to tell a girl I have feelings for her.

After reflecting on that I will admit I was wrong to do that. Both using her as my object to complete a goal and also being overly forward in the very initial phases of the interaction were not virtuous or attractive.

Since then I have learned a lot more about dating and been having better results than getting straight shut down, and even got a few hookups and girls interested in me.

However, after a few months in the dating market I feel pretty weak and beat up mentally.

My biggest concern is why I am in good shape, taking care of myself, good financially, handsome, and an insightful human being, and doing overall great in life, And then the only women that really give me a chance are women who I feel have not worked on themselves as much as I have.

I've been trying to be open minded and giving girls I wouldn't normally a chance.

I enjoy rock climbing and doing uphill sprints to stay in shape, but why is it that I am only getting opportunity to be with a woman who is 50-100lbs overweight and complaining about walking up a hill.

It sucks because when they text me I feel like barfing. Its unfair to them too because they should be with someone who is excited to hear from them. The girl from the post a few months ago totally captivated me just by her presence.

I'm really fucked up about this. And its even more difficult because when I complain about not being able to find a girl who is as good of shape as me and is also fun, then someone else chimes in and says ""oh yea, well my dad just died from corona and because i was grieving so much i lost my job and now i'm about to be homeless"" Its like ok sure yea my problems aren't even problems compared to your problems.

I just look at my friends and they have girlfriends who are hot and cool and I'm having a tough time getting a girl who is either and not attaching the type of girl I can get to my self worth as a human being.

Like yea I've accomplished all this stuff and have great qualities, but then why can I only get single moms who no one wants? What do those guys with good looking girls have why am I lesser than them is what I am thinking.

I'm still working out and eating right and I am not using drugs to cope. I'm going to go skateboarding after this post and try to use the feeling of being close to death to stop myself from worrying about this shit.",Stoicism,1630359712.0,t3_perw7w,0.38,0
Is Stoicism a gateway to Madness?,"By Madness, I mean doing things that should normally be impossible, or maybe suicidal. Not the madness which refers to the dark side of men, e.g. destruction of reason, but the madness of utterly disregarding oneself to achieve one's goal.

I know such extremes usually don't occur in our modern life, but suppose a situation requires you to forfeit your life, a Stoic would calmly and rationally accept it. Normal people will see this as madness, as something utterly unusual, after all, isn't living the most important of all? But a Stoic does not see this as madness but just what he ought to do, no different than cleaning one's yard.

So that returns me back to my question. Stoicism can convince you of what you ought to do and in the process, can Stoicism cause you to act in ways that people would otherwise label as ""Insane""?

I know for certain that Seneca and Socrates' willingness to calmly drink the poison of eternal slumber would be seen by normal people as insane.

Seneca and Socrates probably didn't think of what they did as insane but just, it simply is. What other feats would normal people perceive as the acts of a madman but to a stoic, just another task?

Lastly, I asked this question because in the same way that an evil person does not see himself as evil, so is a madman. He probably don't think he's insane.",Stoicism,1609501841.0,t3_koa3dn,0.58,2
Ex-Stoic with some ideas,"Hi everyone. I used to be a huge believer in stoicism, I now have some reservations. Wondering what everyone thinks about it. The things that caused me to question it were the following:

1) I never understood the basis for the belief that nature is ruled by the logos. I think that Stoicism sees what is rational from a Stoic viewpoint and then retroactively applies that to nature.

2) If nature matches their description and operates according to the logos, then how could someone not act in accordance with that nature? And if someone could successfully defy nature, why doesn’t it call into question the desirability of submitting to that pre-ordained order?

3) I think the psychological viewpoint that one’s mind is totally their domain is questionable, which threatens  the viability of the prescriptions of Stoicism.

The Freedom to Not Wear Masks,"As I see more and more people refuse to wear masks in the name of freedom, I am reminded of this chapter of The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran.  What do you think of the passage?

&#x200B;

At the city gate and by your fireside I have seen you prostrate yourself and worship your own freedom,

Even as slaves humble themselves before a tyrant and praise him though he slays them.

Ay, in the grove of the temple and in the shadow of the citadel I have seen the freest among you wear their freedom as a yoke and a handcuff.

And my heart bled within me; for you can only be free when even the desire of seeking freedom becomes a harness to you, and when you cease to speak of freedom as a goal and a fulfillment.

You shall be free indeed when your days are not without a care nor your nights without a want and a grief,

But rather when these things girdle your life and yet you rise above them naked and unbound.

And how shall you rise beyond your days and nights unless you break the chains which you at the dawn of your understanding have fastened around your noon hour?

In truth that which you call freedom is the strongest of these chains, though its links glitter in the sun and dazzle your eyes.

And what is it but fragments of your own self you would discard that you may become free?

If it is an unjust law you would abolish, that law was written with your own hand upon your own forehead.

You cannot erase it by burning your law books nor by washing the foreheads of your judges, though you pour the sea upon them.

And if it is a despot you would dethrone, see first that his throne erected within you is destroyed.

For how can a tyrant rule the free and the proud, but for a tyranny in their own freedom and a shame in their own pride?

And if it is a care you would cast off, that care has been chosen by you rather than imposed upon you.

And if it is a fear you would dispel, the seat of that fear is in your heart and not in the hand of the feared.

Verily all things move within your being in constant half embrace, the desired and the dreaded, the repugnant and the cherished, the pursued and that which you would escape.

These things move within you as lights and shadows in pairs that cling.

And when the shadow fades and is no more, the light that lingers becomes a shadow to another light.

And thus your freedom when it loses its fetters becomes itself the fetter of a greater freedom.",Stoicism,1590158512.0,t3_goklfq,0.42,0

Respectful Disagreement with Aurelius,"I value the words of most stoic philosophers.  But I respectfully disagree with Aurelius on something: he said to discipline your thought life.  I don't think we can control our thoughts or that we should try to.

I use the intrusive thoughts as a premeditatio malorum/negative visualization throughout the day.  I don't agree that we should waste 20 minutes in the morning doing it because how can we predict what will actually happen i.e. someone cutting us off in traffic or more importantly, what would actually be threatening?

I think our brain is our best frenemy and knows what actually scares us.  So it will throw those scary things at us so we can problem solve and get our dopamine.  Mine is social rehearsal (jouska?).

My solution to the conflicts most of us face (that the brain brings up) is to \*show\* kindness and virtue through actions rather than words.  I also look at people's actions instead of their words.  In life, I have become a person of few words, but a much nicer person who cares about people.  ",Stoicism,1549593662.0,t3_aobwt6,0.55,1
If and when you have anxieties about your life…,"...Pray fervently to the Lord from your heart in this way:  *“I place my fate in Thy hands, O my Saviour. In the way that Thou knowest, arrange my life as is best. From now on I cut off every care about myself, having but one care, to do what is pleasing before Thee (Here,God as Nature).”* 

This is basically *Amor Fati.*

Speak to God in this way, and by doing so you will already have placed yourself completely in His (Fate) hands, not being concerned about anything, but calmly accepting every sort of situation, pleasant or unpleasant, as being *arranged* (determinism) for you purposely by God (Fate). 

Your only concern should be to act according to (Nature) God’s commandments in everything. This is all that is required of you.

Marcus Aurelius is qualitatively inferior to Epictetus and Seneca,"I have read everything by Aurelius, Epictetus, Senca and Rufus.

Marcus Aurelius just feels dull. He does not write to enlighten or entertain. He adds nothing that is not better put forth in Epictetus or Seneca.

Seems to me he is appreciated because he was a great emperor, not because his book is enlightening. The value of Aurelius rather just is as the diary of a practitioner.

6th grade stoicism,"As a boy in the sixth grade who is very much a realist, and a devout stoic, I find my fellow students unable to truly grasp the idea of stoicism and my logical and philosophical way of thinking.

Simplistic people, any advice?",Stoicism,1484105353.0,t3_5n9s7q,0.53,1
All Stoics are Closeted Epicureans,"That isn't an insult, by the way. In fact, when it comes to detachment, externals, and the approach to death, there isn't much daylight between stoics and epicureans. Epicurus extolled simple pleasures, and argued against ambition, riches, indulgent sex, etc. 

Epicureans view pleasure as moral, and pain as immoral. Therefore, to live a good life, you should live a happy or pleasurable life. And whether you realize it or not, *so do you.*

In the parlance of stoicism, vice would be short term pleasure that ultimately leads to pain.  Virtue on the other hand, is supposed to lead to a good life, by doing good. But stoics believed that doing good should be done for its own sake, and shouldn't be used to gain happiness. And that's where they're wrong. 

For no stoic can do good without expecting some type of gratification. Even the most extreme forms of self-sacrifice come with a measure of gratification, or pleasure, as the epicureans would say. The stoics point to Socrates's suicide as the stoic ideal; yet, the manner of his suicide offered Socrates a measure of gratification before his heart stopped ultimately beating. Even selflessness is ultimately a paradox, as you earn the gratification of being selfless. Therefore, even the most hardcore stoics are epicureans at heart. They want pleasure, not pain.",Stoicism,1674527116.0,t3_10juqo8,0.63,9

"The more I learn about stoicism, the more I think it is not for me","Stoicism seems like a ideology for loners, influencers, and leaders who rarely make strong connections with others. For its time, it seemed like a astounding breakthrough due to the lack of accountability, mental, and psychological help. People were looking for a way to survive and blocking out internal issues getting in that way seemed like the best bet.

However, I live a life where I simply cannot block out others. I must socialize with people. To simply brush things off has never been part of my personality. I also need to know when bad things happen, there must be some accountability rather than the ""stuff happens and move on"" mindset stoics are so bent on.

blackpill and stoicism,"Hi. I have learned about stoicism from the blackpill community. 

So for a brief idea about what blackpill is, that personality wont help you get women, and women are hypergamous so being average in todays promiscuous society isnt enough. So if you dont have good genetics, it is over for you. However i am not bothered by trivial incel stuff like this. But what bothers me is the wider and more broad view of what the black pill is about. It is said that by face value,  you will be judged by people and rise to great heights or remain in the depths. The black pill community showed some evidences of most successful men today (although anecdotal).and a lot of the were good looking. 

So my question to fellow stoics is (as stoicism ponders about value of human beings), are we as humans losing any value beyond our primal instincts?  Surely,  we wouldnt have come such a long way in society if only the physically superior were seen as leaders.(lets be honest tho, you cant rule people with muscles. It wont take more than 10 people rip a tyrant apart. Trust me on this,  i am a considerably large guy and used to bully others in high school and often got violent pushbacks for bullying others, people can be brutal and vicious against tyrants).

I think i am making this too long.

In short, i want to know 3 things 

1. what makes love between men and women? If a taken women finds a better conventionally attractive man and cheats on his current partner, will she be seen as responding to her innate nature, or should there be repurcussions again the ""animal instincts"" of human beings.

2.how would you suggest making ""shallow"" people(no disrespect) aware about some destructive sides of human nature.

3. I would like some comparative discussion between blackpill and stoicism. Preferably by someone who has very good idea about both of these subjects.",Stoicism,1656580257.0,t3_vo3z3f,0.41,0

Stoicism is pushing me to becoming vegan,"I used to be a huge meat eater, but as the title says Stoicism is pushing towards veganism.

I have been reading Stoic philosophy for a few years now and it has slowly changed my eating habits.

I began by eating less and eating healthy. Seeing food as something to nourish the body and not as something to desire for pleasure. I ate simple food and took my time to appreciate it (not eating while on my phone or distracted).

Then I started to consider the ethical factors and became vegetarian.

Empathy, Compassion, Benevolence, Rationality. How can we cultivate these virtues if our choices cause suffering?

I can no longer see how we can justify eating animal products when we can live healthy lives as vegans and do less damage to animals.

It seems as though eating animals comes down to a desire for pleasure. That pleasure comes at the expense of other living animals.

This is just my current opinion and it may change as I continue to learn. How has Stoicism affected how you eat?",Stoicism,1690604345.0,t3_15cims0,0.69,38
Would a stoic cry at a funeral?,"I had a discussion about Stoicism with a friend, his perception was that a stoic would not cry at a funeral since a stoic would most likely comfort their grieving family, whilst mine was that a stoic would since a stoic does not suppress natural emotions but those that are unnecessary and that grief is a natural emotion. 

Since then I've been diving deeper, death is a part of nature and out of one's control, so in that sense emotions shouldn't be ""controlling"" oneself. 10 out of Marcus Aurelius' 13 children died young, do you think he cried at their funeral?

I would say that I am a practising stoic and I have cried at the funerals I've attended and don't find anything wrong with grieving. I am however interested in how a true stoic would react to this. ",Stoicism,1692397550.0,t3_15uydlt,0.71,56

Ryan Holiday and his Stoicism can be seriously taken in account?,"Today I had a mind-blowing discovery. For some reason this guy: Ryan Holiday, that I remembered him from something in my past (Growth Hacking, Marketing, nothing I'm into anymore because I found it is an industry, the Marketing Industry, specially the digital marketing industry, completely apart from what the Virtue can be), this Ryan Holiday, is somehow, not only a top selling guru/expert advisor on Stoicism (The Obstacle in the way, obviously by his great marketing experience and the Daily Stoic books) something that we cannot control) but also keynote speaker in Stoicon 16? (something that we can actually control)

Is this completely serious?

Can anyone tell me, how this marketing massively manipulator machine can teach how the Virtue shall be achieved? Are we falling into the Scholars-no-example-just-advice-and-guidance section that from Socrates all philosophers tried to relief from society? 

Are we really introducing to the Stoic community, the typical self-book machine creator, apprentice from nothing less than the top self-book impostor, Robert Greene?

I had the curiosity, to checkout his conference (keynote speaker!!) and basically he reveals his 10 years reading experience with Stoicism. This guy basically is what Ancient Stoics were preventing, this guy is the massive example on what is meant not to be done about Stoicism.

And despite of this... he is called the keynote speaker of Stoicon 16? 

Watch this:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoDGgj_cfKE
This is the real spirit of Stoicism. Julia Annas is completely clear: Despite Epicureans had a big sign as first century PR (Public Relations) mechanism of how to achieve happiness with their ""method"", Stoics completely fall apart from this perspective. They did 0% PR. Stoicism is something that someone has to find by their own way.

If stoicism can't cure depression then what's the point?,"This is a genuine question. Lately I've seen a lot of posts of people coming here seeking guidance who are suffering from some form of depression. The common response I usually hear is to seek professional help and possibly medication(which I agree is probably a good thing to do).

But what I take from Stoicism as it concerns ethics is that all suffering is the result of irrational beliefs. But if the recommended treatment for depression is to seek psychological medical intervention then doesn't that make the point of stoicism kind of obsolete? If ethical stoicism concerns overcoming suffering via rational thinking, and the most rational option is to seek medical intervention then doesn't reason take a backseat?

My boss is absolutely insufferable to be around.,"I recently started a new job and the operation just involves me and my boss as workers, a two man show. We work on a boat so I live with him too. He is 63 years old and I seem to have underestimated how much being old really affects a persons capability of being rational. There are times when he panicks and freaks out about things that are completely trivial, and me being the way I am I kind of just let him do his thing and sometimes I ask him “why are you freaking out?” And he always has a sharp response. I don’t often take insults personally but when he says stupid BS I still get extremely annoyed. The difference in my attitude is probably noticeable, but I don’t really freak out in response to him freaking out as that would only send us down a whirlpool of bickering like a married couple. I usually just talk less. For example, he was cooking a couple slabs of salmon and he asked me if I knew where the olive oil is, I suggested three different spots it might be and he still couldn’t find it, but I didn’t physically help him find it.  Well he still found a way to blame me for the missing olive oil. He always tells me to “be careful not to break this or that” or “don’t lose this or that” and he thinks he has to hold my hand through absolutely everything because it’s my first time on a boat, but the reality is that it doesn’t seem like he knows much more about the job than I do. He has thirty years experience driving a boat, but the specific job we’re doing, not much. He feels the need to walk me through everything. I mean he thought I needed to be taught how to pull a cord on a generator to turn on the engine. What a joke. He makes me out to be an idiot he doesn’t trust me with anything and he treats me like a liability, an expense. On top of that, his word is worthless. Anything he says he is going to do, you can pretty much count on him to do the opposite. He is a lazy ass procrastinator which directly negatively effects our income. I only have to deal with him for another couple of months but how do I stoically arrange my thoughts to deal with this senile air head? I am trying to learn as much as I can from him but it’s hard to take him seriously when he’s worried about the most trivial BS in the world and not actually doing the job we came for… at this point I just want to finish the contract and find another job and never look back. But how do I think about this until then to ease my mind? Im tired of resenting him for being who he is. I have tried just being ok with him being a man child, but it’s still irritating me. Do I just continue to remind myself that it’s okay that he’s stupid I just have to pretend he has more to teach me, and maybe I’ll learn something? It’s so difficult to remember that even the dumbest people in the world can teach you something valuable about life. Which virtue am I lacking? Humility? Patience? Discipline?

Is stoicism anti-life?/ why do stoics do anything?,"I do not consider myself a stoic but I am familiar with the writings of Aurelius, Epictetus and the like. I study greaco-roman philosophy as a whole and stoicism is an essential part of it. I like stoicism and I look for ways to apply it practically in my life but I can't bring myself to commit to it.
Stoicism I find is too extreme. If stoics believe that the only thing that is good in life is pursuing virtue by living according to nature, and this is done by denying assent to impressions then why do they do anything? Isn't literally everything an impression? Why don't stoics just sit in bed and starve to death? Isn't food and hunger an impression? If you commit wholly to stoicism then what would motivate you to do anything?
I can't shake the feeling that stoicism is really a form of avoidance. You can keep yourself from feeling pain by pretending you don't care about life, but you also rob yourself of love, pleasure, passion and all the things that make life worth living. 
Aurelius says we should be indifferent to our family because they're mortal. But if my brother died right now I would be devastated, I would want to be devastated because I love him. Seneca says we should be indifferent to our bodies, but the body is a beautiful thing. You claim to follow nature but you disregard the body? One of the most complex and amazing works of art that nature has ever produced. If the body is worthless then why don't we just die right now?
Perhaps stoicism could be used as a survival mindset. Good for people who have no choice but to make massive sacrifices just to stay alive, but for everyday life it's too much.
I'm not bashing stoicism, although I do find it frustrating. I am open to the possibility that I am gravely mistaken over some area of the doctrine. If anyone could enlighten me it would be greatly appreciated.",Stoicism,1681155464.0,t3_12htjpv,0.41,0
Managing a crush in a Stoic way," So to contextualize a bit, a year ago I broke up with my boyfriend back then, although it had been a great relationship the break up was quite hurtful. Nevertheless, once the pain was over I really went through a glow-up season: I experienced an increase in self-esteem, confidence and was just incredibly well with my mind and body. It was at this point that I started learning about stoicism and overall, that period came with a great amount of personal growth. I learnt how to be with myself fully and really started enjoying my company and independence.   


As a consequence, I think I also started attracting some nice people into my life, one of whom was a very cute guy that had lots of traits that I identified were missing in my past relationship. Blinded by this fact (and due to some personal circumstances) we both rushed into a relationship. As you can imagine, this was not the best decision I could have taken. I was at a stage where I was enjoying being single and everything that came with a  relationship kind of collided with my priorities at that moment. As soon as I was aware of all of this, we broke up the short relationship. And that brings me to the present. My idea after the break-up was to give me that alone time I was craving, however, for the past week I have been crushing with a friend of mine. 

On the one hand, it is a recent (and most likely) ephemeral crush so I am rationalizing it. Although I am 70% certain it is reciprocal I think I don't want to act on it. Firstly, it could destabilize the amazing friendship we already have. But my real fear is making the same mistake as with this recent short relationship: stepping into something while not being emotionally prepared to do so.

I am reaching out to you because I need some help navigating and processing these feelings under a stoic framework. Should I have a conversation with him explaining my situation and why I am not gonna act according to my crush-feelings towards him? How can I digest this while being compassionate and non-judgemental to myself?",Stoicism,1679829761.0,t3_122j5up,0.56,2
How to deal with Non-verbal Abuse?,"So I live with my parents and both are narcissists. After some research, I found out how I was so brainwashed. I was gaslighted throughout my life and now, as a 21-year-old male, they used to abuse me verbally and say that everything was my fault. They would always attack in a group because they are weak and would attack me in one-on-one arguments. Basically, I was the family scapegoat. But somehow, after reading some quotes from Marcus Aurelius, I tried not to be affected by their abuse. I don't reply to them and basically stay silent and not engage them verbally. I work on my computer every day because I work from home. But they found new ways to push my buttons non-verbally. So, near my computer, there was a refrigerator near me and usually, whenever I worked on my computer, I would get hyper-focused because of my ADHD. They noticed this and would bang the refrigerator door turn by turn to get my attention or control of me. They did this basically every day until I got C-PTSD. Now, whenever I hear loud sounds and fast motion, my body goes into flight mode and reacts to their non-verbal actions. So I moved to another room. And after some days, there was some construction going on near my house. The construction workers noticed how I react to loud sounds, so they and my whole family noticed my movements. If I made any sound while typing or clicking my mouse, they would intentionally make loud noises with things accordingly to my actions rhythm. What can I do here?

Would the marketing stoic sentence Socrates to death for valuing virtue and the gods over money gained by marketing?,"Vote this topic down to vote to put Socrates to death.  Vote it up to spare his life.

Socrates addresses the marketing stoic who is concerned with book sales and rankings for their stoicism books which never quote the Stoicism's patron saint Socrates.  Socrates addresses the marketing stoic with, ""Why do you who are a citizen of the great and mighty and wise city of Athens, care so much about laying up the greatest amount of money and honor and reputation, and so little about wisdom and truth and the greatest improvement of the soul, which you never regard or heed at all? Are you not ashamed of this?""  How come the marketing stoic never contemplates the stars nor physics nor poetry nor the virtue of the soul?

As the modern marketing books put Socrates to death, Socrates addresses them coolly and calmly, like a stoic:
""Strange, indeed, would be my conduct, O men of Athens, if I who, when I was ordered by the generals whom you chose to command me at Potidaea and Amphipolis and Delium, remained where they placed me, like any other man, facing death; if, I say, now, when, as I conceive and imagine, God orders me to fulfil the philosopher's mission of searching into myself and other men, I were to desert my post through fear of death, or any other fear; that would indeed be strange, and I might justly be arraigned in court for denying the existence of the gods, if I disobeyed the oracle because I was afraid of death: then I should be fancying that I was wise when I was not wise. For this fear of death is indeed the pretence of wisdom, and not real wisdom, being the appearance of knowing the unknown; since no one knows whether death, which they in their fear apprehend to be the greatest evil, may not be the greatest good. Is there not here conceit of knowledge, which is a disgraceful sort of ignorance? And this is the point in which, as I think, I am superior to men in general, and in which I might perhaps fancy myself wiser than other men, - that whereas I know but little of the world below, I do not suppose that I know: but I do know that injustice and disobedience to a better, whether God or man, is evil and dishonorable, and I will never fear or avoid a possible good rather than a certain evil. And therefore if you let me go now, and reject the counsels of Anytus, who said that if I were not put to death I ought not to have been prosecuted, and that if I escape now, your sons will all be utterly ruined by listening to my words - if you say to me, Socrates, this time we will not mind Anytus, and will let you off, but upon one condition, that are to inquire and speculate in this way any more, and that if you are caught doing this again you shall die; - if this was the condition on which you let me go, I should reply: Men of Athens, I honor and love you; but I shall obey God rather than you, and while I have life and strength I shall never cease from the practice and teaching of philosophy, exhorting anyone whom I meet after my manner, and convincing him, saying: O my friend, why do you who are a citizen of the great and mighty and wise city of Athens, care so much about laying up the greatest amount of money and honor and reputation, and so little about wisdom and truth and the greatest improvement of the soul, which you never regard or heed at all? Are you not ashamed of this? And if the person with whom I am arguing says: Yes, but I do care; I do not depart or let him go at once; I interrogate and examine and cross-examine him, and if I think that he has no virtue, but only says that he has, I reproach him with undervaluing the greater, and overvaluing the less. And this I should say to everyone whom I meet, young and old, citizen and alien, but especially to the citizens, inasmuch as they are my brethren. For this is the command of God, as I would have you know; and I believe that to this day no greater good has ever happened in the state than my service to the God. For I do nothing but go about persuading you all, old and young alike, not to take thought for your persons and your properties, but first and chiefly to care about the greatest improvement of the soul. I tell you that virtue is not given by money, but that from virtue come money and every other good of man, public as well as private. This is my teaching, and if this is the doctrine which corrupts the youth, my influence is ruinous indeed. But if anyone says that this is not my teaching, he is speaking an untruth. Wherefore, O men of Athens, I say to you, do as Anytus bids or not as Anytus bids, and either acquit me or not; but whatever you do, know that I shall never alter my ways, not even if I have to die many times.

Stoa Basics,"When we talk about our school, we have to answer four basic questions:
1.Why do I invest my time in discussing Stoa?
2.What is Stoa?
3.Why is the real essence of the system reduced to profane bonmots?
4.What should I do if I want to become a real Stoic?
1.Why do I invest my time in discussing Stoa?
The result of almost all human activity is dependent on the original motivation of the agent. The result of every mental effort will differ if the basic motivation is a sort of intellectual exhibitionism and desire for appearing smart or a genuine striving for profound understanding about: why do we exist, what is the coordinate system of our existence and what does this mean for our life-forming. The latter motivation needs a very strong impulse, mostly initiated by feeling pain.
It is pretty shallow and amateurish to assume after reading a little bit of Epictetus, a little bit of Lucius Annaeus Seneca or Marcus Aurelius Antoninus to possess at least some decent knowledge about the doctrine. This is the same as assuming being a physicist by reading a couple of articles about quantum physics in a popular journal.
2.What is Stoa?
Stoa is the science of living and dying well. Science is the ordered sum of cognitive impressions (systema ek katalepseon as the Greeks would say) serving a final end in life, in our case – the happy life. Stoa is NOT an original encapsulated system but the pinnacle of development of millennia old human thought in the form of an ordered and coherent doctrine explaining: a) the functioning of the Universe and its principles; b) the functioning of the human being; c) the resulting implications about human activity, both internal and external.
The roots of our ‘systema’ are to be sought in pre-dynastic Egyptian times (the concept of Ma’at) and Sumeric Me with analogues in Aryan pre-philosophic beliefs which can be spotted for example in the Rigveda. This knowledge evolved throughout the millennia and by students of ancient wisdom like Linus and Orpheus reached Greece. It survived the Dark Ages and blossomed out in Ionia, Greece proper and the Greek colonies in Italy during the 7th to the 3rd centuries BCE and was shaped by men like Alkman, Pherecydes, Acusilaus, Hermotimus, Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes, Pythagoras, Hippasus, Xenophanes, Heraclitus, Epicharmus, Parmenides, Melissus, Empedocles, Philolaus, Archytas, Ecphantus, Anaxagoras, Protagoras, Democritus, Archelaus, Diogenes of Apolonia, Hippocrates, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Antisthenes, Diogenes of Synope, Krates, Theletos, Kercides, Demonakt, Oenomaus. During the Hellenistic Period many schools tried to sum up the ancient knowledge in a system but only Zeno of Citium and Chrysippus of Soli succeeded in shaping a system which is comprehensive, coherent and free of contradictions. Yes, the Stoa is the crowning jewel of millennia old development of human thought.
It is a highly sophisticated and complicated doctrine explaining on the basis of principles and definitions, how the Universe developed, what laws it abides, how it moves and to what end, in how far is the activity of entities within the Universe predetermined and to what degree. The doctrine explains the structure of the human soul, its attributes and functioning and defines the valuation basis for determining the essence of things in life.
What is NOT Stoa:
It is wrong to reduce our school to some practical advice. This profanization is insofar counterproductive as without the knowledge about the fundamental dogmata, advice is bound to fail at one moment or another. As Lucius Annaeus Seneca says: “Advice is not teaching; it merely engages the attention and rouses us, and concentrates the memory, and keeps it from losing grip. But it is a feeble thing unless it is derived from general principles – that is, unless it is based upon knowledge of the actual dogmata of philosophy and its main headings. For precepts will be of no avail while the mind is clouded with error; only when the cloud is dispersed will it be clear what one’s duty is in each case.”
And: the system is not closed. The men of ancient time left us plenty of stuff to dissect, analyze and explain. It is not for consumers but for true sportsmen and soldiers. In order to excel you need to apply the dogmata in your everyday life. But one is for sure: if you embrace with your whole heart this wisdom, you will never again encounter pain, fear, disappointment; you will be protected in all matters, against every spear of Fortune.
3.Why is the real essence of the system reduced to profane bonmots?
There are following main reasons:
The doctrine in itself is complicated and demands outstanding intellectual abilities. The next difficulty: not a single work from the Old Stoa and from the Presocratic philosophers has survived. What remained are, at least concerning our Stoics, mostly quotations in works of mostly hostile commentators living many centuries later. These quotations were summed up by Hans von Arnim about a century ago in his Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta. Unfortunately the quotations are in Greek and Latin, so only a very limited circle has an access to them. And these who have read them up to now either a) have no ‘right’ motivation and/or b) lack sufficient overview and abilities to reconstruct the teaching in its entirety and/or c) are so “polluted” by their environment that they strive in reality for things diametrically opposed to our dogmata.
4.What should I do if I want to become a real Stoic?
First and foremost: you must analyze honestly and in detail the person you are now. Then make acquaintance with the basic dogmata of our system. You should weigh up all influences in your life and decide whether you want to become a man like Zeno and Chrysippus or not. It does not mean that you are bad, stupid or a coward if you decide you are not born to be one of us. But if you decide that it is your destiny to be a Stoic, then you should show resolution and firmness of spirit and follow your dogmata even in the face of death. And what is the promise? You will gain a life of reason, a life of freedom, a life of eternal tranquility and a life of mastery – the mastery over your own self.

I have just finished reading Musonius Rufus and while I understand that he advocates loving I do not understand how he justifies this. How do Stoics justify loving others?,"I received Rufus' complete works for Christmas, a short read of 100 pages (the shorter the better as far as I'm concerned!). As I understand, he believes in God, defines the good as the will of the Gods and his ethics are that we should eschew comforts and act according to reason. I accept all of this.What I do not understand is how he justifies his compassion, which is actually very extreme, based on his metaphysical priors.

How can I use Stoicism to deal with the feelings of rejection and embarrassment?,"Long story short, last month someone I was in a long distance ""relationship"" with broke up with me. We were ""together"" since January. I spent pretty much everyday focused on her. I had just moved and instead of getting my place together I spent most of my money on her or going to see her. I had one moment where I acted weird in March and I thought we talked about it in detail since then. But last time I saw her she didn't really want to be around me. When I left that's when she sent me the breakup message. Before I had even touched down.


I just feel stupid, hurt and embarrassed because it has been YEARS since I even attempted to invest as much of my emotions into someone. I have been dating other women since. Some that have even showed major attraction towards me. But I still feel like shit. I feel like an idiot, a loser, less of a man, unattractive, embarrassed. I've been getting high everyday to try to push it in the back of my head but it hurts. I hate how I feel.

 I've been trying to meditate, work on mindfulness but none of that is working. So I've been reading about stoicism lately and have been wondering how I could use it to get over these feelings. I have lurked here for a bit and just like the vibe and helpfulness from everyone here and would just like to know from you guys how I could implement this philosophy into dealing with this situation and my life as a whole from here on out.

i’m in a state i can’t come out of.,"i don’t know what to do. It seems life just isn’t even worth it anymore. I hold back some of what i want to say so i won’t get reported. But at this point i’m just very deeply depressed. As a 20 yo i honestly hate myself and how my life is. I’ve gotten myself addicted to porn and weed. I have zero friends. I have no social circle. I barely make enough money to even think about saving because i have all these bills which keeps getting higher and higher. I just don’t know what to do. I hate this city (Memphis) and honestly i hate this country. Now i literately only see porn weed and junk food as a crutch or escape. I’ve went on sprees of self improving. Like doing pushups….even had went to the gym for 3 days (there was a free pass)
Today i realized that watching all this self improvement is making me feel worse without me even realizing it…thanks healthygamergg. Also i’ve been beating my self esteem up with these dating apps. I’ve only done it so long because last year this time i met my ex who was my first/last gf. It’s been a year now. She reached out checked up on me and ended up blocking me after i said “thanks i’ll keep that in mind” when she said…”you never use your handsome profile pics. I go around seeing the places she’s taken me and i feel a sinking feeling in my heart. Apparently i wasn’t a good enough guy for her to post on her tik tok when we dated….even though there’s like three others. I just feel like a crumb honestly. Especially to women….i don’t even want to continue talking about women. I’m tired of talking about women….i want to talk TO women but it seems impossible. That dating app was the only intereaction i had with them. I would be lucky if i even got a RESPONSE to whatever i would send…it was hinge btw. I knew they gave like 8 free likes and i could comment something so i would spend time tryna say something and get ignored for months and occasionally some would reply but then ghost and unmatch. 

Today just seems to be going horrible for me. I tried quitting za but failed again. Probably gonna relapse to porn when i put this phone down and “go to bed” then wake up “ smoke some apple…yes actually apple…if you know you know.

I know i have so much more to offer. I want to be able to make cool cars and stuff. I’ve been so interested in this program called blender where i make 3D cars. I used to be like top tier at drawing cars. It’s like something everyone knows me for. They don’t know about the porn addict or the drug addict. Or the guy who can’t talk to girls or no friends. 


I even went to a car show today by myself  because i was attempting to at least do something out of the house and it just made me feel worse. 


if you read this and some of my other posts…you’ll see i’m lost beyond return. I don’t know what else to do",Stoicism,1695343151.0,t3_16owf1t,0.38,0

Is participating in this community enabling Reddit’s greed?,"This is my first post here but I’ve been a member of the community for months and I love it. This community has taught me a lot about Stoicism and I’m looking forward to learning a lot more!

Reddit has changed. Like most users I was cautiously optimistic about Reddit’s going public but I’m afraid the worst has happened. They have prioritized share holder profits over the communities that made Reddit what it is in the first place. 

What the shareholders want is money and if enough communities abandon Reddit for their recent changes they will lose money and shareholders will then be incentivized to pay attention to what the users want I.e. we could get a seat at the table for decision making. If they don’t have the option but to pay attention to our needs then they will have to. Makes sense right? It’s how all strikes work lol. 

I’m afraid that participation in this community that I love is also enabling Reddit’s greed.

In defense of Cold Showers! and why they really ARE Stoic!,"Yesterday I posted in this sub on the benefits of cold showers. This was met with many misjudged misinterpretations of my original point, which I feel has been taken out of context. I have gone away to think and here is an answer as to why this IS **stoicism in action**. I was shocked to see so many 'upset' individuals over something as insignificant as cold water exposure... It also confused me as to how so many queried why it was posted in a Stoicism sub, asking, ""How does this relate to stoicism?"" and questioning my own understanding of the subject... despite my own deeply held understanding that this is a meditation on living stoically; nothing more, nothing less. It is my personal opinion that to really understand a great mystery, one must throw oneself into it and learn firsthand, rather than 'bitch' from a place of comfort. That said, I have read the comments and believe the following sums up why **cold showers really ARE Stoic**. This is the last I will say on the matter. Many were questioning my reasons for posting; some suggesting it was ego-massaging. I admit that the vernacular of the post was something of a 'call to arms', but believe me... when stepping into ice cold water, you need something to rouse the spirit in my experience and it was simply what I say to myself and what works for me. If the post can work for someone else who needs that same 'call to arms' to get their life in order in some small way, stepping into discomfort, then I have done what I intended to. For those whom it rings true, find more on my own sub where we will discuss and learn The Way r/Samuraimindset. For those who still take issue with this, then it is simply not for you and I wish you well in your own education on the great Stoics...

&#x200B;

Let’s start with the dynamic of desire and aversion. Human beings, as well as animals, make a discernment between the things they like and don’t like. This mechanism is valuable for survival: avoiding certain things that are life-threatening can literally save our lives. That’s why zebras avoid lions, and also why I avoid standing in the middle of a fire. 

However, So often people avoid a simple discomfort that isn’t life-threatening, but, actually, *necessary* for personal growth. If we always avoid the things we averse, we’ll never be able to achieve certain goals. If we want a muscular body, we need to go to the gym. If we want to be heard, we need to speak up. But what holds us back? The fear of discomfort.

**Here is a quote from Stoic philosopher and statesman Seneca:**

***It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare, but because we do not dare, things are difficult.*** 

***Seneca,*** [***Moral Letters To Lucilius***](https://amzn.to/2Vf4J4N)***, 26***

*In other words:* if we want things to become easier, we should become braver. This is where cold showers come in.

I think that most people are quite averse to cold showers, since most of them are used to hot streaming water at home, which makes bathing rather a comforting and soothing experience than a refreshing and invigorating one. Thus, in general, people that are used to bathing in warm water will avoid the discomfort of cold showers.

**Here’s a quote from Stoic philosopher Epictetus:**

***Remember that following desire promises the attainment of that of which you are desirous; and aversion promises the avoiding that to which you are averse. However, he who fails to obtain the object of his desire is disappointed, and he who incurs the object of his aversion wretched.***

***Epictetus,*** [***Enchiridion***](https://amzn.to/2ybMcNG)***, 2***

End quote. In this context, the idea behind taking cold showers is that we deliberately expose ourselves to what we averse. We might desire nice, warm water on our skin, but we give ourselves the opposite instead. By doing this, we train ourselves in becoming more resilient towards the things we do not like. It creates a mindset of *acknowledging not liking something and doing it anyway.* The more we do this, the less wretched we’ll be when incurring what we averse.

Ancient Roman emperor and [Stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDVYjnosumiBpWeHOB_f3cAniD3FPmFFe) advised us to engage in the [Praemeditatio Malorum](https://youtu.be/AYhlVwy8C6E) (translated: *negative visualization)* in the morning, to prepare ourselves for the adversity we could meet during the day ahead.

*When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can’t tell good from evil.*

***Marcus Aurelius,*** [***Meditations***](https://amzn.to/3a9rVpo)***, 2-1*** 

Now, when visualising adversity is a cognitive way to brace ourselves for pain, taking a cold shower can be considered a negative visualization in action, that prepares us for the difficulties that the day will bring. Because we’ve already faced one demon by taking a cold shower, the threshold of facing other demons becomes lower.

By taking cold showers we train ourselves to just ‘go for it’ when confronted with a potentially painful experience, no matter how much anxiety we experience. Examples of such experiences are telling someone bad news or a difficult confrontation at work. The cold shower teaches us that, no matter how dreadful something is at first; when we push through we will adapt and it will become bearable. 

Some hardships may be excruciating at first, but after a while they become integrated and we suffer a lot less. I kind of dread public speaking for example. But I’ve learned that, like a cold shower, the beginning is the worst, and when I’m a few minutes in, the discomfort goes away. 

The ability to push through anxiety means that fear won’t stop you, no matter how terrible it feels. This way, we will open doors that we previously didn’t dare to open. And by opening those doors we find pathways to new possibilities because we have liberated ourselves from the chains of fear.

The experience with cold showers learns us to *trust* that we *will* cope, even when our minds tell us the opposite.

*Courage* is a Stoic virtue. Taking cold showers is a way to *build* courage, by conquering ourselves in the face of discomfort, instead of going down the easy road.

Cold showers are small daily victories over pain, and function as a metaphor for how we approach our daily confrontations with the things we averse, which are, whether we like it or not, part of our existence as human beings.",Stoicism,1675720108.0,t3_10vj96p,0.6,3
I walk among pigs.,"The new guy came to work feeling sick, he hopped he would get better, he got worse, he's sitting on a corner with his mask. Everyone is avoiding him because it can be Covid, the guy is nervous because his wife is pregnant, and covid and pregnancy donigo well together.

Come back to the guy, he says he can wait, asks for medicine though, there's none, so I thought of a guy a work with who's always handing people pills when they need it, he says ""oh no, tell him I don't have it, I could get in trouble for medicating him""

Some rambling I wanted to share.,"I began my journey with epictetus enchiridion and now moved to the discourses which have been quite an experience. I come to the conclusion that what I formerly known or read on stoicism pages like the ones on here are highly flawed and even contrarian to the original teachings. Esecially in the relation to violence and stepping up for yourself as I see people falsely idolizing being a doormat and yes passive with the excuse its just an indifferent. Usually that gets twisted in the other way as people say be indifferent in the wrong sense to those things like defending yourself or protecting your honor but then suddenly for certain other indifferents like they bring this smart saying yeah but what is really meant with indifference is to not be indifferent to indifferents but have a certain double standard in relation to ""uncomfortable things"" like said self defense or violence itself so I come around very weird posts some older some more recent while randomly lurking about people feeling very stoic because they let themselves beaten up humiliated or let that happen to others and I dont think that this behaviour is stoic or virtuous and rather cowardly and vicious. I think a good example can be found in discourses 4.10 called What we should despise and what should we especially value? There Epictetus specifically talks about correct action or practice in the real world using the example of Hercules the graecoroman demigod who is like the idol of what a stoic should be and he certainly was absolutely not opposed to violence even bordering real savagery at times. To quote the passage ""What would Heracles have been if he had said, ´How can I prevent a huge lion from coming my way, or a huge boar, or a savage man?´ If a huge boar comes along, the contest that you engage in will be all  the greater, if wicked men come along, you´ll rid the world of wicked men.´ ´But what if I should die in doing so ?´ You´ll die as a good person, accomplishing a noble deed.

I am quite sure that one shouldnt necessarily take it only literally and I dont think it is intended to be so but in no way is it also just intended to be taken as a pure metaphor with the beasts being generally hardhips of life like illnesses or other unpleasant stuff and especially the last part referring to wicked men seems to be very literally meant though of course considering the time the danger of wild animals like boars and lions was quite present as well in a very literal sense. Also I think it shows that this philosophy apart from the cosmopolitian view is very elitist and ""judgy"" not in a hateful sense of course but rather in a way to educate and Epicetus does this quite often and may I say generously?

In no way do I propose brainless violence or taking enjoyment in hurting others but rather I want to throw this in here as I believe that that may help some people understanding and applying stoicism better as the ancient philosophy it is and not as the shallow self help hippie formula it has become in my view. So yeah what do you think? Have I misunderstood it? I have to be honest I suspect many people will dislike and dismiss that as they will say thats lower case stoicism or broicsm dude, thats not what what Stoicism is about its about social justice and lgtbq rights dude but I dont care about those things as I think that is equally wrong and stupid like those sites who say how to become a quadtrillionaire with stoicism in 3 weeks lol",Stoicism,1638279272.0,t3_r5nefd,0.39,0
Do you find Stoicism to be True? Does Stoicism transform?,"Do you find Stoicism to be true or do you use it to cope? I'd like to see the lives of the people who call themselves Stoics. All the best people I look at who live good lives would not fall in the category of Stoic.

I wonder if sayings like ""Pain is inevitable, suffering is a choice"" is actually true or if it is just pleasing to hear and comforting to the soul. Even falsehoods can be pleasing to hear and truth can be difficult to bear.

If you take away the extravagance of Stoic literature, what you get is Aristotelian virtue ethics and Platonic philosophy. That classical though seems to be at odds with the modern thought paradigm.

I think stoicism is wrong and you should be effected by outside events,"Reason be, my friend in highschool used to be very overweight. he was bullied for it which caused/convinced him to lose weight so he was not made fun of by other people anymore. If he followed the stoic guidelines of ""not caring what others think"" then he might have not cared what people thought and continued to live his unhealthy lifestyle. But because he cared what others thought of him he changed his lifestyle.

I have another example as well. At work I was working with someone who didn't speak English very well, up to the point where it was slowing the business down and causing problems. Eventually i got annoyed, told the manager and she moved her position to somewhere else. Now the work environment has much less tension and runs smoother.

Is stoicism actually compatible with human nature?,"I've done a lot of reading in psych/neuroscience, from very esoteric philosophical guys like Carl Jung to uncompromisingly atheistic guys like Richard Dawkins and Stephen Pinker. The common theme I'm seeing is that a lot of what stirs our emotions and matters to us is innate and immutable.

Obviously we can use our PFC to exercise will power and things like psychedelics and advanced stages of meditation both show that a radical transformation in how the mind works, even only a temporary one, is beyond doubt at this point.

Still, i have my doubts if Stoicism can ever be more than an idealistic set of tennets about how people should be which can be imitated, acted out, but can't ever authentically change who you are inside and what you feel.

I mean I'd like to believe it's true because we all have extremely fucked up things happen to us and with todays SJWs talking about ""toxic masculinity"" the virtue of emotional strength, stoicism, is under attack more than ever.

I can't help feeling it might not be ""real"" though. You can act stoic but can't BE stoic",Stoicism,1560940214.0,t3_c2fe3s,0.56,2

Stoic Physics and Quantum Mechanics,"Greetings to fellow list members. It has been a while since I participated in this group.  
I have been busy. My interest in Stoicism is summed up by an article that I've just 
posted on my blog entitled 

**[Stoic Physics and Quantum Mechanics](http://www.thefirstscience.org/stoicphysics/)**
Here is the abstract:

>In this article I briefly present the case that Stoic natural philosophy 
>provides the missing meta-language to finally make sense of 
>quantum mechanics. Modern Stoic writers such as Lawrence C Becker 
>dismiss Stoic physics as an embarrassment. Becker tries to cobble 
>together a hybrid of Stoic ethics with what is essentially a modern 
>version of Epicurean physics. The result is an Epicurean Stoicism, an 
>oxymoron if ever there was one. To Chrysippus, the very core of ethics 
>arises from the fundamental physical principles of matter. If Stoic 
>physics is as Becker describes it merely a ""flippant speculation about 
>physical processes,"" it is hard to see that Stoic ethics could possibly 
>escape the same epitaph.

I would be interested in your comments. Please feel free to pass this on to your 
more technically inclined friends to get their comments too.
So far I've written a 450 page book The First Science and the Generic Code which 
has not been reviewed as yet (be the first!). The book has a heavy and constant 
Stoic theme. Some readers have told me that they have read it cover to cover half 
a dozen times or more but this has not lead to a wider audience as yet. This is 
probably because it is self-published and I lack time for promotion. I have a 
second book in the pipeline.

I have also written a number of papers that can be found on my website.
 All centre around Stoic logic as a blueprint for an alternative but complementary 
paradigm  for the foundations of science. 
The most significant is entitled 
[The Universal Geometric Algebra of Nature:Realising Leibniz's Dream]( http://www.thefirstscience.org/current-papers/)
Here is the abstract:

>Many researchers in the field of Geometric Algebra claim it to be the 
>universal language of mathematics and physics and so realise 
>Leibniz's vision. Their claim has some merit. However, Leibniz's 
>geometry without number vision was much more ambitious. For 
>example, Leibniz claimed that the geometry would explain the forms 
>of plants and animals 'in a few letters.' Since the discovery of the 
>genetic code, we now know such a code indeed does exist. However, 
>Geometric Algebra makes no reference to the genetic code, the truly 
>authentic algebra of Nature. In this paper we work closely with 
>Leibniz's core concepts, together with a strong Stoicism influence, and 
>show how his approach to metaphysics and geometric algebra can be 
>made tractable. The end result is a geometric algebra based on a 
>four-letter alphabet. The four letters are shown to correspond to the 
>geometric semantics of timelike, lightlike, spacelike, and singular 
>vectors of a geometric algebra. We propose an exact mapping of 
>these four generic letters to those of the genetic code. Thus, the 
>genetic code is interpreted as expressing generic geometric 
>organisation based on a Leibniz style geometric algebra rather than 
>being a mere transcription code as stated in the Central Dogma of 
>biochemistry..

>The overall picture presented here is that of metaphysics playing the 
>role of an operational science much like Heaviside's Operational 
>Calculus does in providing the much simpler synchronic alternative to 
>the traditional analysis of time series. Like Leibniz, we claim that this 
>new operational approach to science and philosophy can explain not 
>just the generic forms of the animate, but also the inanimate.

Unlike in my early days before I moved away from purely technical and quite 
orthodox papers, I am having trouble getting my work published. I submitted the 
above paper to the Foundations of Science journal, together with a proposed list 
of what I thought were ten of the world top people in their field. The paper was 
not accepted but the long referee comments were interesting. One of the kinder 
referees wrote in his long set of comments:

>The paper is very ambitious. It is, in short, an attempt to mathematize 
>metaphysics, to find the universal mathematical code that underlies 
>all being. But in attempting to explain so much, it runs close to not 
>explaining much at all. The one application the author gives, the 
>explanation of the preferred chirality of living organisms, is not very 
>convincing. 

He then goes on to say that the paper ""could be a game changer, but.."" In a later 
paper that I am rewriting, I do provide the missing  areas of application and so do 
not despair.

In the Paper I am writing at the moment, I am just blown away by the hidden 
subtleties in Chrysippus' Stoic logic. My ambitious project is reaching fruition. 
Maybe you will be able to say that you read about it first here!
Note that my work is not a scholarly approach to Stoicism and so may conflict 
with certain established orthodoxies. I appreciate the forensic work of the 
scholars, but my approach is to reverse engineer Stoicism from first principles.  I 
try to follow the line of Chrysippus. As he said to Cleanthes, ""Give me the dogmas and I will 
find the proofs.""

As a final note, as one can see you need to be very Stoic in more ways than one to 
work for so long and so alone on this kind of project!
Best wishes to all.

"Someone I looked up to told me to ""literally rot in hell"", instead of lashing out I moved on.","I got covid two weeks ago and posted on my private story ""I love having covid this is the happiest I've been in weeks"", because I live in an abusive household and for the first time in a long time they got to leave me alone. A lot of people miss-interpreted what i was saying and subtweeted me on twitter. One of my close friends even said something snarky about it, but I made an effort to talk it out with her to preserve the relationship. 

My best friend (let's call her emma) told me that this other girl, laura, was really mad about what i said and Emma would not go into specifics about what Laura was saying. Laura is a grade older than me and I always thought she was super cool and I really wanted to get to know her better. Emma told me that Laura was ranting on her private story so she did not get the whole thing but I could tell she was holding back. Because she was not being upfront with me I knew there was more to the story and I instantly got really triggered and I struggle with self harm so I decided I was going to self harm that night because I was so upset. Later I asked my friend Emma what Laura said again in hopes I would get a forward answer and Emma said it was on Laura's twitter. I looked everywhere for this girl's twitter and when I found it I saw that she made a tweet that said that I should ""literally rot in hell"" for getting covid and being happy about it. She also unfollowed me on all of my socials which obviously hurt because I wanted to maintain a relationship with her. I spent the next half an hour crying really hard and self harming, but I realized that I don't have control over what Laura thinks or feels and I should not waste time blaming myself. I had cut deeper tonight then I ever had and I just wanted to keep going which scared me. So instead, I went on a really intense run and put on music really loud in my headphones.

Why do I get a longer life than others?,"I think of so many celebrities who died at a very young age. Chadwick Boseman, for example who was not only a remarkable actor, but an incredible human being.

I work to make a company rich. Thats my life. What do i get? 18 bucks an hour! Gee, sounds great. That means i can't afford any place to live unless my wages magicly go up another $20 bucks an hour!

Ex moving on too quickly.,"I do not want to get into too much details but I just wanted to vent things out. She was my first love. We were in a on-off relationship for 5 years. She breakups with me a lot for a reason like she can't love or ""its not you, its me"" type of shit. I thought she was pretty great as a partner so tho I regret now, I usually am the one that is reaching out to come back together. We usually comeback together after a few months for five years. WE never lasted a year tbh.  
  
We were pretty immature i know but one thing is for certain is that I loved her genuinely. Our last relationship lasted for almost a year. Almost. She wanted to breakup. I didn't accept it at first because i thought she was being impulsive again but after a week I decided to let her go though it was hard. I regret that I begged to her to stay and im cringing rn but we learn from mistakes. No one should beg to be loved. Now, I wasn't the perfect partner. I was needy, obsessive maybe, and overthinker. My mental space got the better of me you know. But I dont give up. Im the type of person that would say ""I dont want to lose you, lets fix things"" but seems like she didn't want that or maybe not from me.  
  
The reason for breaking up this time was a bunch. (1) She fears commitment. We were together a long time but I wasn't given the chance to meet her parents. I wasn't forcing her to let me meet her parents but I find it weird that she seems she doesn't want that. (2) She ""can't"" love again. I know this was her usual reason for breaking up. I can't understand it tho I know i don't have to. (3) She doesn't have the time and space for relationships rn. Tho i find hard to believe because we were together for almost a year and now she just realized this which was weird to me. (4) She just wants to be alone and that she is not happy anymore and she feels like drowning or choking. I respect that reason tbh. When she said that I knew I had to let her go. I wanted her to be happy. In the end (i regret asking rn), in which i asked ""Do you promise once your ready, you'll chose me?"" and she said yes. The relationship ended on good terms. No bad blood. i thought there was a high chance of coming back together again.  
  
After a few months, I started that to went to no contact, work on myself, workout, study, work on my portfolio. It was okay. I was dealing with the breakup much better than I was before. Healthily coping with my pain. It was horrible but i know i got through this before. But its only a matter of time before a painful news get to me.  
  
Recently, My family and I was on vacation. I had a great time. When suddenly my friend chatted and broke the news, that she has a new partner, her classmate (we were in different colleges). I saw her account shes flaunting his new guy all over her social medias. There is this specific picture that shows him in her place which means he met her parents. Its only been 4 months. It was horrible. Like your body just sinks. Like every reason that she wanted to breakup was a lie. The promise was a lie. I wanted to cry but I couldn't cause my family is there with me. I never knew I could experience worse pain than I had before. Like i thought she promised. I thought she was better than that. The thoughts, memories, pain came back. Its like my world shattered you know. Thats when you realize that the world is unfair. It was an unimaginable pain that I've been through. You asked yourself a bunch of questions about your self-worth. ""Was I enough?"", ""Was i too much"". ""Was I not worth the risk or pain?"" I realized that she ended the relationship for the sole reason that she does not love me anymore, and the reasons that she gave was just white lies to cushion the blow that she is going to make .I did my best for her and for the relationship. I wanted her to be happy. I like to think of it as like a game of chess, i did all the possible best moves but in the end I still lost. Hopefully, she is happy now, unfortunately not with me.  
  
Its been a month, and Im feeling better but the pain is still there. Im getting better at dealing with my thoughts. But I believe the worst part is the memories. Songs that will remind you of them. Catchphrases that will remind you of them. Places that will remind you of them. It feels like hell. It HURTS like hell. But I know i cant do anything about it anymore. I feel like I already know what I need to do. Work on myself again. Focus on myself. Emotionally heal from this traumatic experience. I just wanted to vent this out. As a man, its hard to find mediums to freely express your emotions.

I have been using stoicism to cope with my pain. Im sure me feeling pain is my own fault. I expected her to be someone that would not do that. I caused my own pain. Its beyond my control anymore. I would like some quotes that would enlighten and bring me clarity. I would also take some book recommendations as I already finished Mediations by Marcus Aurelius and Discourses by Epictetus.

Giving up on practicing Stoicism after 2 months,"Hey community,

I'm reaching out for support as I navigate through some tough times. At 29, I've recently lost my job and ended a 4-year relationship due to my own lack of discipline. These setbacks have left me feeling uncertain about the future and emotionally overwhelmed.

Facing this dual challenge, I've reached out to some stoic learning resources like articles and vlogs and ended up recognizing that I need to cultivate **Courage** and **Temperance** to tackle the emotional aftermath. 

Over the past two months, I've attempted Stoic exercises such as Journaling, Premeditatio Malorum, and Negative Visualization to find solace and direction.

Is it hard to live a stoic life in the USA?,"Some background (and don't be offended, which maybe you would):

I am originally from Hungary. For those that don't know, it has a thousand years old culture stemmed in nomadic lifestyle, wars, and creative adaptability in extreme measures, it lost two world wars, 70 percent of its land, and then was occupied by the Nazies and then by the Soviets for about 45 years -both of whom did genocides- and had to pay war reparations, had the highest inflation in human history, and had about 5-6 revolutions and changes of state form in a century, and now is being ruled by a corrupt regime. And people live their lives.

I decided about 4 years ago, that I will soon move the USA to live the American dream. For that to make money, I worked in a Scandinavian country, where I started to somewhat doubt that I want to live around people who are not cold, stoic, and non-problematic in the Nordic way. I know personally many American people very closely, and even lived with them.

My concern is that maybe not only Western people cannot take life seriously, but they even pull others into this non-serious approach, and their lives are full of noise, sugar, air conditioner, lukewarmness, and many has a physique, intelligence and communicational style not compatible with normal human survival, and they are sometimes so entitled that they get offended by the existence of another person, or by somebody having an opinion that they label as ""not nice"". And they always ask ""how are you"", and deep and personal questions in situations where there is no place for that, and they expect you to give a shallow and indifferent anwser regarding your own life.

On the other hand, I love freedom, I am a very risk-taking and innovative person, and I like to create value while nobody is trying to use force on me, and I have a big dream of building up a business and having a nice and big family in the USA and live the American dream.

Is my concern legit, or is it possible to live a normal productive life in the USA?",Stoicism,1690967543.0,t3_15g3vxt,0.7,28
hi,"hi nice to meet every one. i'm fairly new to stoicism, been aware of for a long long time but never really paid much attention to it. lately i've been reading some of the available material and realized that over a life time of experience i've come to many similar conclusions. like trying to accept things for what they are instead of what you want them to be and you'll rarely be disappointed. 

it will be nice to learn more about the philosophy and how to implement it.

I made an inappropriate joke to someone and their reply was hurtful. How do I subvert my expectations of being apologized to?,"This is a fake scenario based off of a real problem I'm having.

I'm confused in how to feel and how to respond to they way someone reacted to a joke I made.

So let's say I, Jack, made a joke about vegans to my friend Mark, who is not a vegan but has told me previously that they don't like jokes at the expense of vegans.

After telling my joke, Mark said ""shut up, that's offensive"".

Now, upon reflection I realized that I made a mistake. There's no doubt in my mind that the initial mistake was mine. However I still feel hurt due to being told to shut up.

I have apologized for making the joke, and Mark hasn't apologized for his response. I feel like I expect him to apologize. Should I not?

This is something which isn't yet clear to me in the stoic teachings. I lack ""the wisdom to know the difference"". I know his apology is out of my control, but should (or could) I tell him that it was hurtful and that I would like if he doesn't do it again?

Or do I just change my expectations to such a degree in which I won't expect to be treated with any respect?

The Joy of Marriage and child rearing should be experienced by us Stoic Practitioners.,"A passage from the book “A Guide to the Good Life - The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy” by William B. Irvine (pg. 140-141), tells us of marriage while quoting Musonius Rufus. 

“A wise man, Musonius says, ‘will marry, and having married, he and his wife will work hard to keep each other happy. Indeed, in a good marriage, two people will join in a loving union and will try to outdo each other in the care they show for each other. Such a marriage, one imagines, will be very happy. And having married, a wise man will bring children into the world. No religious procession’, Musonius says, ‘is as beautiful as a group of children guiding their parents through the city, leading them by the hand and taking care of them. Few people’, Musonius would have us believe, ‘are happier than the person who has both a loving spouse and devoted children.’”

Let us find that person who loves us, and who we love in return. A partnership embodied by virtue. What could aid more in your own journey than a good traveling partner? 

Bringing children into the world, educating them, being there for them, sharing in their joys and their failures, becoming old, sending good humans onto the same journey that we ourselves carried all those years, then dying a peaceful death. 

What a joy!",Stoicism,1638074836.0,t3_r3w3ru,0.75,129

Evil People (thoughts from Marcus in the wake of the Orlando shooting),"> In Book Nine of the Meditations, Marcus Aurelius has some useful advice--very hard to follow, but useful nonetheless--about what to do when people act badly.

Is stoicism giving up?,"I used to be a stoic before I understood merit and healthy pride.. I was a big stoic.

Always wanted kids. Everyone that worshipped the dollar wound up with kids and careers. They won. 

So how does being ok with where you're at get you anywhere? Isn't it like giving up? Isn't it like the celibate Buddhist monk?

How do I step out of this mindset?,"(For context I am 13) Every night I feel like I am the single worst person in the world and that mainly is because of my bad points.
I have this problem that I guarantee you probably only like 1000 people in the entire world have.
So when i was six I was tested on my iq because mom was curious.
The results came back saying my iq was not apprehendable with the kind of tests they have.
The most advanced test has a limit of 162 iq.
They diagnosed me way over that limit.
Because there is no test for over 162, they can’t put on a specific number.
So yeah I’m kinda smarter than Einstein.
Woo yeah fast forward to now, 12- 13 years old and I’m in ninth grade 
I know that having a high iq doesn’t mean you know everything without working for it.
Ever since I was a kid I loved videogames.
I used to play cod bo2 for literally days on end.
So as you could probably imagine, I still love them, but I kinda think it’s solely because of the games that I don’t have the best points in my grade.
I think that if I had never met games I would now be the best in my class (probably the best in my school lmao)
If I’m motivated to learn, I will, but if there is any form of device, I will instantly lose that motivation and look at the device.
My parents also don’t get the intensity of my
( I’ll call it addiction). They kinda help me but it doesn’t affect anything I do. 
*different subject*
So it’s not only about the games, but also about learning itself.
When you are in elementary school, you begin to learn things and get tested on those things, 
I got tested too, but for me it was enough to just pay attention in class, the day after, got a 10/10 (an A+ in America i think)
This went on until now, and I am ashamed to say it, but I have NEVER studied in my life.
Now, my school knows I have this capability, and doesn’t really offer me much help, I mean it’s so hard for me to ‘just use these methods’ like they say because I have never ever done anything like studying in my entire life, that’s why I feel like the worst person in the world, having this much capability and all I do with it is play games.",Stoicism,1617093827.0,t3_mgbfm2,0.62,5

Likewise, any good in events also cannot be attributed to the year, but only to the event itself.

Dumb question: doesn’t stoicism sound like gaslighting to non-stoics?,"We know that a stoic idea is “the thing that was said to you did not cause you pain, but instead your perception of it”. If you were to say something to someone, let’s say it’s something that you did not intend to cause emotional pain, but the person who you said it to has a very strong emotional relationship with the topic and therefore what you say causes them distress (eg. they have a bad mental relationship with their body, and have said they want to lose weight, but if you were to ask them how the weight loss goal is going, it would make them feel shitty and guilty) 

If you were to respond to their reaction with stoic ideas such as “what I said did not hurt you, instead your relationship with your body and your emotional perception of that topic caused you to feel bad”, doesn’t that sound like gaslighting?

I don’t know. It’s one of those things where it’s great if a person discovers it on their own, it’s great and beneficial, but if you someone tells them about it, it’s not helpful (referring to stoicism in general here)

Leg Day,"There once was a horse that followed a road through a mountainway. ""This road sucks"", said the horse. A sheep barreled down a slope like a boulder and, upon contact with a car that was using the road and heading in the opposite direction of the horse, proceeded to explode, sending the ignited car barrelling down the slope on the opposite side of the road from the origination of the sheep's journey, and further down the mountain. Eventually the car, a crushed ball of metal at this point, smacked into a boulder. That boulder belonged to Sisyphus. 

Sisyphus let one rip, and screamed at the same time, because now he had been startled by the impact of the car into his boulder, which was now tumbling down the mountain along with the car which was more or less spherically shaped at this point. The car then hit a sheep, a different sheep than the first one mentioned, and the sheep was very upset for about .053 seconds but then went on about its business, which was trafficking customers from one country into another illegally. The car disintigrated as if in a video game, and pixel by pixel, it vanished from reality. 

Sisyphus and his boulder, on the other hand, were still in a tumble. They eventually stopped at the bottom of the slope, finally, after 36 minutes. Sisyphus pulled himself to his feet, and put his hands on the boulder, but by chance glanced at the ground and spotted a dung beetle with its own boulder made of dung. ""Huh."", said Sisyphus.

As I look back on this day, I am trying to find something of value with regards to this story. I no longer get anything from gossip. I do not get enjoyment or comfort from conflict and pain, mine or other's. I get a sense of belonging from other places so no need to use the news media or social media for that.

Just yelled at my mother.,"Time after time in many different ways I fail stoicism and taoism. I don't know how to be like Epictetus, dude's my hero, and Diogenes is the unachievable guy that I wish to be one day, but they're both light years from me.

To put it simply I don't get along with my mother. Since I was a kid, she's pretty toxic when she wants to. But the last couple of years I've working on it, at least not letting this affect my life. 

I struggled to trust people, mainly women, but I've dealt with that demon, like I did others, most recently I learned not to look for female approval, and stopped clingy to their attention.

As much as I'm improving as a man, my relationship with my mother still sucks. Most of the time is okay, she's loving and caring, but like the devil that she is, from time to time she's the personification of pazuzu.

This time after getting home with a stiff neck (I get too tense from work, and I have a few n
Back problems) she's started criticizing me to the rest of the family. Saying that I do everything my way and that's why I'm like this, because I refused to be healed by her spiritual bullshit.

I later then asked her why she was doing that, I didn't say anything, everything was right. So she as usual with all her devilish might started running her yap. I lost it and started yelling at her.

""why are you doing this, I haven't done anything to you. I never did anything to you""


She then leaves and text me one of those peaceful messages that Grandmas share on WhatsApp.

Honestly, I'm not proud, and none of my heros would be either. I'm just tired of all this push and pull, just like the devil. When she's right in the head, she complains that I'm not loving and ignore her. Wouldn't you despise someone that gives you love and then procedes to slap you?

Someone on the subreddit said that Marcus Aurelius says that you should give your enemies your best. I say fuck him! I sometimes regret not killing her when I was an insecure teenager LOL.

I feel isolated always in the attacks on me, I know it's just their opinions, but I have a impulse control problem, always did and probably will while I am alive.  The problem is that the people who help me like to corner me and point out how incompetent I am. 

I get angry and say to myself, fuck all of it, I deserve peace in death and not depending on anything or anyone, even my own abilities or inabilities.

You can say I am irrational or anything, but don't we have the right, even though I personally think suicide is not irrational, you don't have to run every possible scenario to see the experiment of me is wrong. 

Even though Stoicism talks about duty, I personally have a duty to myself first to save myself from any bad experiences more than providing good ones, because there was and there will be always more of bad ones.

This is bad by my own judgement, but I don't think I can affect it that much, as long as I remember I was lazy, angry, impulsive, clumsy, asocial and self-isolating. 

This is more of a pessimistic egoism that I have, let's just say if the world does not owe me anything, I don't owe it virtue. I don't remember signing any contract that I must live.

I really enjoy staying fit and building muscle / toning up, however could this be “unhealthy” or “wrong” in the eyes of the stoics? 

Technically I work out because I enjoy it and I like seeing the progress but subconsciously/consciously I also like doing it because I know other people will find me more “attractive”.

Is Stoicism a Doctrine or Department Store?,"In his insightful comments on my project, www.thestoicguitarist.com, /u/handystoic argued that my approach was more epicurean than stoic. Which got me to thinking about how I approach stoicism and I'd love to hear your thoughts.

I do not approach stoicism as a doctrine or as dogma that must be swallowed whole in order to be used or useful. The disciplines of perception, action and will are VERY useful tools for me. The stoic belief in predestination/predeterminism is NOT something I can really get behind so I don't believe or apply that aspect of it.

This department store approach (buy what you like, leave what you don't), is not dissimilar to how someone like Ryan Holiday thinks about and uses stoicism.

I'm half way into Ego is the Enemy and it's just not doing much for me. It's all: start a chapter with a message, then a cute lil quote, then talk about some examples (that are totally full of shit) about someone in the past making shit up about who that person was behind closed doors, and then saying 'be (or don't be) like these dudes'.

Rinse and repeat.

Stoic Vegetarian/Veganism?,"The ancient stoics ask us to see ourselves not just as a member of a specific family, race or nationality but instead as a member of the larger human race. It seems the stoics were very ahead of their time in this kind of thinking and should be congratulated for that. As modern stoics, should we not strive to similarly have a more expansive circle of empathy then is typical for our time. For myself this has become about expanding my circle to be inclusive of all sentient life (for the record I'm definitely not there yet haha). After all, when Orangutans have been shown to recognize their own reflection and can learn to converse with humans in sign language - is the demarcation we create between ourselves and the rest of animals really so clear? Is the suffering of animals really less important than human suffering?

If we choose to expand our circle of empathy in this way I think a logical stoic would begin to see some discrepancies in how we treat our animal brethren in the 21st century. We have chosen a select few to nurture and love as pets but are actively worsening the lives of most others. For me, the worst effects are seen by the species we have chosen to subject to factory farming. It does not seem like the ancient stoics had any particular judgements on the farming or killing of animals that I'm aware of (although if anybody knows of any would be interested to hear). That being said, they lived in a time of small scale farms where the consumption of meat was not optional as it is in developed countries today. And I want to be clear that I am not saying that there is something inherently unstoic about the killing and/or eating of an animal and I believe that in the right context it is justifiable. In my view the torturous lives of factory farm animals is not that context and I think we need to recognize that our continued consumption of meat from these producers is what fuels that injustice.

I think vegetarian/veganism is also an opportunity to practice the stoic virtues. How regulating one's diet helps with moderation probably needs no explanation and there is certainly wisdom and justice in understanding the larger implications of one's lifestyle and taking action to correct it where able. I find that as a lifestyle choice that places you within a minority, vegetarian/veganism definitely strengthens your courage. Courage to stand by your values even when as I've learned there will be ridicule by others.

TL;DR: 
For me part of being a good stoic is being a vegetarian and being a vegetarian makes me a better stoic.

"As a stoic practice, being male, I wore a skirt to school everyday for three weeks","I went through a long process of reasoning before I decided that this was a virtuous thing to do. Looking back now I also realize it was a very stoic thing to do.

First, within myself I recognized a fear of femininity and ""womanliness."" However, this misogyny is an irrational external impression. Why am I afraid of femininity? Why am I afraid of doing something that can be seen as ""female""? Why would I let a piece of cloth threaten my masculinity and sense of identity. If my identity was this fragile then does not it deserve to be shattered?

I realized that if I were to wear a skirt it would help me work through my fear of femininity. It may sound strange but it helped humanize women for me. For a long time, I had a subconscious idea that women are somehow ""different"" than me or ""weaker"" or more ""vulnerable."" I wanted to rid myself of these harmful external impressions. Wearing a skirt made me realize how useless it was to associate feminine clothing with weakness. Women are humans just like me. This helped me understand this not only on a purely rational level but also on a deeper emotional level.

Secondly, I understood that some of my fear also came from the possible social repercussions. It is terrifying to do something like this as it can be social suicide. I worried about the side long looks I would get and the weird comments. I worried about how people would see me.

However consider this [story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Citium) about Zeno from wikipedia: 

>From the day Zeno became Crates’ pupil, he showed a strong bent for  philosophy, though with too much native modesty to assimilate Cynic  shamelessness. Hence Crates, desirous of curing this defect in him, gave  him a potful of lentil-soup to carry through the Ceramicus; and when he  saw that Zeno was ashamed and tried to keep it out of sight, Crates  broke the pot with a blow of his staff. As Zeno began to run off in  embarrassment with the lentil-soup flowing down his legs, Crates chided,  ""Why run away, my little Phoenician? Nothing terrible has befallen  you.

Diogenes writes that Zeno would “...bid men and women wear the same dress and keep no part of the body entirely covered.” [source](https://medium.com/illumination/the-hardest-stoic-spiritual-exercise-and-why-its-crucial-for-happiness-d98b48ea17ad)

According to the Daly Stoic: [""Cato walked around ancient Rome in unusual clothing—with a goal of getting people to laugh at him.""](https://dailystoic.com/cato/)

As we can see, the practice of being indifferent to social repercussions was common among stoics. So therefore, I resolved to do the same thing.

While wearing the skirt, people made weird comments. People gave me sideways glances. I even got laughed at. This quote from the [Enchiridion of Epictetus](http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html) is relevant to the situation:

>Now, for your part, don't  have a supercilious look indeed; but keep steadily to those things which  appear best to you as one appointed by God to this station. For remember  that, if you adhere to the same point, those very persons who at first  ridiculed will afterwards admire you. But if you are conquered by them,  you will incur a double ridicule.

Indeed, many people came to admire me for doing what I did. Now, the admiration was simply a preferred indifferent. Nevertheless, it was nice to have.

I had to keep in mind that many of these people simply had the same inclinations socialized into them as I did. How could I blame them for having this mindset, which I also had. I had to understand that this was inevitable due to the social taboo of men wearing feminine clothing.

Marcus Aurelius states:

>When people injure you, ask yourself what good or  harm they thought would come of it. If you understand that, you'll feel  sympathy rather than outrage or anger. Your sense of good and evil may  be the same as theirs, or near it, in which case you have to excuse  them. Or your sense of good and evil may differ from theirs. In which  case they're misguided and deserve your compassion. Is that so hard? ([source](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1136555-when-people-injure-you-ask-yourself-what-good-or-harm))

The final reason had to do with the social change and benefit I reasoned that this act would give back to my community. I have many friends who are trans or gender non conforming. One of my friends had come out recently and she had started wearing a skirt. For a long time I was uncomfortable with her wearing a skirt. Yet, this was simply an irrational external impression. It was partly a motivation to rid myself of this fear for why I began to wear a skirt. 

However, I also wanted to show support for her. The experience was an uncomfortable and lonely one for her. I reasoned that if more people were to not conform to society's expectations of gender then life would be much better for those who are trans. I knew that doing this would possibly help others who associate with me overcome their own fears around breaking out of the gender binary. I could make people more comfortable with the idea of someone doing this.

I also knew that this would help me understand better the experiences of those who are trans. Now of course, it would be impossible for me to understand this experience completely if I was not trans, yet wearing a skirt helped me consider more some of the difficulties that our friends in the trans community face. If I was able to personally understand and experience a facet of their lives then I could become a better activist. This by no means makes me an ""expert."" Trans people are the experts on their own experiences, however it is a way for me to understand what they go through better.

So to summarize the reasons for why this would be considered virtuous by stoic standards:

1. It helped me rid myself of and examine irrational misogynistic impressions. (A virtue)
2. It helped me become more comfortable with myself, despite what others may think. (A virtue)
3. It gave support to one of my friends. (A virtue)
4. It may have helped others examine their own external impressions and become more rational (positive indifferent)
5. It helped me gain an improved understanding of the outside world and other communities. (A virtue)",Stoicism,1597379913.0,t3_i9fjr5,0.77,277

The Stoics Were Not Philosophers,"---

Excerpted from the 2022 March 21 ""Daily Stoic Email List""

---

We have this notion that philosophers are academics. Although many of the Stoics teachers, this was rarely if ever their actual profession. Across the first five hundred years of Stoic history, its members form an astonishing spectrum of stations in life. They were soldiers and emperors and public servants and merchants and writers, athletes, parents, daughters and diplomats.

The ancients would then influence and inspire many of history’s greats. Theodore Roosevelt brought Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius on his deadly “River of Doubt” expedition. Thomas Jefferson had Seneca on his nightstand when he died. Toussaint Louverture, the leader of the Haitian Revolution, studied Epictetus as he rose up against Napoleon. Beatrice Webb, who helped to found the London School of Economics and who first conceptualized the idea of collective bargaining, called Meditations her “manual of devotion. Admiral James Stockdale relied on Epictetus to get through his hellish time as a POW.

...

It doesn’t matter what you do, where you are from, or what your station in life is, you can join the ranks of some of the great men and women, past and present. “There is no role,” Marcus Aurelius would write, “so well suited to philosophy as the one you happen to be in right now.” The role of parent. The role of spouse. The role of a person waiting in line. The role of a person who has just been given bad news. The role of a person who is rich. The role of a person sent into exile or delivered into bankruptcy. The role of a person who finds themselves enslaved, literally or otherwise. All of these are suited to philosophy. There is no role in which Stoicism does not help one succeed.

"Was in a dangerous situation, looking for assurance/advice","Hello Stoics.

I have a story from earlier this week that's 100% true. I need to know if I handled it well or I should have changed my behavior in case I'm put through this again

I live in San Francisco and I was in a dangerous area at night (the tenderloin iykyk) for a meeting. After this meeting, most people hang outside the building for a few minutes to chat before going to a bar. 

I decided that I wanted a bit of privacy talking to my girlfriend on the phone before heading over. So I walked two blocks away and called her up. There is a group of people (male and female) across the street hanging out. My gf and I were chit-chatting before an initial man comes up to me trying to push. I politely declined.

Then, a few minutes later I hear some heckling coming from across the street. I wasn't sure if it was directed my way, but ignored it. Then an empty water bottle was thrown my direction. I was not going to be intimidated so I continued to speak on the phone.

 Then, suddenly, two men (who were around my height and weight, 6'1"" 215) come up to me and say they'll ""take that phone off my hands.""

Again, I refuse to be intimidated. I can see a group of people from my meeting walking to the bar across the street. However, one of them quickly shove a gun into my chest.

Basically I said ""I'm out I'm out""  and walked away without a scratch - I even laughed while crossing the street. Because I got away so easily I feel as if they were bluffing and I could have stood my ground longer. As a stoic, I don't want to be rattled or intimidated easily. However, would it have been worth it? What if they weren't?

As stoics, at gunpoint, I have this instinct to be like Tommy Shelby. But that's not realistic. It's about making smart choices.

Gaining redemption from cheating,"My fiance and I were waiting till marriage and I ended up cheating. I honestly don't know why because for the past several years I thought I had my sexual urges under control. I had no reason to cheat as she was absolutely the best person I had ever met and my life with her was amazing with an amazing future.

A lot of stoicism reflects on inevitable hardships that life brings on you, but I was wondering if anyone could share sources that speak on hardships you brought on yourself and the pain the comes with immense regret and self-hatred. 

I honestly cannot figure out why, and have been meditating on it to no avail. I barely remember details of the cheating and cannot think of my motivation.

How do I stay calm when I'm being insulted and disrespected and should I be calm in such situations?,"Yesterday I was talking to this store clerk in front of my college and we were debating about something and this guy came in(2nd year, junior), involved himself in our conversation and when I countered his points and he had nothing to say so he started using foul language and said some pretty bad stuff to me. The store clerk calmed him down and sent him off. Now I didn't do anything to him. Generally I would have done something to him since I have a past of not being so calm and composed in such situations. 

So after I left from there I keep thinking about why I didn't do anything and what should I do, and I can't think of anything instead of just hurting him. I feel disrespected and angry at myself for not reacting at that moment. This was the first time anyone has been so disrespectful to me and I didn't do anything. I wonder what should I do in such situations? Should I be calm as I was but then I can't take this off my mind I keep thinking about it all day, or should I just hurt him so I feel satisfied and get my respect back. From what I know stoicism is about not being emotional and composed at all times. So please tell me what is the best thing to do in such situations?

Is the heroic masculine purpose equivalent to the pursuit of Stoic moral virtue?,"I just watched this video below and I cannot not see that there is a connection between the heroic masculine purpose themed in this deconstruction and the desire to live by Stoic virtues. Is there a connection? Are they the same thing? Is the heroic masculine purpose a real thing, and if so is there a place for it in Stoicism?

Part of the draw of Stoicism for me is, the desire to live a virtuous life. It oozes purpose. And to see that it permeates the idea of the masculine hero  in our popular culture shows that stoicism is mainstream yet undefined as such or masquerading as a hero's journey.

More into dating / hooking up, tend to be from a wealthier background ( i go to a private school so this isn’t that uncommon ), and people that go out a lot more than i do. I like being friends with extroverts ofc but i can’t really see myself being in a relationship with one i want someone more lowkey hell i’d say i would prefer to date a girl that likes to take things slowly i really need time to build trust. I feel like a lot of these extroverted people are more mature in a way which I’m probably wrong about but i don’t care which isn’t a relationship dynamic i like. I just want to know how you find quiet but also not straight up weird girls because i know their out their.

He relapsed after 6 months of us being together, and has struggled since. He is a relatively private person, but has opened up to me overtime. I am on the path to becoming an addiction specialist, so I have made sure he knows that relapses are okay, natural, and nothing to be ashamed of. I remind him everyday that there is nothing he could tell me that would make me love him less - as long as he is honest. I know from personal experience that breaking the habit of lying out of shame and guilt is one of the most difficult habits to break. I know he most likely wont tell me the truth the first of even second time I ask, but I tell him to give himself time and think before he responds. As long as he eventually tells me the truth, he will be met with love and support, as I will only get angry if he gaslights and continues to lie. He has improved so much over time, but I know it will take much longer before he is comfortable enough to come to me without prompt. Recently I have realized he will tell me only part of the truth, but the part he tells me (after I ask) is enough to make me stop. I always know when something is happening, my gut is rarely wrong. He is currently tapering, but continues to lie about the smallest details ( I .e, buying a another weed pen behind my back, buying other medications to help taper other than the medications I  am aware of). Recently I have been struggling- to the point where most of the time I feel like Im just existing. He is the love of my life and the most extraordinary, magnificent human being I know.but I  keep wondering if he needs to lose me to see that he cannot make rational decisions when it comes to drugs, and that he cant do it alone. He is adamant that he can be logical and rational on this topic, and ultimately shuts me out, even after saying he ""takes my advice and opinions into consideration"". He is working so hard, but is still hiding things from me. It is killing me that he doesn't feel comfortable enough to trust me and be vulnerable to share things he has hidden his entire life. I just dont know what to do or how to cope on my end. I feel the constant pain of betrayal, fear, and heartbreak for him and what he is going through. I need advice on how to get through this without completely falling apart. I feel alone, invisible, and just...unbearable hurt. I  am in therapy but I feel I  need more.

>Ah, the concept of the parts of a whole! How often do we forget the ways in which we are all interconnected, each playing a crucial role in the grand tapestry of existence. Just as the fingers on a hand are separate, yet together form a single entity capable of great feats, so too are we all separate individuals, yet united in our common humanity. And just as the loss of a single finger can render the hand incomplete, so too can our separation from one another lead to a diminished sense of self and a loss of our full potential. Consider the example of the mice gathering cheese in the field. At first, each mouse is focused solely on their own desires, hoarding their cheese and disregarding the needs of their fellow mice. But as they begin to work together, sharing their pieces of cheese and helping one another, they are able to accomplish much more than they ever could have on their own. This is true not only for mice and cheese, but for all of us as humans. When we come together, united in our common goals and desires, we are able to accomplish great things that would have been impossible alone. But despite this, we too often let our petty differences and divisions keep us apart. We fight and bicker over matters of race, religion, and nationalism, forgetting that we are all part of the same great whole. In much the same way, when a single part of the body becomes separated from the rest, it is unable to function as it was intended, and the entire body is diminished. So too can our separation from one another lead to a diminished sense of self and a loss of our full potential.
And thus, let us remember that to be separated from man is to be separated from self. For just as the individual parts of a machine must work together in harmony to accomplish their purpose, so too must we strive to come together as one, recognizing the ways in which we are all interconnected and the essential role that each of us plays in the larger human experience. So let us put aside our differences and embrace our common humanity, for in doing so, we will find not only a sense of unity and belonging, but a greater sense of purpose and meaning in our lives. And let us remember always that we are not separate entities, but rather, we are all essential parts of a single, glorious whole",Stoicism,1675239867.0,t3_10qocl8,0.38,0

Would you do anything with someone who ignored your texts?,"

Assume this is the scenario. You find out someone was ignoring your texts because secretly they think you’re stupid, worthless, and/or want to demonstrate superiority to you.  Psychologically that is what they would be displaying and trying to appear as if the ignoring is done intentionally and they didn’t genuinely forget or get busy etc. 

Theres lots of online dating coaches advising people to do stuff like this too in order to get the other person to “chase”. So what you have in modern times is literally, a bunch of ugly guys and girls, who, might be secretly obsessed with someone, and then intentionally do things like ignore them thinking it will create attraction.

Now if you look into it, this behavior of ignoring people, being unavailable to respond etc, is something that was adapted and modelled after high value people, kings, royalty and celebrities.  Someone whos rich or powerful or otherwise has an interesting or busy life, is likely not gonna be available to reply over texts or emails much. They’ll be so successful or rich or busy they won’t have much free time.

So, being unavailable on text, can give the impression the person is successful, busy, rich, interesting life.  But it can also give the impression of superiority, like they’re too busy for you, dont have time for you, etc. 


What these nutcases in modern times are confused about, however, is that you cant create attraction magically. You have all these nutcases with no lives, no job, who literally are sitting around on phones and computers all day, but who are intentionally ignoring or delaying responses.

So they’re not actually busy or successful or rich or famous, but essentially attempting to fake being so. There’s literally dating coaches advising people to do this to give the impression of being unavailable busy and perhaps “superior”.   Those dating coaches not being in prison is also just one more symptom of the moral failure of modern times. 

So anyway, what if you were physically attracted to someone but then they’re telling you they’re too busy for you, superior to you and etc.

Would you ever do anything with that person? Wouldn’t it be making you look bad? I mean imagine if they told you (subtly) that you’re dumb inferior and worthless, and then a week later or weeks later wanted to have sex with you.

Would you actually feel good about yourself being in a relationship or having sex with someone who basically told you you’re dumb worthless and inferior? Like they’re doing you a favor by having sex with you or dating you?

If someone on the street verbally insults you or acts snobby with you, at minimum, you’d avoid that person at all cost right?  You may even insult them back if they were particularly annoying or kept coming up to you insulting you right?

So why would anyone then get into a relationship with someone who tells them they’re worthless inferior and stupid?  I would never do anything with someone who did that. We couldn’t be friends, we couldn’t be partners. In fact the only thing i could do is use the person as a verbal punching bag. This works especially well if you’ve known the person a while and know what their insecurities or weaknesses are. But make sure you only insult their morals or behavior dont insult their race or physical appearance gender etc. you can insult their behavior and morals religious and political views.   In most cases, the person will want to leave you and tell you not to contact them. And you essentially won. They told you they feel they’re superior and you’re worthless. You told them to take a hike and get a better upbringing.

I would never refer to myself as superior to someone else unless I had better morals.  In the modern world, every other person seems to be referring to themselves as superior. 

This tactic of ignoring texts can be especially brutal and insidious because you should give people some benefit of the doubt. It takes time and deduction to truly confirm if someone was intentionally ignoring you to subtly tell you they’re superior and you’re inferior and stupid, or if they genuinely forgot somehow or are bad at texting or super busy demanding job etc. 

Because it takes time to figure out, it means they might have successfully ignored your text message maybe 5, 10, or 15 times.  So if you then confirm at the 15th time that the whole time they were ignoring you, they were telling you youre inferior and worthless and stupid, it really makes you look bad. Because you continued to maintain a relationship or friendship with someone who was essentially insulting you the whole time.   Isnt it kind of embarrassing?  You basically stayed friends or partners with someone who repeatedly week after week told you you’re worthless?

The good news, though, is the longer youve known them, the more you know about their moral and behavioral issues, insecurities, and weaknesses.  So what exactly would the rational, moral person do, upon figuring out someone insulted you 15 times?  Somone insults you once, you can walk away and end things immediately.

But someone insults you 15 times, and you only realized it at the 15th time because their insults were so insidious and subtle?  Then you have to do anything you can to mentally destroy them, and then completely break off the connection.  They insulted you, and you stayed in the relationship or friendship. So now you need to insult them, until they leave the friendship or relationship and tell you to not contact them etc.",Stoicism,1658495162.0,t3_w5a6gr,0.41,0
Should I have children?,"Considering our ever growing population, would it be virtuous to not have children and instead foster/adopt? Creating new life also gives potential for the baby to be born with illnesses, defects, causing more suffering. Whereas adopting a child who is already here would most likely reduce suffering if you provide them with a stable and caring household. Resources should also be taken into account, creating a new life adds another entire individual to the world, who will need to consume to survive. 

I would like to have my own children one day, I'm sure many people do, but isn't that just a preference determined by biology? I could still experience raising a child through adoption, this seems to be the better option considering the potential suffering caused by creating new life. Is the desire to have my own kids just selfish, considering the only difference between that and adoption is my personal preference?",Stoicism,1638233871.0,t3_r5akbx,0.53,1
Stoics Opinions on beards. How to combat the struggle of parents wanting their child to shave his beard.,"In *How to think like a Roman Empereor* by Donald Roberston a line that stuck out for me was: ""Epictetus  had  defiantly  exclaimed that if the authorities wanted to cut off his beard, they’d have to cut off his  
head first""(pg. 102). 

I related this to my own experience with growing a beard. Because of my brown skin complexion, I often look like a Muslim with a grown out beard. Parents and elders in my life have exclaimed how dirty and similar it makes me look like a Muslim. For most of my life, being at the mercy of my parents in this capitalist society I usually shave it when it starts causing too many issues as I am indifferent truly. Of course, I love my beard.

&#x200B;

 ""*Neither should the beard be cut from the chin (for it is not superfluous), but it too has been provided for us by nature as a kind of cover or protection. Moreover, the beard is nature’s symbol of the male just as is the crest of the cock and the mane of the lion; so one ought to remove the growth of hair that becomes burdensome, but nothing of the beard; for the beard is no burden so long as the body is healthy and not afflicted with any disease for which it is necessary to cut the hair from the chin.* ""  *— Musonius Rufus, Lecture XXI* 

&#x200B;

I'm wondering what other members of the modern Stoic community feel towards being forced to shave their beard. I'm wondering at what lengths I should go to stand my ground.",Stoicism,1631406778.0,t3_pmipug,0.65,5
What are you? Stoic or Sophist?,"It has come to my attention that plenty of people claim to be stoic or claim to know about Stoicism by just reading Marcus Aurelius ,Seneca or Epictetus. 
They claim that they have mastered the arts of ""Stoicism"" just by reading a few quotes on the internet or they claim they fully comprehend it. 
This my brothers is nothing but Sophism. A claim that wants to be read as truth.

My first steps into philosophy and into Stoicism was the same , I thought "" What a wonderful world"" and started doing the stoic exercises, I started reading Marcus Aurelius (my favorite philosopher btw) and started watching youtube videos about stoic practices. But just like any other placebo , it doesnt hold for too long. 

Stoicism suggests for you to live on a philosophy manner , what i dont see from people is this. They just want the placebo that comes with Stoicism,  placebos that if you dont know what youre talking about it wont work out for you.

Seneca,Cinion, Aurelius, Epicteto what they all have in common , that before calling themselves ""Stoics"" they are philosophers they have study philosophy,  metaphysics,  mathematics, philosophy of science,  cynicism. They all studied the philosophers before Stoics , Aristotle, Plato, Socrates,  presocrates , Diogenes. All the philosophy before Stoicism.  They truly knew what Ethics was all about and the problem I see with this new so called NeoStoics is that non of them seem to have critical thinking which is a virtue , they claim they know how the virtues work without knowing how ethics,  metaphysics works first . 

They want to be Stoic but dont seem to be philosophers first , and the illusion of people who thinks they're Stoic it completely breaks into pieces. Just as in neobudhism where people claimed to know about the practices of buddhism because they ""meditate"" or are more ""mindfulness"" it does not hold you have if you have not question the world we live in ,how it works , and why it works the way it do , meditation is not gonna save from the mental illness of capitalism or a bad government does to you and this is what is happening to Stoicism as well , people are using as a religion. They are relying on it ,not any different then what a Christian would do .

My point is , you want to call yourself a stoic ok , just be aware that before the real Stoics called themselves like that they study philosophy, mathematics, science, astrophysics and plenty of more fields , and went through years and years studying before they were able to fully comprehend the world around them. 
This is what Neo Stoics don't do and it is fundamental if one wants to be called stoic . Read what philosophy came after Stoicism,  read about psychology, about astronomy, about science,  develop critical thinking, develop your virtues but before developing virtues read the classic so that you know what they meant by virtues.

Don't cage yourself only on Stoicism by  predicting as if you were a philosopher , repeating quotes of Stoics , this is what differentiate philosophy from shopism.",Stoicism,1625514767.0,t3_oeexit,0.41,0

"Wait, is Stoicism just Christianity minus the mythology and dogma?","Christian ethics seem pretty similar to Stoic ethics. I think what happened is that the entire Greece-Roman world (at least for the educated types) in the medeterainian adopted a similar ethical system and this became absorbed into Christianity while stoicism became forgotten. A lot of early Christians were Neo-Platonists and Stoics and the transition from those views to Christianity would have not been that large. A lot of people look at Rome and see this huge gulf between the polytheism and Christianity and can't see how the change happened, but if you start to look at the philosophies you see them as a bridge.

So that means Stoicism might be a kind of Christianity-lite but minus the rituals, mythology and specific dogma. Christian ethics without the Christianity.

The connection between Greco-Roman mythology and Christianity is well documented but I've not seen anyone talk of the philosophical similarities which seem obvious to me.

Edit: This books seems to argue just what I'm observing.

Is there any true stoic whose writings survived other than Epictetus? I know that Panaetius was copied in De Officiis, but he was also not of the same branch of stoicism as Epictetus, that of Diogenes, instead of the elite who for some bizzare reason always seem to endup doing exactly the opposite of what they preach ( Cicero's son didnt turn out to be much either).",Stoicism,1571689059.0,t3_dl697v,0.4,0
Calling in sick?,"I wonder how the practicing stoics among you handle the following situation: You need to go to work but you also need to go. You will miss the bus and only get there by noon. You have important meetings.

Diogenes defecated in public. I don't believe he did it to offend people. Duties and the will to perform a duty are under one's control, while this painful urge and the relief from it are not. Hence it follows that one should very much defecate in public if locating a bathroom means neglecting a duty.

However, one could argue that the duty to not offend people is perhaps more important than the duty of keeping your work hours.

Have you ever thought of this? What do you do? Do you give way to the external impression of needing to have a bowel movement?

The same goes for calling in sick for any other reason. And btw this is a very serious question. Thank you, Thomas",Stoicism,1569059510.0,t3_d78ixp,0.4,0

For it were better to die of hunger, exempt from grief and fear, than to live in affluence with perturbation; and it is better that your servant should be bad than you unhappy.

Begin therefore with little things. Is a little oil spilt or a little wine stolen? Say to yourself, ""This is the price paid for peace and tranquillity; and nothing is to be had for nothing.""

How does Stoicism reconcile the fact that Marcus Aurelius was known to regularly use Opium?,"*edit*

People seem to be very quick to play the ""We're all human"" card.

Fair enough.

The reason I asked this question is because from personal experience I can say that using mind-altering substances has an indisputable impact not only on one's cognitive ability, but on their ability to process and act upon logical parameters, such as Stoicism. 

ie. its very easy to be accepting, calm and rational, when you are aided by drugs. It is easier to overcome many of the drives, urges, inhibitions and other limitations as a result. 

As such I wonder if it perhaps changes things, with regards to Aurelius and Stoicism. 

No I don't judge him, or anyone, for using substances, especially if they promote wellness, mental or physical. However it is naive to think that they did not have an influence, either on his perspective (and by proxy, teachings) or on his ability to live what he preached.

This Is *Literally* A Self Help Forum At This Point.,"After joining her months ago, I soon realized this was not really a place to discuss stoicism, but more so a place for people to ventabout their issues, and ask the question ""How would a stoic deal with situation X?"" with various different situations. Why is this the go to thought process when people think of stoicism, that it is a self help strategy? I went ahead and counted all the posts that were simply asking for help on things sorting by new right now. After 48/50 of the most recent posts where nothing more than asking help on how to deal with situations, I knew for sure that I was seeing the situation correctly, and I wasn't just noticing the bad posts standing out from the good. Do you guys like it to be a self help forum? Would you rather have it be this way than actually furthering your understanding of stoicism? I absolutely love stoicism &amp;amp; philosophy as a whole, But this sub has become.. insufferable. R/philosophy only has posts about furthering your philosohical knowledge. R/askphilosophy doesn't have 1000 questions asking how to deal with some of the most trival ""problems"" on the planet. Why here? To those of you who have actually dug into stoic readings, and provide geniune insight, you're wonderful. But to those of you who come here to ask questions like ""My girlfriend broke up with me &amp;amp; is making our friends choose between us, how can I ever manage? This is seems like the end of the road for me."" because you've seen a Marcus Aurelius quote on instagram...  know you're bringing shame upon the whole forum. Until later r/stoicism.

"Not sure what the point of this post is, maybe just to get things off my mind."," 

Im a 20-year-old guy who recently wrapped up my gap year with a lot of hard work. Despite earning good money, I didn't save any. I spent it on a car and started but never finished my driving license. Now, the car sits unused, and another insurance payment is coming up.

Most of my earnings went into partying and, unfortunately, drugs. Thankfully, I've kicked that habit and don't feel the urge anymore—except when I drink, which is rare now. I've started university but missed three months of classes. I want to contact university about my situation but im scared they will kick me out for not doing any work at all. I like my course and the topics, but I can't bring myself to engage. I label myself as lazy, but when I attempt something, I can't seem to enjoy it.

While I hesitate to say I'm depressed, I feel lost. I enjoy life, people, even the ""bad"" ones, but I struggle to like myself or work on self-improvement. I have a wonderful girlfriend, and I know I'm smart, but when things start improving, I feel out of place, and they take a downturn again.

Two years ago, I lost my dad to alcohol, went through a breakup, and lost a friend, all in one year. Looking back, that seems to be when things started spiraling, and im not looking for an excuse, i cannot control that. 

I often compare myself to my successful sister, measuring my worth by materialistic standards, despite knowing it's not a healthy approach.

Today, my MacBook screen broke, adding to my stress as repairs will strain my already dead budget, but life continues with or with out. I'm not sure if this post even makes sense, but I felt the need to write and seek constructive criticism or just an understanding ear. It's strange—I know what I need to do, but I'm just not doing it. I'm trying, but it's all so confusing. This may sound like a cry for help, and I'm aware of that. I appreciate stoicism and the people here, and I just wanted to unload my thoughts.

If most of this doesnt make sense, dont worry, it doesnt in my head also.

Being partner to someone with a chronic health issue,"Hello. My wife has Type 2 Diabetes and I find it so hard sometimes to keep myself steady. Stoicism teaches us how to bear most things and when it comes to health, its bearing your own health, better or worse. I find it much harder to deal with the sickness of my wife though. She suffers from anxiety and depression along with a couple year old Type 2 Diabetes diagnoses. I am so worried that she is not strong enough to do what is right for herself and that relatively soon our situation in life will be quite dire. At this point she can still work, but has so many days of just not feeling good, physical or mental.

I know so much of what she has to do is out of my control totally and all I can really do is cheer from the sidelines. What happens to her affects me in SO many ways. My emotions and feelings are one thing, but just the quality of life her health lowers upon both our shoulders is immense. The future will likely only be worse. As a Stoic it is my duty to look at life and imagine the things that will happen to be better prepared. That is very hard when I consider the goals and things we wanted to do in life. 

So I know it isn't cancer and I know its something that should be managed better and I also know I can't make her and I know as a couple we will be sad the whole time dealing with it.

But if the same character insists on telling the truth when a lie would save his life,then we sense that honesty is at the core of his nature""_Robert McKee,Story

In an episode of Boston Legal I saw many years ago, Alan Shore (James Spader) is in the early days of a relationship with a female Judge who tells him that it’s ok if he’s attracted to other women. As long as he channels that attraction to her instead of to them. Taking her at her word, he starts physically flirting with her as he admits he was attracted to another woman. Angry, she pulls away and tells him not to touch her and doesn’t want to speak to him. He goes to sleep wondering what just happened.


Confused, Alan talks about it the next day with Denny Crane (William Shatner), who tells him, “The key to any good relationship is lying. You tell her she’s the only one you find attractive, the only girl you wanna sleep with, the only one you really wanna spend time with. All kinds of garbage they can’t possibly believe. Women count on us to lie to them. How else can they convince themselves that they still look young if we don’t help?”

So the next time Alan sees her, he asks:
Alan Shore: Just so I’m clear… if I’m ever even slightly attracted to another woman, I should just lie about that?
Judge Gloria Weldon: Through your teeth.
Alan Shore: Hm. Really? Why would you tolerate dishonesty from your partner?
Judge Gloria Weldon: I wouldn’t. If I ever catch you lying to me, it’s over.
Alan Shore: But you just…
Judge Gloria Weldon: No. It’s very simple, Alan. When you tell me that you’re not attracted to anybody else but me, it needs to be the truth.
Alan taps his fingers as he lets this sink in.

I feel like judge gloria in that last bit was echoing Epictetus(Discourses 3.7): ""..no woman ought to seem beautiful to you except your own wife....""

And while what Epictetus teaches here is practical and doable, I don't think fidelity and honesty are considered as valuable in the society I live in.To me, drama and being cheated on are far more valuable to the women in my society. Perhaps it's the same thing Seneca meant in on benefits by ""Men Nowadays nolonger secretly, but openly outrage the wives of others...no one takes a wife unless he takes her away from someone else..Soon adultery becomes the most respectable form of marriage..."". William Law while making an argument for the dignity and intelligence of women while overlooking whatever flaws they may posses wrote ""they are often too ready to receive the first fops, beaux, and fine dancers for their husbands, it is no wonder they should like that in men which they have been taught to admire in themselves.""",Stoicism,1697054702.0,t3_175ngfc,0.5,0

Personally, I’d shoot the innocent man to save the 20 a catholic friend of mine said that wouldn't be a very stoic thing to do. 

From my perspective, pulling the trigger is no different than being the reason the 20 men didn't get nutrition resulting in their deaths. Is it not just to do what you can to save the most people?",Stoicism,1692562126.0,t3_15wlhoc,0.5,0
How to stop overthinking and start living in the present?,"22M who just graduated from college.

I am going through the phase of overthinking right now which makes me feel depressed. I have trouble sleeping at night, wherein when I wake up to take a sip of water or use the restroom, I have trouble sleeping back since my thoughts keep wandering and focus on the negative elements of life or comparing my life with others in a few cases.

Even when I go outside to roam/travel my negative thoughts don't seem to take a break and affect time living in the moment. I am where I wanted to be when I was younger which is a major thing I thank myself for for not giving up and working hard. One of the factors I feel is that I  distanced myself from my college friend with whom I made many memories and hoped we would be lifelong friends, but I couldn't since he moved to a new friend group where I didn't feel valued and honestly, it wasn't the ideal friend group I wanted so I left. The distancing part was probably the most tragic experience I have had till now since I would have a few dreams now and then where he was enjoying himself with his new friends(and mocking me a few times), and I was a lonely guy who was in the final year of college without any friends. I have moved on, but I  guess my mental state hasn't. It has been around a year since this happened and tbh I haven't really enjoyed living/been truly happy since then. Since then, I tried mingling with a couple of new friend groups but am probably being used there so I distanced myself from them again too.

The above-mentioned experiences have made me mature and better at people reading but also resulted in me overthinking.  
I  am very concerned about this and don't want this to affect my mental health in the future. We all know this age is the prime where our mind settles and I don't want my overthinking at this stage to affect and put me in a bad mental state affecting my life and dependents in the long run.

Any tips/bits of advice are welcome. TIA :)

Reconciling Stoic virtues while remaining safe,"During the early hours of a summer morning I was taking a tram back home when I noticed what looked to be like a timid girl in her late teens take a seat two rows ahead of me. After a couple of stops a guy dressed in a typical roadman outfit that was around the same age as her came in through the entrance door behind me, scanned the tram  from front to back and rapidly approached the young woman. 

As soon as he was facing her he slapped her really hard and grabbed her by the throat and shook her from side to side repeatedly while yelling extremely loudly in a Middle Eastern language. 

I was reading a book right before this happened and once it started I was in complete shock. Since I knew there was no one else around (there was only an old lady in the tram who appeared to have just come back from a long camping trip with a big backpack), I knew it was my responsibility to protect the poor girl. I put my book in my bag and got up to try to deescalate the situation but I noticed there was a large bulge on the side of his pants that looked awfully similar to the case of a machete (it is EXTREMELY common for these kind of roadmen to have knives on them). I suppose I only took notice of this then since I had gotten up and was about to act, so my brain did a thorough check on the guy before I did so. Whether this was actually there or was simply a byproduct of fear / adrenaline, coupled with the fact I could not focus over the loud screaming on his part, I don't know. 

All I knew is that I had to help this girl, all that happened is that I cowardly left the tram and left her behind like a vermin. I called the police and explained the situation and I also called the public transport company to report the incident. However the realistic side of me knows this did no difference. 

The values that I hold, and the values held by stoicism, detail I should act justly, with courage and honor. But my actions that morning were the complete opposite. 

A part of me wishes I would have tried to deescalate anyways, to let my head lead instead of my heart. This implies that I should risk the possibility of death if that is what it takes to act in accordance to my beliefs. 

The other part, however, tells me I should “Be real”. And that I should not risk dying for this. 

I honestly regret what I did, although a year has passed I still think about it and I often think: “If I was given a chance to redeem myself in the near future with similar circumstances, would I take the risk this time?” 

I feel like an absolute coward, a hypocrite who does not stand for what he believes in. I have trained bjj and muay thai for years but the variable of a knife having been added to the equation was too much for me at the time. 

When should you value your safety more than your belief system? One can argue that if you don't prove your beliefs through actions, you don't really believe in them at all. What do you all think?",Stoicism,1692342084.0,t3_15ud1o1,0.5,0

Justice,"  Humanity talks about justice all the time, but justice for who? The thief should be arrested for stealing, but why he steals doesn't matter, no matter what his motivation is. Whether it's greed or education, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if it's for sheer survival or for personal gain. In the eyes of the law, there are always only two roles: perpetrator and victim.  This coldness of the system is always there because man is incapable of drawing boundaries. Who is to blame? The system is to blame because one grows up in wealth and the other in poverty. Or at least, from the beginning of human nature, that one's own well-being is placed above the well-being of others. Due to these ambiguities, one can always justify everything in one's own sense, dragging one's happiness down.

How to Increase Pain Tolerance Level? (Physical and Mental),"I'll begin with this quote

>Life is a tragedy to those who feel and a comedy to those who think - Jean Racine.

2 years ago, I was sitting at rock bottom. I was 14 and I always only felt things emotionally and never took anything to thought consideration. It was only after I found stoicism where it felt like I actually felt that I was living a life. I only existed all the time (never had an average middle class life) but it was only in the last year where I felt like I found some holy truth.

Like I said, I've always saw things up close. I only felt and reacted. I never thought about it. Feelings only worsen the pain that I had with my problems. 

So I embarked on a journey to reduce the emotions I felt with my problems and to find a way to take it in stoically.

Here's what I've learned:

\- There's no mental suffering. You can never suffer from any kind of mental disease (except if it has to do with your physical brain). ""You have power over your mind, not outside events. Realize this and you'll find strength"". In order to increase your mental pain tolerance level, you just need to see it objectively. If that's not enough, change the way you see it. There's no way to decrease your mental pain suffering than to realize that it's just your perception and your own coloring on it. Just face the hard truth and realize you are immune to it. Assume you have the ability to take in any harsh truth and just take it in bluntly. Trust me, if you know and realize you've the ability to intake the truth, you've already solved the problem. ""The Giant outside you is never bigger than the god inside you"".

\- Physical pain tolerance is necessary. You've to train yourself to your maximum extent. You have to feel the physical pain flow through your entire body. It enables your mind to have a choice: feel it like a layman or use it as an opportunity. Everyone feels pain, but it's how about how you feel it that dictates your growth in the future. This has correlation with the strength of your mind. Every time you're about to feel a pain is an opportunity or a level in a game, To prove to yourself if you do indeed have what it takes (god has already given you), You just need to acknowledge the strength. 

\- Going to gym isn't enough. I see people go to gym and says they have fun in having pain. No, You're having dopamine, you're not having pain. Yes, You might be growing your muscle but there's no point in calling it a pain if there's comfort involved in doing it. See our body can enjoy physical pain, it can even spark dopamine. Do the things you never feel like doing it. The exact time your brains says you can't do something or you don't feel like it, that's exactly when you have to fucking do it.

\- It's only constant intake and contact with pain that can make you feel as a stoic. Do everyday something that makes you feel uncomfortable. Put a calendar on your wall and tick off everyday you feel discomfort. Change is possible, only if you will it to be.

Is prudence actually a good thing?,"The term Prudence refers to one reserving some actions or opinions based on circunstances.

Stoicism and identity (I feel like a freak),"This post is about something somewhat uncommon, at least from my knowledge, so please bear with me. For context, I'm a 19 year old female. I will also add that I'm in therapy, but even therapy can give me answers that aren't helpful or objective. It's a challenging situation partly because this sort of thing has been highly politicized. 

I find myself in a strange place. For about two or three years now, I've experienced whatever the non-trans equivalent is to gender dysphoria, particularly around my chest. I've thought about it and I know I'm not trans, but I am more masculine, at least in the way I dress. I also came to realize that I'm very likely gay. 

The problem is that this is somewhat new, and both me and my therapist are confident it stems from trauma, at least in part. It wasn't of a sexual nature, but somehow it seemed to really mess with my identity. Either that or I'm simply growing up and have had the opportunity to find my personality after being intensely sheltered as a kid.

I began to value strength and capability above all else. I began to care about being a good and honorable person. I started taking martial arts classes and going to the gym, hobbies I've kept up and have been very consistent with for three years. Yet, I also began to hate being a woman. I hated being weaker, I hated being seen a certain way and sexualized (especially because I'm pretty much devoid of sexual desire), I hated having biology that I knew I wouldn't use, biology that limited me physically. I was often the only woman in my martial arts gym, and the guys would go easy on me and turn around and wail on each other. I wanted that ferocity. Martial arts and the gym (among other smaller hobbies) had pretty much become my identity and I had met amazing people through them, yet they began to contribute to this disdain of my womanhood. 

I came to accept most of these things over time, knowing that there wasn't much I could do about them. I didn't want to be a man, so there was no use in hormones. I resolved to do what I could, getting as strong as I could personally be and becoming as skilled as I personally could. I resigned to play the cards I was dealt, operating within my own capabilities instead of wishing I had someone else's. 

Still, this sort of split in my identity lingered. Femininity was something I abandoned when I started dressing myself and buying my own clothes. I spent most of my time in the gym building my upper body. I shoved these feelings to the side until they came back to bite me even harder. I didn't like having the body I had. I hated having breasts. I began to fall into depression until I realized that whatever I was doing wasn't helping me in the long run. I was distracting myself, chasing this ever moving goalpost hoping that one day I'd just be happy with myself. I took my first ever voluntary hiatus from martial arts after attending nearly every day for three years with the plan to work through whatever I was running from. 

That was nearly three weeks ago, I think. I opened up to my therapist about my struggles, as I had kept most of them to myself the entire time we had been meeting. I told them about the extreme discomfort around my chest and that I was considering top surgery. They were encouraging, agreeing that I had a very long time to make my decision as I have to save up the money to pay out of pocket. 

For the first time in a while, I felt true hope. I felt that if I could get surgery, I would be much more free. I never liked my breasts and have spent a very long time covering them up nearly 24/7. I thought about how nice it would feel physically not to have them, to simply take my shirt off at night to sleep or go out in the rain and feel the air and raindrops on my shoulders and back. I thought about getting out of the shower and wrapping a towel around my waist, not having to put something over my chest almost instantly. The freedom I'd feel not having to cover them up, but to simply throw a shirt on and go about my day. People wouldn't be as awkward about trying not to hit my breasts in training. If I ended up in a relationship, I wouldn't have to worry about covering them and asking my partner to ignore them. I could wear tighter shirts. I could feel the world more closely without having two annoying blobs on my chest moving around. If I could just rid myself of breasts, I would be alright with who I am. I could simply live as a woman without breasts. I could be who I am, not worrying about politics or special labels. 

Yet, I feel like a freak. To many, this is self-mutilation. It is arguably not stoic, as I should be content with the body I have, or at least accept it and be grateful that I have a relatively healthy body. Sometimes I feel like it would be the thing that frees me, other times I feel insane, like even considering such a thing makes me mentally ill and unworthy of respect and love. It would isolate me even more, especially where I live. 

I haven't slept well in these weeks. My mind has been racing with possibilities and thoughts and emotions. I would be hard pressed to find a therapist who isn't pressured to agree with me, or I'd find someone on the complete opposite end of the spectrum. My family doesn't know about this or my being gay. I feel like I'm wearing a mask, hiding the face of something ugly and strange. 

I don't know what to do. ",Stoicism,1687484961.0,t3_14glkjr,0.5,0

I think this is a great reminder to not expect people to act like you want them to act but just accept and recognise they are external to you and that you can't control the actions of other people. It doesn't mean you can't trust people, you even have to find friends you can fully trust for example but it still doesn't mean they are in your control, they aren't and they are still human beings and human beings can make mistakes. So don't be upset or surprised if someone betrays you, just accept, it's okay to feel sad but don't get overwhelmed by what you feel and always respond to people's actions in a virtuous way.

Stoic gratitude for endurance and self control,"The last couple of months I have been more vigorously than before applying my stoic and other philosophical principles to my everyday life. It amazes me constantly how effortless it really is when one truly believes in it and instead has it as a constant motivation instead of falling victim to irrational urges!

Yesterday I attended a quite intense cross-fit (that’s the best word for it) class at my collage (also the best word for the international basis, i’m a “teacher assistant” at something called a folk high school). 

I started out thinking I might take it easy as I was already quite sore from only one rest day and otherwise intense exercise the previous week. But, as I started out, the excitement, enthusiasm and vigour for perseverance and endurance came to me. I realise now that it was a bit excessive, harmful and certainly NOT stoic perfection, then, but I wanted to try and see if I really could use my mind to overcome something a bit extreme, as stoicism says one can. I also must admit that I sort of got carried away thinking about what it would be like had I been a soldier of Rome of maximum virtue. The imagination is truly wonderful :)

So, throughout I never ceased my intensity at every station (we did intervals w rotations to different stations). And pushed myself beyond what I have ever known before. My muscles were sending profound signals of pain to my brain, and it was very painful at moments, but I never gave in. My willpower and self control triumphed simply because I believed it would.

I’ve had similar experiences before, and definitely lately as I’ve been more conscious of it, but not on this level before. So I am immensely thankful to the stoics who came before who I have learnt so much from!

Separation between work and worker: Useful for the Ryan Holiday debate,"I know we see the 'Ryan Holiday debate' pretty often here, so I thought I'd start a new thread engaging with an important distinction I don't often see engaged with, separating the work and the feelings we have about the worker.

You may find Holiday's brand off-putting, and it's sales-focused nature to be against the ideals of stoicisim. That the lessons might misinterpret the core concepts of stoicism, even if only by omission.

Try to engage with the actual, direct statements made by Holiday or the Daily Stoic brand. Ask good questions. Unpack what implications or assumptions are in those statements. That discourse only helps you and other stoics explore and practice these concepts.

**Don't get upset on behalf of Stoicism!** Whether or not Holiday / Daily Stoic *should* be prominent in stoicism isn't worth debating. It's already happened.

And if you came in through the Daily Stoic (as many do), and if you still find value in the books and emails and podcasts produced by that brand, that is also okay.

Someone critiquing the brand today aren't demanding to retroactively remove the positive experiences you've had. So if a critique is happening, it's not worth pointing out that the Daily Stoic was your entry point, that you have gratitude for that, as a way to suggest that the critique isn't valid. Your positive memory isn't being attacked, a fellow philosopher is being debated.

**Don't get upset on behalf of Holiday / Daily Stoic!** He and they are more than capable of defending their own work, if they choose to.

Survival/Hardcore Minecraft forces me to use Stoicism,"Yeah, it sounds very silly but currently I'm not passing through much pain or crysis in real life, I'm mostly calm and relaxed when I'm at job and I'd consider that I'm happy doing my thing. But when I get to play Minecraft Survival or Hardcore, I'm surprised myself when I discover that I'm very annoyed and I do mumble, to the point of even hitting my own leg, when I die and lose all of my things suddenly.

Usually I tend to rationalize everything in the sense that all of my stuff can be lost or will be lost, that even if I progress a lot, tomorrow I will lose my most precious stuff such as enchanted armor and, that's not a bad thing because that's how the game is meant to be, and it's just a game. It happened that even if I had a lot of progress building a house and having the mediums to regenerate what I've lost, I got frustrated to the point of deleting the world and starting again.

Now because of Stoicism I'm less affected by that, but still I need to fight that emotional habit that triggers by itself the exact moment I lost something. If that's so in a game, how would it be in real life?

A thought about the framing of stoicism,"It just occurred to me that, in the public perception, stoicism is often framed in the negative: ""Stoicism teaches that you cannot change most things, so you should focus on what you can change, which is next to nothing."" (exaggeration for emphasis, of course). And I remember that I also kind of phrased it that way sometimes.

But... there is another truth here, right? You CAN change your reactions. You can work on yourself.

Oddly enough, in the mainstream narrative of our culture, it seems that this is largely unknown. People seem to perceive their own reactions as something that ""just happens"". They cannot help but get angry. Romantic love is only valid when it hits you almost against your will, and so on.

"Here's a new, what's the Stoic response to this particular situation?","In a sub reddit I made a joke. The majority of the sub reddit hated me for making the joke. 

What's the stoic response?

1. Leave the sub and never post again

2. Stay in the sub and keep posting because you shouldn't let them change you

The idea of ignoring them is implied for me because I really don't care they didn't like the joke. I just don't know if leaving is best because they're not worth my time, but some say if someone does something you don't like and you distant yourself, you're allowing them to change you so they win. In the same sense you could argue contemplating this is allowing them to change me so that could mean I care and have already been changed by it. 

I'm asking because this dilemma comes up often from me and I want to make sure I act in a way that upkeeps my integrity and doesn't allow outside influences dictate who I am.  

I don't feel like I get my ideas across well, and I'm working on that. So I'll answer question if this doesn't make sense.

What is an effective way to regulate your emotions especially if people take advantage of them to the point where you can no longer feel them since they concider you weak but not expressing any emotions ever kills you and makes you overwhelmed severely angry since you're not allowed to express them?," 

I was always bullied in school and always had problems with anger and crying,it is extremely easy to make me cry, I tried to hide it and hold it in but to no avail, and the insults only got more harsh and harsh so they can laugh at my suffering. The bullying got to the point where I was struck down each time I tried to smile or laugh or tried to not be disconnected and isolated from my peers and tried to play uno or PE with them, only to be commented on and hit with a basketball ball in the face nad then laughed at. I wasn't even concidered human and basically every other girl despite being horrible and manipulative was treated with respect while because they saw me as weird I was dehuminized and treated as less than because I didnt fit the standart of the mean feminine girl, I liked to study while they all cheated and basically they just hated me and took advantage of anything I did since I was afraid of speaking up. This made me feel helpless and suislidal and I developed real muteness, I try to cope by going back into situations and imagining what I want to say to them but honestly they wouldnt have listneed to me anyway, so I get retriggered.

My therapist tries to tell me to ""break up with them"" since they live in my mind rent free and haunt me while they themselves were never punished and never spend a second even thinking about me and I am supposed to either magically move on or forgive but I don't want this to haunt me. I became cold and distant and isolated my self as a result however I do need people, not talking to anyone for a long time made me puke out of anxiety the same way my bullies made me puke just by being near me and hearing their voice. I felt both invisible and hated which is the worst situatuon to be on since no one cares about you much to stand up for you but you somehow stand out enough to be bullied and not accepted anywhere and no one wanted to sit next to you or be near you. I really struggle to be nice and love life and relate to people since I rarely had friends and i DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT WEIRD MEANS, PEOPLE JUST NEVER TELL ME YET IT IS OKAY TO TREAT ME WITH DISRESPECT AND LIKE I AM SUBHUMAN, and I am magically supposed to be confident and cool and make a comeback. What if I dont want to stand up for my self.

What if I can't. What if I never could. Abusing me all the time into submisivness and muteness wouldn't make me learn, telling me to go to martial arts and spending money learning some moves that won't work on the street won't help me move on. I really struggle to not only feel my emotions but express them, since I am an emotional perso nand connect with people through emotions and without them I feel hollow, while these mentally ill people bullied me and terroized me and laughed at my misery just because they have problems probably and don't know how to handle them besides being cruel to someone they dislike which isn't even a valid reason to harass a person, a lot of people don't like me but never bully me, same with me. I am tired of being nice and depending on people's niceness and smiling and being the good girl if al lI get is disrespect, but being mean isn' the solution either, this whole assertiveness thing looks like just being a cold b, and I have no logical idea why people respect that more, it is like I am never allowed to be my self, to be honest, to just express any emotion without being attacked by some jerk or laughed at.

No wonder I became paranoid, insecure and anxoious and was bullied into not giving a damn. I care too much and pushing me to the point where I don't care speaks volumes about how much of a psychopath someone is. I feel like I was really bright, like a light on a candle and they really wanted to break me and succeeded. I mean, who wouldn't have broke when a group of people constantly comment on what they do - WHat is she DOING, WHAT IS SHE DOING, WHAT IS SHE DOING. Why is it so important to you, a person who has social life and friends, what is a person without those things doing. It is like some mystery and they must know what I must do so they can laugh at it, even my breathing and walking. But no. I am maniacal and insane clearly. They wil never care, remember or take responsiblity and will never apologize but honestly I just want an explanation beyond - you're an easy target, stop being an easy target and you won't be bullied, cause like this whole punch the bully is not that much working, especially if you are a girl, and especially if your bullies are hostile boys that threaten to beat you up simply for you DARING to stand up for your self verbally after years of all kinds of abuse. This is why I hate sex. the bullying feels like a methaphor for rape, more like anal rape where my hands are tied and i just take it. And I dont want to have sex with a guy for this reason, it makes me cry to think abou it.

A person who spent her entire life making others happy and ended up miserable didn't deserve to bullied but bullies always somehow rationalize it, even though there is no reason behind their deeds and you are always blamed that you wanted it and should have defneded your self better but when you do, you are either slapped, beaten up, stalked or just told to suck it up and ignore it. Being emotional is part of being a woman, being a human and I get tirggered very easily and a lot of things overwhelm me. Simple hug makes me cry, and I lash out in anger for simple things. I am clearly traumatized but am afraid that my trauma will haunt me for the rest of my life no matter how much I go to a psychologist, for whatever reason people perceive me as weak and attack me unless I act like a emotionless psychopath, but not expressing any emotions hurts me, it makes me feel like drowning. Does anyone of you have any advice about emotional regulation or how to express emotions in a healthy way without being destructive or looking like a crazy 5 year old, because I do act like that because I cant verbalize neither emotions nor what happened to me even though I am out of high school. I just cant move on while everyone else moved on. I hate being watched. i HATE being judged. I hate being disliked or hated.

This is why I was a people pleaser, to avoid abuse. I just want peace nad love. And I don't understand why I must fight constantly for basic respect. Why is it so hard for me to make friends? Why does the male gener dislike me so much? Is it because I am not dumb and hot? So ugly girls deserve to be abused is that it? I really wish I could have spoken up more but I was so suislidal that i just dissociated a lot and was in my own fantasy world in class, too tired to say or do anything or even defend my self. I am still afraid to talk to guys but I do want to date. I just hate how people pick up on stupid things and go - aha, you are weak, we will gang up on you and bully you. I am tired of being vulnerable for simply existing and having human emotions here and there. I really need advice on how to handle this, how to be more here in the now, how to heal, meditation and exercise don't work if you are too overwhelmed. No matter what I do I can't seem to move on and seem mentally stuck in high school, living in purgatory of my own memories which haunt me and make me relive this hell every day, I can't seem to process it no matter how much I think about it, and I am supposed to magically have confidence nad love my self and trust my self and set boundaries when I was mistreated most of my life. People have more severe traumas, like losing parents going to war, and even though my father passed away recently, and I have other traumas, my brain can't process my bullying trauma and it affects me more severely than any other trauma I have.

Disadvantages in being stoic?,"After studying and practicing stoicism for a while I’ve hit a wall in the logic.
Being stoic can be disadvantageous in many situations. 

When pursuing something, being passionate about it will push you farther. Being stoic destroys that passion, because it should be an indifference. For example pursuing higher education loses its meaning, thus crushing the emotional pursuit if it’s put in the preferred indifferences category.

When talking with people, being invested emotionally helps in communication. If we act solely stoically, none of the events they are talking about will mean anything to us. So either we fake being emotionally receptive (good luck on that), or tell them outright it doesn’t matter. Being completely honest destroys potential relations, makes it harder to create a proper network with whom interacting it. Honesty goes in opposition with preferred indifferences.

When adversities come, being emotional brings attention to the obstacles you’re trying to solve. If your car is on fire, and you’re trying to put it out (it is preferable to have a car than not), screaming in honest panic, being agitated will attract people’s attention and you will get help much faster.

When talking with employers, services, acting with emotion will make them pay attention better.
The art to fake being emotional for a preferred indifference is dishonest and not virtuous. Being emotional is useful.

How can you achieve goal without the use of emotions?
Anger can be transferred into useful energy when making tasks.
Sadness can help you empathize.

If you’re in a battlefield, being fearful might save your life. Being scared of the sword makes your head faint the blow. You’re of more use to other people alive than dead. You need fear to survive (preferred indifference, again).

Also, if there is no state of nature (logos, or god), how can virtues be anything else other than potentially useful practices?
Stoicism needs to permeate with “logos” for virtues to be seen as the only good. Otherwise there’s no reason to be moral (if there are, the reasons are “its useful to me” which is egotistical in a sense)

"Day 1 of Stoicism, did well. Day 2 of Stoicism, truth bombs dropped and I feel horrible.","I have always been fascinated by different schools of studies and always knew stoicism to be one of the most practical ones out there. So after a lot of thought, introspection, questioning, and study, after around 5 months, I finally decided to pick up stoicism seriously and implement it in my life. Yesterday, I spent the whole day trying to gain as much knowledge as I can on the topic, making sure that I was as efficient as I can, and not cutting any corners. Today, I started taking action on it, not letting my emotions run rampant, and coming to terms with the existence of misery or social life as a stoic. 

&#x200B;

I also approached the girl that I've liked for the past 7 months and confessed how I felt to her with as much compassion and honesty as I could. As much as she was moved by it, I had to learn the harsh truth that she already has a boyfriend (2 years together). The whiplash of knowing it stayed for a second, but I kept my mind and thought before saying anything irrational as we spent almost an hour talking it out. I stayed as stoic, honest, and indifferent as I could. 

I know there's nothing I can do about this and the final result of what happened is totally out of my control, so I'm trying to let it go. As emotional of a person I am (I cry if I see someone else sad, I'm scared of even the stupidest things), I am proud to say I kept my composure. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

However, now I'm back home it's all slowly creeping in again. The lack of comfort, the feeling of knowing there's no hope, and knowing that there isn't anything I could've done, are making me feel powerless and weak. Stoicism says that I have the power over my mind and I decide how I feel, but I don't think I have. I'm trying to not be sad but sadness still finds its way in. (I'm 18 now, 19 soon, and throughout my 12 years of school and college life, I had never felt even the slightest bit of attraction to anyone till 7 months earlier, to this girl. Maybe it's the intensity of the time or something else but I just can't seem to let it go.) 

&#x200B;

I know this is exactly what Stoicism prepares you for, but I don't feel like I'm doing anything at all. By trying to let go of the feelings, I feel like I'm showing it down a barrel and ignoring it, waiting for it to come out exploding one day. A feeling knowing that no one else may ever come to make me feel safe or comfortable around like she did even if we were just friends, a thorn pushing its way in saying that I'll never be the way I want to be, or seeing her every single day smiling or laughing and thinking that those laughs and smiles could've been with me. None of this is under my control and I am absolutely aware of that. I know I must let them go but I can't seem to figure out how, and it's making me feel even worse than how I would've reacted to all this if I wasn't even following Stoicism and just cried my eyes out

I watch prawn 3 times a week and I want to stop completely. I'm not addicted but I used to be.
It makes me feel like shit. And when I relapse and watch prawn I hate it. 

Any stoic advice relating to addiction and or having discipline with my sexuality.

Stoicism blended with Nihilism,"I believe both philosophies are true in some ways, but I think Stoicism should be a bit more Nihilistic. Most of us agree that we create our own meaning (Nihilism) and things are not good or bad in themselves, it's just our opinions that create what is good and bad AKA virtue and vice (Stoicism.)

But couldn't this concept of Stoicism go a bit further? Shouldn't we try to be as realistic as possible and add ""our opinions"" to what is neither good or bad? Shouldn't we just say everything good and bad is just a human invention? If we do this it seems to downplay the importance of virtue, unless we add some other supporting justification. Maybe we can say, virtue is justified because it simply works for humans to obtain idealistic ways of living, like tranquility.

Don't just accept things but rather unconditionally and fanatically embrace everything,Treat the entire universe and the forces that created and sustain it as if it were your own.  Live vicariously through everything including yourself.  Because you treat all of reality as an extension of yourself you're desires become aligned with the way the universe unfolds as opposed to going against the grain and trying to change things beyond your control (which is futile).  I don't think acceptance of things is enough I'd argue that you must fanatically root for everything outside your control to unfold the way it does.  Embrace failure and struggle because you now identify with the totality of everything that unfolds instead of desire alone.  The difference between failure and success becomes blurred and ultimately irrelevant as you are no longer the one that failed but the forces that created the failure also.  You become metaphorically omnipotent and eternal as you now live vicariously through and identify with everything and anything the way it is.,Stoicism,1589477238.0,t3_gjqt51,0.5,0

However, Stoicism is not widely recognized yet. This is because we don't have a good symbol. A symbol to identify us as a group and start a conversation.

Sure, there are a few pictures of flames, but flame is hardly recognizable as a Stoic idea.

Instead, we need a new symbol. Something that can be as recognizable as the cross, or the apple logo. Something that people can see and quickly identify as Stoic, or at least spark conversation.

We need a logo that includes ideas such as Memento Mori, Amor Fati, Nature, Dichotomy of Control, negative visualisation,voluntary hardship, and change being the only constant.

Don't worry about this, I learnt that stoicism isn't suppressing emotion.

I don't understand why so many are like that.. I'm pretty lonely because I'm nothing like those kinds of guys (as in friendship, I'm straight), I'm a deep thinker, (who also over-thinks which is bad) and I'm nowhere near as sadistic as quite a few of them can be. Do they try to do it to be manly or something?? Its just weird, doesn't feel right and that they seem like quite mean people to me.. I cannot get along with those types of people well, my step-dad included.. I also wonder how they're so likeable compared to people like me if they aren't as emotionally available along with how they seem to not have much empathy.

I didn't know I fit stoicism to a T until today,"And I'm pretty excited... it makes sense that this is a philosophical way of thought but I never imagined it would be to this scope. 

If you don't mind me ranting and rambling a bit, let me tell you about myself. 

I am Chilean born, my parents brought me to the US illegally (unbeknownst to me) in the late 90s. Life was easy back then but after 9/11 a lot changed. Disappointment became a regular part of growing up as I wasn't able to take part in traveling field trips or competitions in high school, college past earning my AA seemed less than a dream. I married young, my high school sweetheart, both of us in hope to remedy my situation, but that soon turned sour too. My family since left, my marriage is was a nightmare I often remember, and after all of this the question I'm always asked is ""how do you do it?""

Till not I didn't know how to explain it. I would sometimes say ""well I'm still alive, so what choice do I have but to get over it?"" I rarely cry, maybe to a fault, I'm rarely able to get overwhelmed by a possibility because I know it could vanish., but I never knew that this was a way of life some people try to attain.

If anyone has some questions, feel free to ask, I've always been an open book of sorts. I'm pretty thrilled to see i finally have a name for how I think. People always made it seem like my thought processes were so depressing and I always brushed it off but it left me wondering if maybe I was missing out on something for not getting so overjoyed or upset at things.

The law of opposites,"My bad if I'm breaking any rules, but I had a random thought I wanted to share (also, sorry if this is a repost of sorts).

Basically, the law is that whenever something can be described in an overwhelming manner, the opposite is true but in the most subtle of ways. 
eg. Someone who is always happy may be acting that way to hide the fact that they feel distraught inside.
Someone who is rich and spends carelessly actually has less because of their inability to monitor their finances.
Someone who commits wrongdoings might be doing it to help someone they love, or maybe this is the universe's roundabout way of getting you to appeal to the person inside them who wants to do right.

Any fans of Tony Robbins here?,"Recently, I became fascinated with Tony Robbins. I haven't read any of his books yet but I've heard several hours of interviews and I noticed a few patters of thought popping up that remind of stoicism. 

One of the things that Tony says is that if you only had one week to live, you'd be able to enjoy the little things much more, so why not enjoy those things while you have more than a week to live? He defends that it's not the things that make you suffer but yourself. He defends that it's a choice to end your own suffering and also a choice when you do suffer. 

This reminded me so much of Stoicism because ""It is not things that disturb us, but our judgements about those things."" Also, just like Seneca wrote: ""it is not that life is short, but that we waste so much of it.""

Another central theme of Tony is that to have a truly good life you need to master the science of achievement (whether it is physical achievement or money or fame) but **also** master the art of fulfillment. He says often ""the ultimate failure is success without fulfillment.""

Again, this reminded me so much of how the Stoics view success: to them, the ultimate success is to have a great character, based on wisdom, courage, justice, and self-control. Only by having a great character can we feel fulfilled. Material wealth or a great body is not even related to our character, and the Stoics view this as external. Tony also says that of the two, it's better to feel fulfilled than to be successful. 

I was wondering if anybody here is also a fan of Tony Robbins and how that could have helped you become a Stoic or improved your life.",Stoicism,1471449588.0,t3_4y6egm,0.5,0
Come to /r/nonfictionbookclub for a group read of Walden by Henry David Thoreau.,"[Join us](https://www.reddit.com/r/nonfictionbookclub/comments/4sstud/and_the_winner_is_walden/) if u get the chance.

In Walden Henry talks about his time away from civilization and the busyness of life, to live a more simple one. A reading schedule will be up soon. I anticipate it relating to stoicism on at least some level.

Amazon Blurb:

Nature was a form of religion for naturalist, essayist, and early environmentalist Henry David Thoreau (1817–62). In communing with the natural world, he wished to ""live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and … learn what it had to teach."" Toward that end Thoreau built a cabin in the spring of 1845 on the shores of Walden Pond — on land owned by Ralph Waldo Emerson — outside Concord, Massachusetts. There he observed nature, farmed, built fences, surveyed, and wrote in his journal.

One product of his two-year sojourn was this book — a great classic of American letters. Interwoven with accounts of Thoreau's daily life (he received visitors and almost daily walked into Concord) are mediations on human existence, society, government, and other topics, expressed with wisdom and beauty of style.

Walden offers abundant evidence of Thoreau's ability to begin with observations on a mundane incident or the minutiae of nature and then develop these observations into profound ruminations on the most fundamental human concerns. Credited with influencing Tolstoy, Gandhi, and other thinkers, the volume remains a masterpiece of philosophical reflection.",Stoicism,1468705263.0,t3_4t6mrv,0.5,0

Natural Stoic?,"I have just recently found the stoic philosophy and realize I have been unknowingly living as a stoic since I was a young child! 

Here are a couple of examples!

When I was about 10 years old I learned that if I really wanted something if I focused on the thought of not getting it I was much more excited when I did eventually get it. For example my cousin would come and visit several times in the summer. I loved hanging out with him we always had a good time! As summer approached I would start to think about what summer would be like if he didn't visit.  Of course he did visit and I was grateful for it! I did the same when I wanted a toy or a new video game. I felt like it was my own magic power. I didn't always get what I wanted, but funny thing is I don't remember being disappointed that much when things didn't go my way. 

In my early teen years I started to play a game called ""what would I do if I were homeless"". I would think about where i would sleep when it got cold at night. Where I could get food from and actually come up with a plan for how I could make money. To this day I still play that game from time to time when traveling. My friends thought it was a very dark game and they didn't enjoy it nearly as much as I did.

The Benefits of Cold Showers.,"I’ll keep this brief. You wake up. You get your morning shower. Right at the end, after you’ve washed everything off, you turn that dial to the coldest it can go and you accept the icy water that rains down on your head and torso. You DO NOT think about it. You just DO. Why? Because you are becoming a man of action.

**THINK LESS; DO MORE.**

If you’re here, then perhaps you too overthink and ruminate - procrastinate too I imagine.

You get in that shower and you turn that dial **before you even have time to think**. Until it becomes a habit. Part of your morning routine.

The first time I started, I could only manage 10 seconds… on a good day! Then, as I continued ‘conquering my inner bitch’ and putting myself through it, it began to become euphoric… I now actually ENJOY the refreshing boost it gives me (no joke – when you’ve done your stint in the icy water, the feeling as you walk out and your body naturally begins to warm up is nothing short of amazing. Similar to that first sip of hot coffee on a cold day. An internally warming, all consuming warmth that envelopes your very soul).

I now do 30 seconds. Some days it’s hell. Some days it’s easy(ish). It doesn’t matter. **You accept it without judgement.** IT’S A MEDITATION. You give yourself to the act of throwing your body into something it’s screaming to get out of. You breathe - slow and deep. You wash the icy water over your body and you count in your head to 30 (or 10, 20… 100, whatever you can do eventually). Ancient samurai have always practiced this ancient technique, standing under icy waterfalls for long periods. It is the ultimate meditation. Your body is screaming at you to GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE! … but you don’t. YOU are in charge. Not your body. Not your desire. Not your urges. YOU are the master of your fate… the captain of your soul.

Start sacrificing yourself to the cold. Watch how your motivation and discipline skyrockets.

EDIT: Apologies if I’ve been misinterpreted, but I still feel this is 100% in line with Stoic philosophy. If my rhetoric has been misjudged, then I accept if some out there judge it as machismo. I am simply referring to the fact that no human wants to willingly place themselves in discomfort and to learn to do so (act rather than ruminating over how uncomfortable it will be, thus ‘conquering your inner bitch’ - not a reference to any gender, but the part of oneself who strives for comforts - again, dispensing of which is completely in line with stoic philosophy) will allow a person to accept the cold water as just that, cold water and momentary discomfort. This will in turn, allow them to live stoically rather than just reading about the great philosophers from a place of comfort.

I fully believe that this then allows a person to take this lesson with them throughout any other hardships as they have succeeded already in their day and not much can be as intensely discomforting as that icy water… yet still they go on.

Conflict over doing the right thing,"I have recently began to call people out on any behaviour I deem to be entitled. (Littering, parking in the middle of a road so no one can get through). This is not to be confused with ignorant or accidentally negative behaviour. More the actions that you know are a flagrant middle finger to everyone around them.

What should I be saying to them when confronting them? Am I demanding they change their actions? Am I just telling them that their behaviour is wrong? Is it all worth being threatened, knocked out or even killed for?",Stoicism,1705679968.0,t3_19amc1v,0.61,3
How do you cope with other's opinions,"I recently took to stoicism and it's principles. This was since February 2023. I have been working on myself physically, mentally and emotionally. Howover, recently I had the pleasure of meeting my friends of old. There was this one particular person that I had a falling out with. I have made amends to that relationship as best as possible later. But this particular person seems to enjoy picking me apart. I care for this person and I cryptically suggested that they reflect on their feelings and find out if they were going wrong in some way. Then they proceeded to rip me apart while poking on my insecurities. I have come to grips with that after some time. But they mentioned that I have this way of thinking wherein I feel that I am superior to everyone around me. Is sharing an opinion that you have wrong? And what do you do when someone you care about is doing wrong? Lastly, how do you remove yourself from caring about other's opinions of you? Please share your views. 
P.S. I'm not looking to find out if the other person is at fault. So please only comment on my thoughts and actions.",Stoicism,1702349877.0,t3_18gbv3k,0.58,2
Lost wallet,"Lost my wallet last night leaving the gym. I get in the car and I check my pocket and I don’t feel it. I run back to the gym and check all the areas i was in. It had my SSN green card Drivers license and  froze the credit card and debit cards. But the thing I’m worried about is My social security and my green card. I went back to the gym to check the footage and I see myself drop it outside near the parking lost and I see a person pick it up who then goes to workout at the gym. The gym has his info and they tried calling him he didn’t pick up. I hope he didn’t throw out my wallet after he took out the money.

I’m stressed about loosing my social security number because of identity theft and fraud. I don’t know whether I should wait or start the replacement process right now. 

I’m going to record the video of the person picking it up and take it to the police station with his info  if he doesn’t return it soon.

Stoic Approach to Dealing with Pedestrians Who Don't Share the Footpath,"I'm sure we've all been in this situation before.

It happened to me today, I was forced to step onto a road with traffic as a couple didn't bother to move.

Ryan Holiday Reading From Anything…,"Sorry this is old news but can we talk about Ryan Holiday?

He has very good podcast. Has become one of my favorites. When he speaks off the cuff and naturally it comes out normal and pleasant to the ears.

Recently he released a podcast where he reads a portion from his book. He sounded SUPER robotic and monotonous. This is to the point where he sounded like a middle schooler reading from a text book because his teacher picked him. It was so bad that it was completely unlistenable. Maybe I’m being petty and maybe some of you don’t care but for me…I can’t focus on anything else. 

I’m not trying to be hater because I honestly LOVE Ryan and his work. I was just so baffled that a man of his caliber is reads out loud like that. 

If you don’t believe me or think I’m exaggerating listen to the episode “Seneca the Striver”  and skip to when he starts reading directly from his book.

"as a high performer, going towards my first relationship turned my world upside down","**How I approach life**

I've always been a person that cared only about developing as much as I can at my job, knowledge, character and physical shape. This demands literally all of my time (I prefer to be great than happy, because when I'm not performing well, it's the only thing that makes me feel really bad).

I'm at my 20s, so I consider this time very important to reach the top of my profession, shape, etc. And maybe in my 30s after I've achieved some nice things, I would be able to focus on having a relationship with somebody.

Because of this lifestyle and way of thinking, I've never been in a relationship before, I tried once, but I didn't want to devote any time into thinking of what to say to somebody in order for them to like me and I've always been well alone (I like my freedom of going to the movies whenever I can and watch whatever I want without relying on another person), so I just stopped reaching out (~~only when writing this post I realized I ghosted someone, sorry)~~.

**The problem**

It may sound insane, but I've been self sufficient so far. The big problem is, this changed completely recently. I met somebody close to me which their character is really something I find really fine, and for the first time (after I evaluated the pros and cons lol) I've found somebody which we could both benefit immensely from each other on the long term.

This has been completely disrupting my thoughts. I can't really focus on something for long periods anymore, something else goes on my mind about how I should be approaching her, what should we be talking next, etc. The weird thing about it is, I tried to make the same move I did when a previous relationship started and just stop reaching out, but I simply can't (she's too close and we meet in person at least 4x week).

When I was face to face with her I tried to propose to start a relationship in the worst possible way (but still being kind), hoping she would reject me and I would be finally be able to focus on myself again, but she accepted (I was like wtf, why). Since then the problem continues, I can't be as performant as I was before. This has invaded my life, turned my thoughts upside down in a way I've never have experienced.

I really see a path where we could both live fine, but this process is messing so much with me. What I have tried so far is:

1. not thinking about it (yea obviously didn't work)
2. meditation (one way or another, doesn't matter if I can get it out of my head for 5mins, it still comes back later)
3. being patient and defining a timestamp to talk with her at night, so I could focus on other things (doesn't work)
4. focusing only on what I can control

&#x200B;

I had to write a post in this channel for the first time, because It has been almost a **month** since I'm struggling with it, and would be great if you have any advice on how I can approach this in a healthier manner. Thanks in advance!  


Edit: 

I think I found some answers in this AMA of how to get rid of intrusive thoughts by Andrew Huberman:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp9GXl9Qk\_s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp9GXl9Qk_s)  


Basically the solutions are:  
When thoughts are repetitive, try focusing on external things and do some mindful meditation  
When thoughts are traumatic, write things down with as much details as we can (journaling), huberman solved his own ocd problem by writing about the worst thing that can happen if he keeps thinking about it. This is due to journaling clearing our thoughts that are most cloudy about the event (which I think is what's happening to me as well, I'm really not sure how to deal with it, writing things down is probably going to solve it)

Is Stoicism anything more than life hacks?,"Given the modern understanding of morality, free will and psychology.

First thing is Stoicism is a complete ethical system, but in modern times we are starting to doubt are there any objective ones? How do you base something without Platonic Forms, categorical imperatives or God? 

The human happiness and the nature of humans also need a specific definition than the usual one to make it work. It's a lot of hoop jumping to satisfy as the philosophy for life. But if something exists, is not natural by it existince it self? 

The free will debate also, I started doubting free will when I read Sam Harris. The concept that we have any power over our actions seemed more and more unlikely. Like what agency do we really have over our actions, they can be predicted in the brain before we are aware of it. Everything is a causal chain it seems.",Stoicism,1681219708.0,t3_12ijxb6,0.38,0
Was my ex a stoic?,"I’m currently just getting into the reading of what being a stoic entails. 
I experienced some serious hardships rather rapidly in my life and because of them my partner of 4 years couldn’t handle my depression and moved on already with someone else, despite our past and all the years we were together. They seemed very unbothered by the breakup and moved on with the person that they cheated on me with already in order to protect their own happiness. 

Reading these stoic books I can’t help but wonder was my partner the stoic in this situation? 
Protecting themselves and choosing not to deal with my depression, rather than looking at the past, accepting the reality of the events (thus the indifference). Were they the stoics in this situation and I the weakminded? 
 
Specifically I am reading Stocism and the art of happiness and I can’t help but feel like they were the stoics in the situation, not thinking about the past but instead looking for the future. 

All inquiries are welcome.

How do you naturally becomes a quiet person (less talkative),"A lot of time I just talk out just because I'm getting some attention also any day where I talk less it feels like I just suppress myself or I'm just forcing myself, like I'm not a quiet person I'm just pretending.

How can I become a natural quiet person.

Also one thing I didn't understand is that, how one can be humorous and less talkative. Should humour just go away in months if you practice stoicism.
I m not someone who practices stoicism for a lot of time neither I understand lots of things about it to the core.

It also comes with another question how did you become the person you always wanted to be without feeling you are forcing or pretending, not to mention always forcing leads to the feeling of guilt when you just can't accomplish it.
