"Elitism, dismissiveness and just being plain unhelpful (Apologies if flair is incorrect)","I've noticed a lot of replies to certain posts on this sub end with some variation of ""stoicism isn't for you"".

Someone in all good faith is asking for help understanding something that took great thinkers lifetimes to master and their devoted admirers who believe in kindness essentially tell them ""No, you are wrong, go away.""

I find that confusing.

It's all well and good reminding people that distress comes from faulty reasoning but that alone doesn't automatically make someone reason correctly. When one is in the dark it's hard to see the path.",Stoicism,1705843567.0,t3_19c3deb,1.0,1
Hardest time in my relationship,"Hi guys, I 23M currently at my toughest point of my relationship with my gf 23F. She is currently thinking about the state of our relationship and where it is heading. Im afraid that we might be breaking up. I really love her a lot, its been really hard for me but thanks to this situation, I have connected more to the stoic teachings, especially Marcus Aeurilius. 

It inspired me to create this:

""An animal decays upon death, rocks seemingly eternal withers against time. Even trees who stand straight bows down eventually. What about the mind and soul? Pests and roots cannot reach it, as it is independent of the physical world. Time does not weaken or strengthen it, only philosophy and commitment to the divine self can. Make your mind a harbour for yourself and tend to it like a garden. It will be the only reliable light when darkness befalls on your life""",Stoicism,1705839496.0,t3_19c283c,0.5,0
Enchiridion 21,"“21. Let death and exile, and all other things which appear terrible be daily before your eyes, but chiefly death, and you will never entertain any abject thought, nor too eagerly covet anything.” 
Enchiridion 21,  Epictetus. 

My own interpretation is the following:  
""It's hard to be a good person when no one is watching. But know that posterity always watches. When you understand that your body and belongings will be returned at some point, and together with your actions(the result of your thoughts) will be judged by posterity. Then you will always be motivated to do the right thing.""

I am trying to understand the psychological mechanisms behind why visualising death will motivate me to not to think “abject thoughts” and “too eagerly covet anything”

I am not happy with my own interpretation and unpacking of Enchiridion 21 and would love to get your feedback and guidance?",Stoicism,1705827749.0,t3_19bzbjr,0.86,5
Dealing with my Breakup,"I have mostly been a person detached emotionally to concepts of relationship or having a girlfriend because of my first breakup . Anyway I had a friend for an year or so and eventually we both developed liking towards each other . And as days passed I realized I was deeply in love with her . Because of that I often ignored how she used to slide her toxicity ( she literally tried to convince me to against my family) , spoke shit about my father , and even when I tried to communicate my problems , she used to put the blame on me and use tears as her weapon against me . There was a guy in our lives who basically was fellow classmate . he tried to talk to her and they started sharing reels and stuff , I was unbothered by it . But as she was my girlfriend he labelled her a slut infont of our peers for talking to her . for which I literally had a fight with him threaten him and they stopped talking. Before our breakup my girlfriend told me that because I wasn't talking to her for awhile she started talking with him again. I feel quite lonely right now . not sure as to exactly how to deal with this.",Stoicism,1705824544.0,t3_19byjpf,0.71,3

Turning to you guys for help. Lost faith in life.,"Stoicism has helped me through many of my tough times but I’m out of it now, I’ve slipped into depression. 

This is why: I’m from a fairly lowly background and I dedicated my life to a career.  The idea was I would prove my worth by becoming successful through grit.  

Over the last few years:

One of my friends from a well-connected family got an offer from a friend - a connection.  He spent a lot of his life living like a playboy and now he’s leapfrogged me in career due to the network he has that I don’t. 

My other friend who didn’t graft like me is set in inherit money I would never dream of. 

My brother, who has spent a lot of his life avoiding hard work, has pushed a pretty weak medical negligence claim but will win more money than I’ll ever have and retire from it.  

My parents inherited all the family money and left nothing for us, spent it all on drugs and alcohol and on my brother.  

Now I am trapped working long hours in a hard career and I have less than all these people.  As I have to work hard my daughter is having issues in school.

The link between what I do and what I get is broken.  I’ve ended up with less than everyone but I did everything right.

I’m losing faith in life, everything.  I want to give up, it keeps happening. Everyone I know is ending up wealthy through fate and I’m stuck still with a mortgage, long hours etc. 

What was it all for?  I can’t stop as we will be impoverished.   Why did fate choose me to be the worker?  The other hilarious point is my earnings are taxed heavily but all their inheritance and claim is tax free, so I’m having to pay their taxes too. 

I know these are externals etc but I got to wake up at 5 every day and have health problems.  I got to have less time with kids. It’s not money, it’s my quality of life. 

I don’t have to be super rich and I don’t mind others good fortune but I feel like I’ve been conned.  It’s all mainly luck and God and fate seems to want to rub my nose in it.  It’s a good job I have kids otherwise after this happening so often I would want to check out of this corrupt and unfair world",Stoicism,1705813830.0,t3_19bvqaf,0.5,0

How can I deal with my boyfriend not making much time for me?,"Starting with the TL;DR because I definitely ranted! 

**TL/DR: My boyfriend has only been making time for me a few times a month. He expresses the desire to do better but seems to think he can pick up the slack once he has settled into his new job and bought us a house. I am feeling very neglected, don't have the means or friends in town to go out and do my own thing much the way he can, and I'm struggling to have patience.** 

I made the mistake of sending him long texts, then I didn't see him for all of November after that because he cannot handle conflict. 

I tapped into my stoicism and calmly laid it all out in a phone call and I thought he got the message ...  he said he understood that he hadn't made much time for me and he said ""I want us to get back to normal... no, better than our normal, you do deserve more of my time."" but it seems not. It's common for me to only see him a few times a month. 

I don't even want to see him every day! I just want to see him once a week. 

Last weekend he went to a cabin with his cousins which is something he does yearly, the weekend before that I only saw him for a few hours because he had to drop off my birth control pills, it wasn't a planned date, the weekend before that he was in another city visiting his aunt, the weekend before that we had a really fun staycation to celebrate Christmas, and the weekend before that we had a dinner date to make up after I almost broke up with him for avoiding me all of November.

 I saw him TWICE in December and for about 4 hours altogether this month so far. I get that he's busy, he has a good white-collar job and just started a new position, He lives with his narcissistic dad and his mom which I know is hard, and he has a lot of friends. But I went to university in a different city so I barely have any friends in town and my mom is terribly narcissistic as well so I end up isolated with her every weekend and she can be extremely brutal psychologically. I end up just doing endless chores while she barks orders and plays with my head a lot of the time. 

I am trying to have hobbies and I am making friends with my new co-workers but while he has the money to go out and do things .... that's not common right now! I do not! I'm planning on getting dinner with a work colleague but we have to budget for it so it won't be for a few weeks! I have an interview to be in a podcast tomorrow but then that's just more online friends, which are great! But I want him to have a bit of healthy jealousy that I am out on the town. I don't want him to be bored of me or to feel like he can leave me up on the shelf because I don't have the money or friends to go anywhere or do anything and I'm safe at home where other men won't see me and try to hit on me! 

He's trying to buy us a house and he seems to think everything will be fine when we actually live together but I can't logically assume there will suddenly be room for me in his life just because we live together. 

When I do spend time with him I am always positive and fun and he often drags out our dates as long as possible but these last 4 months have been so anxiety-inducing. Yet if I express my needs/unhappiness again I'll just be nagging at that point. 

I know I need to re-adjust through action, make myself less available to him, and focus on myself, but I am frustrated that I even have to do this! The immature part of my brain says ""there are plenty of people who would fall all over themselves to spend time with you."" but I still adore him and I don't want to break up, I just feel so f\*cking neglected! 

He also seems to think that every date has to be extravagant, so he's planning a trip into the mountains to go to some hot-springs, which I appreciate, I just wish we could do simple things even throughout the week together. I told him that and he agreed ... but I am losing patience waiting for him to implement the changes he promised! 

One of my best friends from university FaceTimed me the other night and asked if she could fly to me during Valentine's day week and have a trip into the mountains and I haven't seen her in person in two years. So I thought why not? And asked for the time off, if I'm approved I'm going to go and my boyfriend will have to spend Valentine's Day alone, he'll be working anyway! I kind of feel guilty but I can't really assume he has anything planned for us anyway, if he does it will be the weekend before or after. 

I just want to be mature and chill but it was really vulnerable for me to tell him I feel lonely in our relationship and that was weeks ago with minimal improvement. His ex compulsively cheated on him and I had the dark thought that I kind of relate to her, if he was the same way with her, I totally understand the urge to act out! Cheating is one of the worst ways a person can act out, but I certainly understand the impulse to do something, *ANYTHING*, to get his attention! 

He's going to a hockey game ""with the boyz"" tonight and I feel really bitter about it. I never thought I'd be the type of woman who is upset that her boyfriend is out with his friends, I want him to have fun with his friends ... but I also want more than like one-quarter of a boyfriend!!!!!! If he saw me regularly I'd be so happy for him that he gets to go out with them! It even annoys me when he talks about marriage as if it's inevitable even though I'm feeling alienated from him. I feel like a check-box he's got checked off that he can circle back around to when it's convenient. 

I need a game plan and I need to stay calm and regulated but it's hard. Any advice would be appreciated!",Stoicism,1705793507.0,t3_19bp6ta,0.45,0
What drugs was Marcus Aurelius taking?,"Galen, his physician, says that Marcus Aurelius took a traditional remedy called *theriac*, which contained ""a grain"" of opium. We don't know what precise quantity this denotes, unfortunately, but Galen seems to be implying that it was a small amount.  Marcus complained that it was making him drowsy, so Galen reduced the dose further.  Some people have speculated that he was an addict.  I don't think the evidence supports that conclusion as use in very small doses, from what I gather, wouldn't necessarily lead to addiction, and the fact that Marcus requested a *reduction* in the does perhaps also speaks against it.

What's less well-known, perhaps, is that we're told several times in the Roman histories that when Marcus finally visited Athens he was initiated into the mysteries at nearby Eleusis, in a ceremony which entailed drinking a potion known as the *kykeon.*  In his bestseller, *The Immortality Key: The Secret History of the Religion with No Name*, Brian C. Muraresku collects evidence that suggests the *kykeon* contained ergot, cultivated for its hallucinogenic properties.  Marcus' trip to Eleusis seems to have been an important public event but it happened in 176 CE, which was probably after he'd finished writing the *Meditations*.

Incidentally, a bust of a Roman emperor, believed to be Marcus, was placed over the main gate of the Temple of Demeter at Eleusis.  It still exists there today ([photo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Cuirassed_bust_of_Marcus_Aurelius%2C_Eleusis_%2813945732075%29.jpg)).

Makes me feel like i have nothing interesting or worthwhile or useful to say.

Years later,"Hi All, 28F looking for some advice here..

I grew up in a small town with a tight group of friends from elementary school through high school. Growing up, we were attached and all thought we’d be friends for the rest of our lives, in each others weddings etc. When we went off to college, we each went our separate ways, got jobs in different cities but stayed in contact thru social media, keeping each other up to date in a group message. At the time, I had gotten into a new relationship which eventually became toxic. I had made some new friends where I was studying/working and they knew about what was going on and what I was dealing with but I was so reluctant to tell my hometown friends about what I was going through.. I remember feeling embarrassed by the situation I was in. They all seemed happy and successful and I didn’t know how to communicate it. 3-4 months go by, (maybe more, I can’t remember exactly) where I don’t respond or update my life in this group message. One day I sign on and see that one of the girls removed me from the group. I remember a ton of emotions and at that time (6-7 years ago) I was still young and spite got over me, so I deleted all of my socia accounts which of course was wrong in hindsight. The first few months I felt pissed/angry and then as time went on, I felt an immense amount of guilt for never addressing it properly.  I’m at a point in my life where I know that we all moved on and that’s life, to accept it and I don’t feel as guilty as I did, considering no one reached out to me during one of the hardest times of my life to see how I was doing. But Im now having my own milestones my life and I miss them and so I’m having a hard time accepting it at the moment and I’m starting to feel guilty again",Stoicism,1705785978.0,t3_19bmd61,0.63,2
I've been (is) worried about the state of the world - was told about Stoicism,"Hello. I have been doomscrolling throughout the internet. I've been keep reading bad news all over the world ever since europe warns citizens from Russia.

I have a problem with not knowing everything and I cannot accept it (right now).

I've been reading about Russia/Ukraine, NATO/Russia, North Korea threats, Iran building nukes, Israel/Gaza war, China/Taiwan. To a point where I just couldn't handle all the information and just broke.

&#x200B;

So i've come here, hoping to learn from you guys. I don't know much about stoicism but I read this simple definition of the term ""In simple terms, Stoicism **teaches us to focus on the things we can control—our thoughts, emotions, and actions—while accepting the things we cannot**, such as the actions of others or the natural course of events going on in the world around us.""

This is probably just what I need to learn in my life, but I don't know how to accept that this is what I need to do.

Thanks for reading.

EDIT: I've told myself to STOP doomscrolling, stop watching all the news. Accepting that the world has always been screwed up, it's hard to take in everything. While I wish to stay informed, I don't believe I need to listen to every quote or read about everything. This is my first step.

My feeling when I am unhappy in general,"Hello, dear friends! ❤️

I have very difficult situation..
I am unhappy now .. in everything..
I am confused und very tired emotionally in soul. 

A lot of different situations create responsibilities for me which I must to do. It is not fantasy, it is from reality. 
As example, to study German language every day from 7:30 - 16:30 on classic school in 14 faculties and after study it in integration course 17:00-19:15 Monday - Thursday.
After I have to do a lot of tests and exams in Bio/Chemie/History/German Literature/Ethik/Art/Informatik/Math/another subjects in school for grades minimum 4 - maximum 1-2. And I have to do general exam in B1 German from integration course in March.
And in Juni I have to do Exam from German History for integration.

In another side, I have to do a volunteer project in school because it is special  important program for to get grades for all students in 9 classes from 3 faculties - GRW, Deutsch, Ethik. It is a main responsibility inside school for everyone in 9 class.

And also I have to do a lot of homeworks in 14 faculties of school and in integration course. 

I have to go to doctors also at this time when I must to be in the lessons.

I have to send all documents for Jobcenter because of Bafög (Bafög is smaller for me then Burgergeld which I got earlier. I can not to pay for my flat by this money, and for food it is also not anough per month). I have to write in Email a lot about it for Jobcenter. I am tired also of it.

I have to have good grades in study. When grades will badly in study faculties or in exam of integration German, - in faculties I have to repeat 9 class once more, and in integration corse I have to pay new course to repeat last level of German language because it is new law which government of Germant created for Ukrainians in January 2024. It is a biggest stress.

In result...

I love in my heart English, study in English, work in profession in English (as a UI/UX Designer - 5 years, Front-End developer - 7 years). 
I love to paint illustrations in study materials also.
I love a lot to be as a mentor in developing software (have 2 years experience in this area).
But...
I can not to do it in Germany.. because they from government wanted from me to study German language and go to work which they want (not a developer, not a designer/illustrator). For designer/illustrator/developer in requirements for work in companies they need a lot of ""Ausbildung in Graphik/Kunst/Digital"" , ""B2 Deutsch"", ""Akademische Ausbildung"".
When I see it, I feel myself unhappy. 

I am cry today a lot when I opened German language book of integration because I have to do a lot of Homeworks of study it, and I really hate it now(o Got, I said it.. hope, the Germans will not hate me of this). 

Why I have to do things and processes in Germany which I don't like/hate/because another institutions want it?

I feel happy when I paint illustrations of study books/materials, when I teach development for somebody and believe in this person, when I see how my student goes to get win in study process and how he gets it with happy in his face, when I can develop software by myself, when I can do researchment and read / collect special data of research for create some functions in software.. 

But.. I can not to do it in Germany.. 
I have education in internet from Ukraine, not from Ausbildung in Deutschland.. it is not enough here for work and study, and study German language for my mind is more difficult as English.

I really love English with all my heart.. I also would like to teach English for German people as a teacher.. but this needs Uni/Studium of Teaching and special license of teaching (only according German standards of teaching)

When I understand this, I am cry once more..
I am confused.. 

What do you think, what will do in my place Aristoteles or Mark Aurelius?/or Kannt/ or Nicshe?

I am very grateful for your help..

Because today I am in a border of depression..
During all last week I had to take Krankenschein because I am very tired psychologically and physically..

Begin Again,"""Your principles can't be extinguished unless you snuff out the thoughts that feed them, for it's continually in your power to reignite new ones... It's possible to start living again! See things anew as you once did - that is how to restart life!"" -Marcus Aurelius

To practice this I can recommend daily 10 minute breathing meditations: try to concentrate yourself on the flow of your breath, from the beginning of the breath till the end of it. Once you reaize your focus has turned on to something else, such as thoughts occuring in your mind, just begin again with a fresh focus on your breath. And now do the same thing with your principles. After all, what is life without your principles to define your meaning?",Stoicism,1705742859.0,t3_19b817t,0.81,6
I want advice that I can use in the moment. Not just platitudes to repeat.,"I get nervous around people. Socially anxious. I know that I don't want to give my thoughts and time over to what I think others think of me (ofcourse, unless it is something that is right) because I know that it is not a good use of time.

Advice like ""life is too short for this"" and ""They don't think about you"", or ""You can't control their thoughts"", or ""It's all in your head"", are kind of useless when my reaction is automatic and my thoughts are buried in my subconsciousness.

I need some advice that I can try daily to combat my subconscious thoughts, and also in the moment. I need something that can change that automatic reaction.

Though I am aware of these thoughts in the moment, and even talk to myself in my head to reason with myself right at that moment I realise I am having these thoughts, I can't control the ""stiffness"" I feel when I feel as if they're staring at me, or judging me. I know all those aforementioned sentences are true, but they don't help at all during the moment, no matter how much I believe them to be true.

Am I doing this the right way? Does it just take some time to change these subconscious thoughts?",Stoicism,1705742403.0,t3_19b7xep,0.83,16
Help with Stoic thinking over buying damaged external,"I can see where I’ve gone wrong already, in that I’ve been desiring an external for some time (a pair of nice sunglasses) and I finally bought them today.

However, they were damaged out of the box before I even got to wear them. (Didn't notice until I got home.)

Of course, I was flooded with anxiety and I let it ruin my whole day with value judgements over this being ""completely unfair"", ""the store won't help me"" that my sunglasses are ""ruined before I even got a chance to enjoy them"", and that ""I’m cursed as this always happens to me.""

Is it my job to stop any injustices I see around me?,"I’ve been thinking about this for a long time and have struggled to find an answer. For example, you see an employee in your family’s company get verbally abused often. 

It isn’t an event happening under my control. So it isn’t my job specifically to get involved. Even if I did get involved, the preventing of one instance won’t change the person doing the harm. They will continue to harm people. 

But another rationale to even think about interfering is that I really want to to create an environment in my business where everyone is treated with dignity. But I am also young and haven’t been given the responsibility or ownership to the business yet and any involvement in advising family members would only make relationships worse. 

How would you make a rational decision when something so complicated comes up? And in general, is it your job to stop injustices, or just accept it and move on knowing that there is evil everywhere.",Stoicism,1705739111.0,t3_19b750f,0.79,8
What would be beneficial for Stoic Student Association?,"Hello fellow stoics, I'm reaching out today for some ideas/suggestions on various items for a budget that might be useful for a Stoicism club at my university. I have the privilege of being able to construct a budget where I request money for the upcoming fiscal year that should be used to further the mission statement of the organization, which is quoted as follows:

>The Stoic Student Association’s mission is to educate the public on the lessons of Stoic philosophy and encourage the practical application of the teachings of philosophers from the Hellenistic to Roman Empires and beyond. In one meeting, we aim to discuss a particular Stoic lesson by engaging in discussion, sharing thoughts and experiences, and molding the idea to work in the modern world. Anybody is welcome to learn more about these teachings and provide insightful conversation to all members of the club. Ultimately, these Stoic teachings were developed thousands of years ago, and therefore a very important process for all members will be deciding how to interpret and practice them in the modern era.

I have the following ideas so far:

* Books
* Merchandise
* Special Events

However, at the current moment I only believe that books are the best source of information and progression for the organization, as they directly fit the mission statement of educating the public and leading to more engaging and thoughtful discussion. For merchandise, I suppose I could spin it to encouraging members to practice the philosophy and have it fit in the mission statement, and for special events, I don't even know what that really could be but it just sounds cool. Ultimately in the future I would like to have a notable modern Stoic maybe on a virtual call with the club, but that would be likely in a few years and by that time I'll be out of uni and seems like a stretch for the first budget request

Does anyone have any other ideas on items I could request on the budget that would fit the mission statement? One additional note is that we are a relatively small club (15 people total, maybe 6/7 per meeting sometimes). 

Thanks in advance for any suggestions!",Stoicism,1705721063.0,t3_19b24xp,0.67,2
My classmates think i am a creep but i cant prove i am not,"I am an international student and i have history of anxiety and depression. I was on meds for an year two years ago. I came to Canada to do my masters. Initially it was all good but on one day while i was walking on a street, a random stranger was acting weird by coming in and out of my sight alternatively in both sides behind me. I fret and kept an eye on him and suddenly from behind he tried to attack me. I barely dodged it. I ran away quickly to place where many people were there. This incident has triggered me anxiety and panic. I never reported or did anything about this.

Now in my class, there was this girl who always sat infront of me diagonally. I never noticed earlier but she was always making sudden movements, looking back dont know why, this has triggered my anxiety and panic and hypervigilance. My mind would switch to fight or flight kind of mode. Even without my control i would keep tabs on her from corner of my eye. I try not to but my anxiety and panic mind could never be controlled. I think at some point she picked that im looking at her from corner of eye. I feel bad because of fearing what she might think of me. I changed my seating place finally. It was all good but even in my new place, another girl who sat triggered my anxiety due to her sudden movements. Its becoming tough to me, i changed places but i noticed that this girl is also staring at me occasionally and i feel atrociously bad for sending such signals. I never have any kind of feelings or anything like that. Now i suspect or think others are also picking on that i am kind of a creep staring at women etc. I am changing my places and avoided seating near women st all due to this fear but I cant control my anxiety as i always fear due to the aggression attack i faced two months back.

I am trying to get back on my meds and began practising mindfulness. I came to know im suffering from hyperawareness, sensorimeter ocd coupled with anxiety. Due to mindfulness.  Its getting better and i am  changing my places(i plan to stop this). But i hate being perceived as a creep but i guess i cant do anything about it.  I yell to myself that their opinions on me dont matter as i am stoic follower, but i am finding it hard getting out of it. I think im silently suffering. 

Sometimes truth is stranger than you think, i believe its true in my case. 

I dont want to share my medical history with any of my classmates although i shared it with my close friend whom i trust. I just wanted to let all this situation out of my chest as its too heavy",Stoicism,1705719260.0,t3_19b1jms,0.68,13
Pleasant lie or Painful truth?,"I imagine its easy for stoics to say we prefer painful truths rather than unpleasant lies. Would you keep painful truth from your friends for the greater good? Can or should you live with it?

Lets say a bad deed or behaviour of your friends spouse is revealed to you. Would you expose the truth to the family of 3 children, and potentially ruin the lives of 5 people? As a flawed yet functioning family they are very happy, more productive and rich. Whats your course of action in the case?

This Stoicism quote is appropriate for today's distracted world.,"I recently read a quote by Marcus Aurelius that has been stuck in my brain ever since. The quote is full of insight and has benefited me greatly in several aspects of my life. I'd want to share the quote with you all.

**If you seek tranquility, do less. Or (more accurately) do what’s essential. Do less, better. Because most of what we do or say is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you’ll have more tranquility.

Dealing with Breakups,"i know that the title is a little cliche and perhaps something that is heard of a lot on this subreddit but i honestly don't know where to go with this 

i recently got out of a toxic relationship and around the end of it i picked up stoicism and reading stoic works particularly meditations 

the thing I struggle with in this scenario is dealing with some strange feeling i cant identify i deal with jealousy and while that was something i ignored in the relationship now that i ended things i feel guilty for worrying about who she may or may not be with. its a struggle just to be in the same room as her i have been able to manage my emotional reaction and not make rash decisions based on my feelings but the struggle i face is internal i understand that stoicism is not the practice of not feeling emotions but i do wish there was a way to temper my internal monologue a bit especially when i hear or see things that make me over think. i don't struggle with dealing with an external reaction at all i just struggle with being stoically minded particularly in the sense of what i do and do not control i want to be able to be at peace and happy knowing that she and her actions are not in my control and that it doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things one quote in particular ""we often struggle more in imagination then in reality"" comes to mind and im looking for any advice that might pertain to gaining the ability to be at peace internally and not just externally ",Stoicism,1705713098.0,t3_19azgto,0.4,0
Dealing with shitty neighbors.,"So I have these neighbors who are an absolute unit of dumbfuckery. My apartment has indoor hallways to get to the units and they consistently leave trash around for the cleaning lady to deal with. I'm talking zero regard for any kind of decency: throw up, fast food wrappings, melted chocolate (which really bothers me because of my dog.)
I'm struggling on how to deal with this the proper way and I'm trying to turn to stoicism, as I have in the past to try to find the best solution. I'm not too versed in stoicism besides the introductory readings, such as Aurelius and Epictetus, so any advice is much appreciated.
On one hand I can see the stoic belief being to make society better with what I can control i.e. helping the cleaning lady out picking up trash as I go and such.
However, as is the pattern with many shitty people this just reinforces the bad behavior. Stoics also seem to have an innate sense of justice and so how would I go about helping these individuals become better people so that the community is a better place? It might be petty but I've collected the trash and set it at their door before but having a conversation is not possible because of a language barrier. Front office will do nothing because there's never any direct evidence that but  in the building knows who it is. Thank you, in advance, for any insight.",Stoicism,1705705262.0,t3_19awhqb,0.7,4
By whom are the 4 basic stoic vritues that get so often quoted on here?,"I've read a bit Marc Aurel and some interpretations of Epictetus and those very never (as the ""cardinal virtues"") mentioned. Online (horrible source though) it seemed like the 4 virtues are by Zeno himself, but it didn't seem very legit at all.

Personally, it seems to me that people (on this sub as well) often use these as an easy way out (rather than an easy way into more stoicism) and oversimplify their world view by trying to follow them to the end. Of course i've seen them beeing mentioned, but only amongst other wisdoms (or ""virtues"" for the sake of it). All of them are mentioned countless times in meditations the interpretation of Epictetus i read, but never as THE BIG FOUR.

What drugs was Marcus Aurelius taking?,"Galen, his physician, says that Marcus Aurelius took a traditional remedy called *theriac*, which contained ""a grain"" of opium. We don't know what precise quantity this denotes, unfortunately, but Galen seems to be implying that it was a small amount.  Marcus complained that it was making him drowsy, so Galen reduced the dose further.  Some people have speculated that he was an addict.  I don't think the evidence supports that conclusion as use in very small doses, from what I gather, wouldn't necessarily lead to addiction, and the fact that Marcus requested a *reduction* in the does perhaps also speaks against it.

What's less well-known, perhaps, is that we're told several times in the Roman histories that when Marcus finally visited Athens he was initiated into the mysteries at nearby Eleusis, in a ceremony which entailed drinking a potion known as the *kykeon.*  In his bestseller, *The Immortality Key: The Secret History of the Religion with No Name*, Brian C. Muraresku collects evidence that suggests the *kykeon* contained ergot, cultivated for its hallucinogenic properties.  Marcus' trip to Eleusis seems to have been an important public event but it happened in 176 CE, which was probably after he'd finished writing the *Meditations*.

Incidentally, a bust of a Roman emperor, believed to be Marcus, was placed over the main gate of the Temple of Demeter at Eleusis.  It still exists there today ([photo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Cuirassed_bust_of_Marcus_Aurelius%2C_Eleusis_%2813945732075%29.jpg)).

Enchiridion 21,"“21. Let death and exile, and all other things which appear terrible be daily before your eyes, but chiefly death, and you will never entertain any abject thought, nor too eagerly covet anything.” 
Enchiridion 21,  Epictetus. 

My own interpretation is the following:  
""It's hard to be a good person when no one is watching. But know that posterity always watches. When you understand that your body and belongings will be returned at some point, and together with your actions(the result of your thoughts) will be judged by posterity. Then you will always be motivated to do the right thing.""

I am trying to understand the psychological mechanisms behind why visualising death will motivate me to not to think “abject thoughts” and “too eagerly covet anything”

I've been reading about Russia/Ukraine, NATO/Russia, North Korea threats, Iran building nukes, Israel/Gaza war, China/Taiwan. To a point where I just couldn't handle all the information and just broke.

&#x200B;

So i've come here, hoping to learn from you guys. I don't know much about stoicism but I read this simple definition of the term ""In simple terms, Stoicism **teaches us to focus on the things we can control—our thoughts, emotions, and actions—while accepting the things we cannot**, such as the actions of others or the natural course of events going on in the world around us.""

This is probably just what I need to learn in my life, but I don't know how to accept that this is what I need to do.

Turning to you guys for help. Lost faith in life.,"Stoicism has helped me through many of my tough times but I’m out of it now, I’ve slipped into depression. 

This is why: I’m from a fairly lowly background and I dedicated my life to a career.  The idea was I would prove my worth by becoming successful through grit.  

Over the last few years:

One of my friends from a well-connected family got an offer from a friend - a connection.  He spent a lot of his life living like a playboy and now he’s leapfrogged me in career due to the network he has that I don’t. 

My other friend who didn’t graft like me is set in inherit money I would never dream of. 

My brother, who has spent a lot of his life avoiding hard work, has pushed a pretty weak medical negligence claim but will win more money than I’ll ever have and retire from it.  

My parents inherited all the family money and left nothing for us, spent it all on drugs and alcohol and on my brother.  

Now I am trapped working long hours in a hard career and I have less than all these people.  As I have to work hard my daughter is having issues in school.

The link between what I do and what I get is broken.  I’ve ended up with less than everyone but I did everything right.

I’m losing faith in life, everything.  I want to give up, it keeps happening. Everyone I know is ending up wealthy through fate and I’m stuck still with a mortgage, long hours etc. 

What was it all for?  I can’t stop as we will be impoverished.   Why did fate choose me to be the worker?  The other hilarious point is my earnings are taxed heavily but all their inheritance and claim is tax free, so I’m having to pay their taxes too. 

I know these are externals etc but I got to wake up at 5 every day and have health problems.  I got to have less time with kids. It’s not money, it’s my quality of life. 

I don’t have to be super rich and I don’t mind others good fortune but I feel like I’ve been conned.  It’s all mainly luck and God and fate seems to want to rub my nose in it.  It’s a good job I have kids otherwise after this happening so often I would want to check out of this corrupt and unfair world",Stoicism,1705813830.0,t3_19bvqaf,0.5,0
I know what i need to do i just dont know what to do about it. I base my self worth on external factors and its making me miserable.. like not having friends makes me feel worthless. Or not knowing how to make them.,"Its like i depend my entire personality and life and worth on others reactions to something i did or said and most times online i just get ignored or its always me texting first, maybe i dont know how to carry a conversation or make it fun. 

For example no one is talking with me rn and its making feel worthless. 

Makes me feel like i have nothing interesting or worthwhile or useful to say. 

Most times i try to say something like this i get left on seen or in real life people say reply with one words. 

What do i need to do? Read? Meditate? Find a hobby? Follow my interests? Learn more about conversations and talking? Set boundaries? Do things that make me happy? Set a specific goal and achieve it? I have many problems but im trying not to overwhelm my self and just focus on one thing at a time. 

And it all goes back to low self esteem.. like i don't think girls will be interested in me, like i feel like im good enough.",Stoicism,1705788345.0,t3_19bn9go,0.81,3
Years later,"Hi All, 28F looking for some advice here..

I grew up in a small town with a tight group of friends from elementary school through high school. Growing up, we were attached and all thought we’d be friends for the rest of our lives, in each others weddings etc. When we went off to college, we each went our separate ways, got jobs in different cities but stayed in contact thru social media, keeping each other up to date in a group message. At the time, I had gotten into a new relationship which eventually became toxic. I had made some new friends where I was studying/working and they knew about what was going on and what I was dealing with but I was so reluctant to tell my hometown friends about what I was going through.. I remember feeling embarrassed by the situation I was in. They all seemed happy and successful and I didn’t know how to communicate it. 3-4 months go by, (maybe more, I can’t remember exactly) where I don’t respond or update my life in this group message. One day I sign on and see that one of the girls removed me from the group. I remember a ton of emotions and at that time (6-7 years ago) I was still young and spite got over me, so I deleted all of my socia accounts which of course was wrong in hindsight. The first few months I felt pissed/angry and then as time went on, I felt an immense amount of guilt for never addressing it properly.  I’m at a point in my life where I know that we all moved on and that’s life, to accept it and I don’t feel as guilty as I did, considering no one reached out to me during one of the hardest times of my life to see how I was doing. But Im now having my own milestones my life and I miss them and so I’m having a hard time accepting it at the moment and I’m starting to feel guilty again",Stoicism,1705785978.0,t3_19bmd61,0.67,3
Stoicism and the world,"I'm flairing this as meditation because I ask this based on what makes me think of Stoicism better. Feel free to correct that if it's wrong.

Cosmopolitanism has been my gateway to the ideal, as I tend to understand things better if in the frame of mind of current events, but I notice it's like a needle in a haystack to find actual significant people who feel this way. What nation of the world would you say most closely matches stoic ideals right now based on how the nation is run (or how it's populated, if there's a different answer to that)?",Stoicism,1705804665.0,t3_19bt07m,0.6,1
My feeling when I am unhappy in general,"Hello, dear friends! ❤️

I have very difficult situation..
I am unhappy now .. in everything..
I am confused und very tired emotionally in soul. 

A lot of different situations create responsibilities for me which I must to do. It is not fantasy, it is from reality. 
As example, to study German language every day from 7:30 - 16:30 on classic school in 14 faculties and after study it in integration course 17:00-19:15 Monday - Thursday.
After I have to do a lot of tests and exams in Bio/Chemie/History/German Literature/Ethik/Art/Informatik/Math/another subjects in school for grades minimum 4 - maximum 1-2. And I have to do general exam in B1 German from integration course in March.
And in Juni I have to do Exam from German History for integration.

In another side, I have to do a volunteer project in school because it is special  important program for to get grades for all students in 9 classes from 3 faculties - GRW, Deutsch, Ethik. It is a main responsibility inside school for everyone in 9 class.

And also I have to do a lot of homeworks in 14 faculties of school and in integration course. 

I have to go to doctors also at this time when I must to be in the lessons.

I have to send all documents for Jobcenter because of Bafög (Bafög is smaller for me then Burgergeld which I got earlier. I can not to pay for my flat by this money, and for food it is also not anough per month). I have to write in Email a lot about it for Jobcenter. I am tired also of it.

I have to have good grades in study. When grades will badly in study faculties or in exam of integration German, - in faculties I have to repeat 9 class once more, and in integration corse I have to pay new course to repeat last level of German language because it is new law which government of Germant created for Ukrainians in January 2024. It is a biggest stress.

In result...

I love in my heart English, study in English, work in profession in English (as a UI/UX Designer - 5 years, Front-End developer - 7 years). 
I love to paint illustrations in study materials also.
I love a lot to be as a mentor in developing software (have 2 years experience in this area).
But...
I can not to do it in Germany.. because they from government wanted from me to study German language and go to work which they want (not a developer, not a designer/illustrator). For designer/illustrator/developer in requirements for work in companies they need a lot of ""Ausbildung in Graphik/Kunst/Digital"" , ""B2 Deutsch"", ""Akademische Ausbildung"".
When I see it, I feel myself unhappy. 

I am cry today a lot when I opened German language book of integration because I have to do a lot of Homeworks of study it, and I really hate it now(o Got, I said it.. hope, the Germans will not hate me of this). 

Why I have to do things and processes in Germany which I don't like/hate/because another institutions want it?

I feel happy when I paint illustrations of study books/materials, when I teach development for somebody and believe in this person, when I see how my student goes to get win in study process and how he gets it with happy in his face, when I can develop software by myself, when I can do researchment and read / collect special data of research for create some functions in software.. 

But.. I can not to do it in Germany.. 
I have education in internet from Ukraine, not from Ausbildung in Deutschland.. it is not enough here for work and study, and study German language for my mind is more difficult as English.

I really love English with all my heart.. I also would like to teach English for German people as a teacher.. but this needs Uni/Studium of Teaching and special license of teaching (only according German standards of teaching)

When I understand this, I am cry once more..
I am confused.. 

What do you think, what will do in my place Aristoteles or Mark Aurelius?/or Kannt/ or Nicshe?

I am very grateful for your help..

Because today I am in a border of depression..
During all last week I had to take Krankenschein because I am very tired psychologically and physically..

I want advice that I can use in the moment. Not just platitudes to repeat.,"I get nervous around people. Socially anxious. I know that I don't want to give my thoughts and time over to what I think others think of me (ofcourse, unless it is something that is right) because I know that it is not a good use of time.

Advice like ""life is too short for this"" and ""They don't think about you"", or ""You can't control their thoughts"", or ""It's all in your head"", are kind of useless when my reaction is automatic and my thoughts are buried in my subconsciousness.

I need some advice that I can try daily to combat my subconscious thoughts, and also in the moment. I need something that can change that automatic reaction.

Though I am aware of these thoughts in the moment, and even talk to myself in my head to reason with myself right at that moment I realise I am having these thoughts, I can't control the ""stiffness"" I feel when I feel as if they're staring at me, or judging me. I know all those aforementioned sentences are true, but they don't help at all during the moment, no matter how much I believe them to be true.

Am I doing this the right way? Does it just take some time to change these subconscious thoughts?",Stoicism,1705742403.0,t3_19b7xep,0.8,14

My biggest life mistake was wanting to live an easy life,"2023 summons this the best, I didn’t want to exercise, diet, barely studied, barely did anything useful, expected my friend to do all the work for me, procrastinated a lot by saying that “tomorrow I start to do this”, got addicted to porn, tried to be a people pleaser (even going against some of my own believes), etc 

I regressed a lot as a person and what  were my rewards for wanting to live an easy life basically in autopilot with no logic and following just pure emotions ? Anxiety, memory issues, suicidal thoughts, weight gain, burnout, a lot of extra final exams that almost cost me a full semester, almost lost some of my friendships, i got way behind my peers and didn’t get my driver’s license 

Growing up I was never pushed/expected to do great things, if I was average that was enough for my parents and me, my mom basically did my homework for me, I would eat and watch tv all day and not leave the apartment and no one would care, so I never developed discipline, sense of urgency and maturity 

I have my ups and downs but basically to this day I lack those core elements and the 4 stoic principles 

With no temperance no self discipline nor control so I will waste my days with pleasurable things and just “do the important things tomorrow”, even tho nothing guarantees me a tomorrow

With no wisdom no intelligence and resourcefulness making me have bad grades at my college and be afraid to treat patients (I’m learning to be a dentist but I don’t reread core concepts such as anesthesia so I just ask my friend to do all the work for me at the clinic)

With no courage no scape from my comfort zone so I don’t try to improve myself 

With no justice I abandon my principles of wanting to be a good man and focus only on pleasing people and not strengthening or even developing a sense of character 

I hope that this serves me as an experience of what living a shallow existence is and how to always try to be better than yourself from yesterday (even if it takes baby steps)",Stoicism,1705691126.0,t3_19aqv6w,0.97,172

This Stoicism quote is appropriate for today's distracted world.,"I recently read a quote by Marcus Aurelius that has been stuck in my brain ever since. The quote is full of insight and has benefited me greatly in several aspects of my life. I'd want to share the quote with you all.

**If you seek tranquility, do less. Or (more accurately) do what’s essential. Do less, better. Because most of what we do or say is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you’ll have more tranquility. But to eliminate the necessary actions, we need to eliminate unnecessary assumptions as well.  — Marcus Aurelius**",Stoicism,1705717908.0,t3_19b13qg,0.92,32
Begin Again,"""Your principles can't be extinguished unless you snuff out the thoughts that feed them, for it's continually in your power to reignite new ones... It's possible to start living again! See things anew as you once did - that is how to restart life!"" -Marcus Aurelius

To practice this I can recommend daily 10 minute breathing meditations: try to concentrate yourself on the flow of your breath, from the beginning of the breath till the end of it. Once you reaize your focus has turned on to something else, such as thoughts occuring in your mind, just begin again with a fresh focus on your breath. And now do the same thing with your principles. After all, what is life without your principles to define your meaning?",Stoicism,1705742859.0,t3_19b817t,0.89,7
Is it my job to stop any injustices I see around me?,"I’ve been thinking about this for a long time and have struggled to find an answer. For example, you see an employee in your family’s company get verbally abused often. 

It isn’t an event happening under my control. So it isn’t my job specifically to get involved. Even if I did get involved, the preventing of one instance won’t change the person doing the harm. They will continue to harm people. 

But another rationale to even think about interfering is that I really want to to create an environment in my business where everyone is treated with dignity. But I am also young and haven’t been given the responsibility or ownership to the business yet and any involvement in advising family members would only make relationships worse. 

How would you make a rational decision when something so complicated comes up? And in general, is it your job to stop injustices, or just accept it and move on knowing that there is evil everywhere.",Stoicism,1705739111.0,t3_19b750f,0.74,7
How can I deal with my boyfriend not making much time for me?,"Starting with the TL;DR because I definitely ranted! 

**TL/DR: My boyfriend has only been making time for me a few times a month. He expresses the desire to do better but seems to think he can pick up the slack once he has settled into his new job and bought us a house. I am feeling very neglected, don't have the means or friends in town to go out and do my own thing much the way he can, and I'm struggling to have patience.** 

I made the mistake of sending him long texts, then I didn't see him for all of November after that because he cannot handle conflict. 

I tapped into my stoicism and calmly laid it all out in a phone call and I thought he got the message ...  he said he understood that he hadn't made much time for me and he said ""I want us to get back to normal... no, better than our normal, you do deserve more of my time."" but it seems not. It's common for me to only see him a few times a month. 

I don't even want to see him every day! I just want to see him once a week. 

Last weekend he went to a cabin with his cousins which is something he does yearly, the weekend before that I only saw him for a few hours because he had to drop off my birth control pills, it wasn't a planned date, the weekend before that he was in another city visiting his aunt, the weekend before that we had a really fun staycation to celebrate Christmas, and the weekend before that we had a dinner date to make up after I almost broke up with him for avoiding me all of November.

 I saw him TWICE in December and for about 4 hours altogether this month so far. I get that he's busy, he has a good white-collar job and just started a new position, He lives with his narcissistic dad and his mom which I know is hard, and he has a lot of friends. But I went to university in a different city so I barely have any friends in town and my mom is terribly narcissistic as well so I end up isolated with her every weekend and she can be extremely brutal psychologically. I end up just doing endless chores while she barks orders and plays with my head a lot of the time. 

I am trying to have hobbies and I am making friends with my new co-workers but while he has the money to go out and do things .... that's not common right now! I do not! I'm planning on getting dinner with a work colleague but we have to budget for it so it won't be for a few weeks! I have an interview to be in a podcast tomorrow but then that's just more online friends, which are great! But I want him to have a bit of healthy jealousy that I am out on the town. I don't want him to be bored of me or to feel like he can leave me up on the shelf because I don't have the money or friends to go anywhere or do anything and I'm safe at home where other men won't see me and try to hit on me! 

He's trying to buy us a house and he seems to think everything will be fine when we actually live together but I can't logically assume there will suddenly be room for me in his life just because we live together. 

When I do spend time with him I am always positive and fun and he often drags out our dates as long as possible but these last 4 months have been so anxiety-inducing. Yet if I express my needs/unhappiness again I'll just be nagging at that point. 

I know I need to re-adjust through action, make myself less available to him, and focus on myself, but I am frustrated that I even have to do this! The immature part of my brain says ""there are plenty of people who would fall all over themselves to spend time with you."" but I still adore him and I don't want to break up, I just feel so f\*cking neglected! 

He also seems to think that every date has to be extravagant, so he's planning a trip into the mountains to go to some hot-springs, which I appreciate, I just wish we could do simple things even throughout the week together. I told him that and he agreed ... but I am losing patience waiting for him to implement the changes he promised! 

One of my best friends from university FaceTimed me the other night and asked if she could fly to me during Valentine's day week and have a trip into the mountains and I haven't seen her in person in two years. So I thought why not? And asked for the time off, if I'm approved I'm going to go and my boyfriend will have to spend Valentine's Day alone, he'll be working anyway! I kind of feel guilty but I can't really assume he has anything planned for us anyway, if he does it will be the weekend before or after. 

I just want to be mature and chill but it was really vulnerable for me to tell him I feel lonely in our relationship and that was weeks ago with minimal improvement. His ex compulsively cheated on him and I had the dark thought that I kind of relate to her, if he was the same way with her, I totally understand the urge to act out! Cheating is one of the worst ways a person can act out, but I certainly understand the impulse to do something, *ANYTHING*, to get his attention! 

He's going to a hockey game ""with the boyz"" tonight and I feel really bitter about it. I never thought I'd be the type of woman who is upset that her boyfriend is out with his friends, I want him to have fun with his friends ... but I also want more than like one-quarter of a boyfriend!!!!!! If he saw me regularly I'd be so happy for him that he gets to go out with them! It even annoys me when he talks about marriage as if it's inevitable even though I'm feeling alienated from him. I feel like a check-box he's got checked off that he can circle back around to when it's convenient.

My classmates think i am a creep but i cant prove i am not,"I am an international student and i have history of anxiety and depression. I was on meds for an year two years ago. I came to Canada to do my masters. Initially it was all good but on one day while i was walking on a street, a random stranger was acting weird by coming in and out of my sight alternatively in both sides behind me. I fret and kept an eye on him and suddenly from behind he tried to attack me. I barely dodged it. I ran away quickly to place where many people were there. This incident has triggered me anxiety and panic. I never reported or did anything about this.

Now in my class, there was this girl who always sat infront of me diagonally. I never noticed earlier but she was always making sudden movements, looking back dont know why, this has triggered my anxiety and panic and hypervigilance. My mind would switch to fight or flight kind of mode. Even without my control i would keep tabs on her from corner of my eye. I try not to but my anxiety and panic mind could never be controlled. I think at some point she picked that im looking at her from corner of eye. I feel bad because of fearing what she might think of me. I changed my seating place finally. It was all good but even in my new place, another girl who sat triggered my anxiety due to her sudden movements. Its becoming tough to me, i changed places but i noticed that this girl is also staring at me occasionally and i feel atrociously bad for sending such signals. I never have any kind of feelings or anything like that. Now i suspect or think others are also picking on that i am kind of a creep staring at women etc. I am changing my places and avoided seating near women st all due to this fear but I cant control my anxiety as i always fear due to the aggression attack i faced two months back.

I am trying to get back on my meds and began practising mindfulness. I came to know im suffering from hyperawareness, sensorimeter ocd coupled with anxiety. Due to mindfulness.  Its getting better and i am  changing my places(i plan to stop this). But i hate being perceived as a creep but i guess i cant do anything about it.  I yell to myself that their opinions on me dont matter as i am stoic follower, but i am finding it hard getting out of it. I think im silently suffering.

Help with Stoic thinking over buying damaged external,"I can see where I’ve gone wrong already, in that I’ve been desiring an external for some time (a pair of nice sunglasses) and I finally bought them today.

Of course, I was flooded with anxiety and I let it ruin my whole day with value judgements over this being ""completely unfair"", ""the store won't help me"" that my sunglasses are ""ruined before I even got a chance to enjoy them"", and that ""I’m cursed as this always happens to me.""

Dealing with shitty neighbors.,"So I have these neighbors who are an absolute unit of dumbfuckery. My apartment has indoor hallways to get to the units and they consistently leave trash around for the cleaning lady to deal with. I'm talking zero regard for any kind of decency: throw up, fast food wrappings, melted chocolate (which really bothers me because of my dog.)
I'm struggling on how to deal with this the proper way and I'm trying to turn to stoicism, as I have in the past to try to find the best solution. I'm not too versed in stoicism besides the introductory readings, such as Aurelius and Epictetus, so any advice is much appreciated.
On one hand I can see the stoic belief being to make society better with what I can control i.e. helping the cleaning lady out picking up trash as I go and such.
However, as is the pattern with many shitty people this just reinforces the bad behavior. Stoics also seem to have an innate sense of justice and so how would I go about helping these individuals become better people so that the community is a better place? It might be petty but I've collected the trash and set it at their door before but having a conversation is not possible because of a language barrier. Front office will do nothing because there's never any direct evidence that but  in the building knows who it is. Thank you, in advance, for any insight.",Stoicism,1705705262.0,t3_19awhqb,0.67,4
How does one stop being so emotional?,"
Hello,

A few months ago, I stumbled upon stoicism, and I've been thoroughly enjoying immersing myself in its teachings and practicing to become a true stoic, striving to be the best version of myself. However, I find that I'm facing a challenge in effectively harnessing my emotions. I comprehend that the teachings emphasize the practice of refraining from expressing unnecessary emotions, but I'm particularly struggling with becoming less emotional, especially in my interactions with other people. How can one navigate the path to emotional restraint and cultivate a more stoic approach, particularly in interpersonal relationships?

Even though I have researched and tried to apply my findings of stoicism, I feel that the one thing I still struggle to control is my emotional decision-making.

It’s easy to say to yourself “stop being emotional,” but I find it’s counterintuitive, especially if you encounter situations that will strike an intense emotion.

I appreciate your feedback.",Stoicism,1705688478.0,t3_19apsri,0.87,11
What would be beneficial for Stoic Student Association?,"Hello fellow stoics, I'm reaching out today for some ideas/suggestions on various items for a budget that might be useful for a Stoicism club at my university. I have the privilege of being able to construct a budget where I request money for the upcoming fiscal year that should be used to further the mission statement of the organization, which is quoted as follows:

>The Stoic Student Association’s mission is to educate the public on the lessons of Stoic philosophy and encourage the practical application of the teachings of philosophers from the Hellenistic to Roman Empires and beyond. In one meeting, we aim to discuss a particular Stoic lesson by engaging in discussion, sharing thoughts and experiences, and molding the idea to work in the modern world. Anybody is welcome to learn more about these teachings and provide insightful conversation to all members of the club. Ultimately, these Stoic teachings were developed thousands of years ago, and therefore a very important process for all members will be deciding how to interpret and practice them in the modern era.

I have the following ideas so far:

* Books
* Merchandise
* Special Events

However, at the current moment I only believe that books are the best source of information and progression for the organization, as they directly fit the mission statement of educating the public and leading to more engaging and thoughtful discussion. For merchandise, I suppose I could spin it to encouraging members to practice the philosophy and have it fit in the mission statement, and for special events, I don't even know what that really could be but it just sounds cool. Ultimately in the future I would like to have a notable modern Stoic maybe on a virtual call with the club, but that would be likely in a few years and by that time I'll be out of uni and seems like a stretch for the first budget request

Does anyone have any other ideas on items I could request on the budget that would fit the mission statement? One additional note is that we are a relatively small club (15 people total, maybe 6/7 per meeting sometimes). 

Thanks in advance for any suggestions!",Stoicism,1705721063.0,t3_19b24xp,0.67,2

Dealing with Breakups,"i know that the title is a little cliche and perhaps something that is heard of a lot on this subreddit but i honestly don't know where to go with this 

i recently got out of a toxic relationship and around the end of it i picked up stoicism and reading stoic works particularly meditations 

the thing I struggle with in this scenario is dealing with some strange feeling i cant identify i deal with jealousy and while that was something i ignored in the relationship now that i ended things i feel guilty for worrying about who she may or may not be with. its a struggle just to be in the same room as her i have been able to manage my emotional reaction and not make rash decisions based on my feelings but the struggle i face is internal i understand that stoicism is not the practice of not feeling emotions but i do wish there was a way to temper my internal monologue a bit especially when i hear or see things that make me over think. i don't struggle with dealing with an external reaction at all i just struggle with being stoically minded particularly in the sense of what i do and do not control i want to be able to be at peace and happy knowing that she and her actions are not in my control and that it doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things one quote in particular ""we often struggle more in imagination then in reality"" comes to mind and im looking for any advice that might pertain to gaining the ability to be at peace internally and not just externally ",Stoicism,1705713098.0,t3_19azgto,0.4,0
Does stoicism care anything about how simplistic or grand your goals are?,"I've been thinking a lot about meaning lately, and I guess I'm in somewhat of a crisis. 

I know a lot of people in the world might say that if you want meaning or purpose in your life you need a respectable goal. Which, on the surface, I can understand. 

My concern is that...what does it mean if you can't? What if you fail? We're all prone to do so. What if other obligations come along and you have to give up your dreams? What if you become disabled? What if you straight up die the very day you decide on a goal? 

I'm not saying that if someone is dreaming of being an astronaut they should just give up. But should our goals be where we find meaning and contentment?

What drugs was Marcus Aurelius taking?,"Galen, his physician, says that Marcus Aurelius took a traditional remedy called *theriac*, which contained ""a grain"" of opium. We don't know what precise quantity this denotes, unfortunately, but Galen seems to be implying that it was a small amount.  Marcus complained that it was making him drowsy, so Galen reduced the dose further.  Some people have speculated that he was an addict.  I don't think the evidence supports that conclusion as use in very small doses, from what I gather, wouldn't necessarily lead to addiction, and the fact that Marcus requested a *reduction* in the does perhaps also speaks against it.

What's less well-known, perhaps, is that we're told several times in the Roman histories that when Marcus finally visited Athens he was initiated into the mysteries at nearby Eleusis, in a ceremony which entailed drinking a potion known as the *kykeon.*  In his bestseller, *The Immortality Key: The Secret History of the Religion with No Name*, Brian C. Muraresku collects evidence that suggests the *kykeon* contained ergot, cultivated for its hallucinogenic properties.  Marcus' trip to Eleusis seems to have been an important public event but it happened in 176 CE, which was probably after he'd finished writing the *Meditations*.

Incidentally, a bust of a Roman emperor, believed to be Marcus, was placed over the main gate of the Temple of Demeter at Eleusis.  It still exists there today ([photo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Cuirassed_bust_of_Marcus_Aurelius%2C_Eleusis_%2813945732075%29.jpg)).

Enchiridion 21,"“21. Let death and exile, and all other things which appear terrible be daily before your eyes, but chiefly death, and you will never entertain any abject thought, nor too eagerly covet anything.”

My own interpretation is the following:  
""It's hard to be a good person when no one is watching. But know that posterity always watches. When you understand that your body and belongings will be returned at some point, and together with your actions(the result of your thoughts) will be judged by posterity. Then you will always be motivated to do the right thing.""

I've been (is) worried about the state of the world - was told about Stoicism,"Hello. I have been doomscrolling throughout the internet. I've been keep reading bad news all over the world ever since europe warns citizens from Russia.

I have a problem with not knowing everything and I cannot accept it (right now).

I'm a father, kid is 1 years old, I love him to death. I wish nothing bad to ever happen to him (like every parent I hope). After all this war related stuff, i've been very depressed and I fear for the future.

I've been reading about Russia/Ukraine, NATO/Russia, North Korea threats, Iran building nukes, Israel/Gaza war, China/Taiwan. To a point where I just couldn't handle all the information and just broke.

&#x200B;

So i've come here, hoping to learn from you guys. I don't know much about stoicism but I read this simple definition of the term ""In simple terms, Stoicism **teaches us to focus on the things we can control—our thoughts, emotions, and actions—while accepting the things we cannot**, such as the actions of others or the natural course of events going on in the world around us.""

This is probably just what I need to learn in my life, but I don't know how to accept that this is what I need to do.

Thanks for reading.

Turning to you guys for help. Lost faith in life.,"Stoicism has helped me through many of my tough times but I’m out of it now, I’ve slipped into depression. 

This is why: I’m from a fairly lowly background and I dedicated my life to a career.  The idea was I would prove my worth by becoming successful through grit.  

Over the last few years:

One of my friends from a well-connected family got an offer from a friend - a connection.  He spent a lot of his life living like a playboy and now he’s leapfrogged me in career due to the network he has that I don’t. 

My other friend who didn’t graft like me is set in inherit money I would never dream of. 

My brother, who has spent a lot of his life avoiding hard work, has pushed a pretty weak medical negligence claim but will win more money than I’ll ever have and retire from it.  

My parents inherited all the family money and left nothing for us, spent it all on drugs and alcohol and on my brother.  

Now I am trapped working long hours in a hard career and I have less than all these people.  As I have to work hard my daughter is having issues in school.

The link between what I do and what I get is broken.  I’ve ended up with less than everyone but I did everything right.

I’m losing faith in life, everything.  I want to give up, it keeps happening. Everyone I know is ending up wealthy through fate and I’m stuck still with a mortgage, long hours etc. 

What was it all for?  I can’t stop as we will be impoverished.   Why did fate choose me to be the worker?  The other hilarious point is my earnings are taxed heavily but all their inheritance and claim is tax free, so I’m having to pay their taxes too. 

I know these are externals etc but I got to wake up at 5 every day and have health problems.  I got to have less time with kids. It’s not money, it’s my quality of life. 

I don’t have to be super rich and I don’t mind others good fortune but I feel like I’ve been conned.  It’s all mainly luck and God and fate seems to want to rub my nose in it.  It’s a good job I have kids otherwise after this happening so often I would want to check out of this corrupt and unfair world",Stoicism,1705813830.0,t3_19bvqaf,0.56,1

Years later,"Hi All, 28F looking for some advice here..

I grew up in a small town with a tight group of friends from elementary school through high school. Growing up, we were attached and all thought we’d be friends for the rest of our lives, in each others weddings etc. When we went off to college, we each went our separate ways, got jobs in different cities but stayed in contact thru social media, keeping each other up to date in a group message. At the time, I had gotten into a new relationship which eventually became toxic. I had made some new friends where I was studying/working and they knew about what was going on and what I was dealing with but I was so reluctant to tell my hometown friends about what I was going through.. I remember feeling embarrassed by the situation I was in. They all seemed happy and successful and I didn’t know how to communicate it. 3-4 months go by, (maybe more, I can’t remember exactly) where I don’t respond or update my life in this group message. One day I sign on and see that one of the girls removed me from the group. I remember a ton of emotions and at that time (6-7 years ago) I was still young and spite got over me, so I deleted all of my socia accounts which of course was wrong in hindsight. The first few months I felt pissed/angry and then as time went on, I felt an immense amount of guilt for never addressing it properly.  I’m at a point in my life where I know that we all moved on and that’s life, to accept it and I don’t feel as guilty as I did, considering no one reached out to me during one of the hardest times of my life to see how I was doing.

My feeling when I am unhappy in general,"Hello, dear friends! ❤️

I have very difficult situation..
I am unhappy now .. in everything..
I am confused und very tired emotionally in soul. 

A lot of different situations create responsibilities for me which I must to do. It is not fantasy, it is from reality. 
As example, to study German language every day from 7:30 - 16:30 on classic school in 14 faculties and after study it in integration course 17:00-19:15 Monday - Thursday.
After I have to do a lot of tests and exams in Bio/Chemie/History/German Literature/Ethik/Art/Informatik/Math/another subjects in school for grades minimum 4 - maximum 1-2. And I have to do general exam in B1 German from integration course in March.
And in Juni I have to do Exam from German History for integration.

In another side, I have to do a volunteer project in school because it is special  important program for to get grades for all students in 9 classes from 3 faculties - GRW, Deutsch, Ethik. It is a main responsibility inside school for everyone in 9 class.

And also I have to do a lot of homeworks in 14 faculties of school and in integration course. 

I have to go to doctors also at this time when I must to be in the lessons.

I have to send all documents for Jobcenter because of Bafög (Bafög is smaller for me then Burgergeld which I got earlier. I can not to pay for my flat by this money, and for food it is also not anough per month). I have to write in Email a lot about it for Jobcenter. I am tired also of it.

I have to have good grades in study. When grades will badly in study faculties or in exam of integration German, - in faculties I have to repeat 9 class once more, and in integration corse I have to pay new course to repeat last level of German language because it is new law which government of Germant created for Ukrainians in January 2024. It is a biggest stress.

In result...

I love in my heart English, study in English, work in profession in English (as a UI/UX Designer - 5 years, Front-End developer - 7 years). 
I love to paint illustrations in study materials also.
I love a lot to be as a mentor in developing software (have 2 years experience in this area).
But...
I can not to do it in Germany.. because they from government wanted from me to study German language and go to work which they want (not a developer, not a designer/illustrator). For designer/illustrator/developer in requirements for work in companies they need a lot of ""Ausbildung in Graphik/Kunst/Digital"" , ""B2 Deutsch"", ""Akademische Ausbildung"".
When I see it, I feel myself unhappy. 

I am cry today a lot when I opened German language book of integration because I have to do a lot of Homeworks of study it, and I really hate it now(o Got, I said it.. hope, the Germans will not hate me of this). 

Why I have to do things and processes in Germany which I don't like/hate/because another institutions want it?

I feel happy when I paint illustrations of study books/materials, when I teach development for somebody and believe in this person, when I see how my student goes to get win in study process and how he gets it with happy in his face, when I can develop software by myself, when I can do researchment and read / collect special data of research for create some functions in software.. 

But.. I can not to do it in Germany.. 
I have education in internet from Ukraine, not from Ausbildung in Deutschland.. it is not enough here for work and study, and study German language for my mind is more difficult as English.

I really love English with all my heart.. I also would like to teach English for German people as a teacher.. but this needs Uni/Studium of Teaching and special license of teaching (only according German standards of teaching)

When I understand this, I am cry once more..
I am confused.. 

What do you think, what will do in my place Aristoteles or Mark Aurelius?/or Kannt/ or Nicshe?

I am very grateful for your help..

Because today I am in a border of depression..

I know that I don't want to give my thoughts and time over to what I think others think of me (ofcourse, unless it is something that is right) because I know that it is not a good use of time.

Advice like ""life is too short for this"" and ""They don't think about you"", or ""You can't control their thoughts"", or ""It's all in your head"", are kind of useless when my reaction is automatic and my thoughts are buried in my subconsciousness.

I need some advice that I can try daily to combat my subconscious thoughts, and also in the moment. I need something that can change that automatic reaction.

Though I am aware of these thoughts in the moment, and even talk to myself in my head to reason with myself right at that moment I realise I am having these thoughts, I can't control the ""stiffness"" I feel when I feel as if they're staring at me, or judging me. I know all those aforementioned sentences are true, but they don't help at all during the moment, no matter how much I believe them to be true.

Am I doing this the right way? Does it just take some time to change these subconscious thoughts?",Stoicism,1705742403.0,t3_19b7xep,0.8,15
do I have to read the Introduction in meditations?,"I recently bought a copy of meditations from my local book store published by penguin and has a picture of a statue of Marcus Aurelius on the front. there is a rather lengthy introduction in the book by Diskin Clay and I dont feel as if I am getting much value from the introduction apart some history about Marcus. so am I able to just skip to the main part of the book labelled ""Meditations""?",Stoicism,1705794312.0,t3_19bphei,0.4,0
How to start,"Hey guys , I'm just starting to read about stoicism, just read some quotes and short videos but I don't know how to start applying stoicism in my life to help me , or where to read more about it , also how to actually apply stoicism to help me in addictions, like my phone , or how to help me become more disciplined in studying or training, or how to not get so affected with the outside world and all the disasters that's going on , I can't help but feel so much negativity, if can anyone who stoicism helped him with similar struggles share his stories and advice me what to do and how to do it , 

Thanks in advance.",Stoicism,1705760088.0,t3_19bcnre,0.78,5
My biggest life mistake was wanting to live an easy life,"2023 summons this the best, I didn’t want to exercise, diet, barely studied, barely did anything useful, expected my friend to do all the work for me, procrastinated a lot by saying that “tomorrow I start to do this”, got addicted to porn, tried to be a people pleaser (even going against some of my own believes), etc 

I regressed a lot as a person and what  were my rewards for wanting to live an easy life basically in autopilot with no logic and following just pure emotions ? Anxiety, memory issues, suicidal thoughts, weight gain, burnout, a lot of extra final exams that almost cost me a full semester, almost lost some of my friendships, i got way behind my peers and didn’t get my driver’s license 

Growing up I was never pushed/expected to do great things, if I was average that was enough for my parents and me, my mom basically did my homework for me, I would eat and watch tv all day and not leave the apartment and no one would care, so I never developed discipline, sense of urgency and maturity 

I have my ups and downs but basically to this day I lack those core elements and the 4 stoic principles 

With no temperance no self discipline nor control so I will waste my days with pleasurable things and just “do the important things tomorrow”, even tho nothing guarantees me a tomorrow

With no wisdom no intelligence and resourcefulness making me have bad grades at my college and be afraid to treat patients (I’m learning to be a dentist but I don’t reread core concepts such as anesthesia so I just ask my friend to do all the work for me at the clinic)

With no courage no scape from my comfort zone so I don’t try to improve myself 

With no justice I abandon my principles of wanting to be a good man and focus only on pleasing people and not strengthening or even developing a sense of character 

I hope that this serves me as an experience of what living a shallow existence is and how to always try to be better than yourself from yesterday (even if it takes baby steps)",Stoicism,1705691126.0,t3_19aqv6w,0.97,169
Following rules,"as a stoic i want to follow the rules. But what if the rules are set to be of questionable ethics.

perhaps the rules are enacted by an unintelligent dictator.

how should I act then? should I follow the rules or go against them to point out the stupidity (cynicism)?

all the best",Stoicism,1705750114.0,t3_19b9s9x,0.9,8
This Stoicism quote is appropriate for today's distracted world.,"I recently read a quote by Marcus Aurelius that has been stuck in my brain ever since. The quote is full of insight and has benefited me greatly in several aspects of my life. I'd want to share the quote with you all.

**If you seek tranquility, do less. Or (more accurately) do what’s essential. Do less, better. Because most of what we do or say is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you’ll have more tranquility. But to eliminate the necessary actions, we need to eliminate unnecessary assumptions as well.  — Marcus Aurelius**",Stoicism,1705717908.0,t3_19b13qg,0.89,31
