Presenting the Dharma on Social Media,"Please read this post entirely before responding in order to avoid any misunderstanding. I will try to make my intentions as clear as possible.

I am considering the possibility of setting up a social media channel in order to present the Dharma to anyone who stumbles upon it and is interested.

By 'presenting the Dharma' I specifically mean:
* Quoting Pali Canon Suttas and Mahayana Sutras.
* Mentioning useful books and online resources.
* Sharing personal experience (explicitly marked as being personal).

EDIT: I forgot to mention that I intentionally chose the word 'presenting' as in 'showing', 'sharing', 'replicating'. I am *not* speaking of *teaching* the Dharma.

I *do not* intend to do any of the following:
* Misrepresent myself as a qualified teacher.
* Misrepresent my personal views as Dharma.
* Attack other traditions or religions.
* Making money in any shape or form.
* Using unskillful methods to boost engagement (e.g. baiting people with false promises or intentionally evoking intense emotions).
* Criticizing people or trying to pressure, change or convert them.
* Engage in fruitless online discussions.
* Pursuing fame or recognition.
* Starting a new school, let alone a cult.

I am also well aware of what awaits me if I slander the Dharma or cause division in a Sangha.

In short, I intend to present the Dharma in accordance with the Dharma.

Please also note that I am not expecting anything from this. I am not emotionally attached to this project. I just want to use my abilities and means to do what's skillful.

Thanks for reading all of this. Here are my questions:
* **Is this a skillful thing to do at all?** If not, please just say so.
* **If so, did I miss anything that I should be aware of?**",Buddhism,1705842173.0,t3_19c2ypf,0.66,1

Feeling doomed after the realization of our endless cycle.,"After many years spent thinking about Buddha's teachings, suddenly, the realizations start to actually ""sink"" into my own perception: I am going in circles with endless rebirths. 

I feel overwhelmingly intimidated by this recently and so suddenly - even though I know the concept of rebirth and karma long ago since I was a child. Even as time (which is a product of our own construction) goes on, I feel as if it is merely an illusion.  I am ... stuck. 

It feels like the road we are traveling on (with occasional stops to refuel - rebirth) is endless and  that going further is pointless as it never stops. It is like the mirror which is shattered... but we still need it to see ourselves.

I know it sounds crazy but, how can I deal with this, fellow Buddhists? Thank you very much.

I asked the nun if I could make a donation; she led me upstairs to make an offering. After I had done that, we spoke for a minute and then she had to take a call.

request for advice regarding my practice,"Hello, my friends

I've Already decided on tibetan buddhism but it's tough for me to actually walk the path because of certain constraints I have. 

Due to the fact that I'm still a teenager, I don't really have the freedom to go to the tibetan-buddhist temples or centres in singapore. I also can't really spend any money on any malas, statues or online courses. Only thing I can really spend money on is books. I also don't really have the luxury of being able to study under a teacher right now.

Right now, how do I walk the path of tibetan-buddhism within these constraints? How do I learn meditation practices like tonglen, vipassana, shamantha and metta in a way that is true to my specific sect which is tibetan buddhism without spending any money on courses, online or in person? 

I do have full internet access but do bear in mind that even my access to tibetan buddhist books might be indirectly restricted due to my parents, who might not want me spending too much time on something like religion and/or who might be afraid that this distracts me from my studies.

Again, I need a structured practice but it's hard to do so with so little resources. Would appreciate any advice :)

It might be a long-shot unless you're super fluent in Pali, but could anyone possibly identify the extra verses that are added within the Sutta?

Connecting with Buddhists IRL when all centres nearby are controversial?,"Hi everyone, I just started getting into Buddhism and I'm very interested in developing my understanding of it! I have been going through the Tricycle beginner's course, meditating daily and starting to read more literature on the religion, its sects and practices. 

One thing I am struggling with is finding a sangha to connect with in person. I have been quite lonely for several months where I live, which is why I find it a bit important to find an IRL sangha.

I live in Newcastle upon Tyne, and I thought it would be easy to find a Buddhist temple/centre there, but they are all either Trinatra, NKT or Diamond Way. I have gone to one secular meditation event at the Trinatra centre, and the people seemed lovely, but I am sceptical of attending a centre which hasn't tried to disassociate from its controversial past.

There is a [temple](https://www.ratanagiri.org.uk/) an hour away by train which I might attend every first Sunday of the month.

Any other suggestions? Should I stay a bit more open-minded with the Triratna centre? What should I keep in mind and am I looking at this the wrong way?",Buddhism,1705783819.0,t3_19bljjf,0.73,6

The Valhalla,"[SN 42.3](https://suttacentral.net/sn42.3/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=sidenotes&highlight=true&script=latin)

Then Dustin the warrior chief went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:

‚ÄúSir, I have heard that the warriors of the past who were teachers of teachers said:
‚ÄòSuppose a warrior, while striving and struggling in battle, is killed and finished off by his foes. When his body breaks up, after death, he‚Äôs reborn in the company of the gods of the fallen.‚Äô
What does the Buddha say about this?‚Äù

‚ÄúEnough, chief, let it be. Don‚Äôt ask me that.‚Äù

For a second time ‚Ä¶

And for a third time the warrior chief said to the Buddha:

‚ÄúSir, I have heard that the warriors of the past who were teachers of teachers said:
‚ÄòSuppose a warrior, while striving and struggling in battle, is killed and finished off by his foes. When his body breaks up, after death, he‚Äôs reborn in the company of the gods of the fallen.‚Äô
What does the Buddha say about this?‚Äù

‚ÄúClearly, chief, I‚Äôm not getting through to you when I say:
‚ÄòEnough, chief, let it be. Don‚Äôt ask me that.‚Äô
Nevertheless, I will answer you.

When a warrior strives and struggles in battle, their mind is already low, degraded, and misdirected as they think:
‚ÄòMay these sentient beings be killed, slaughtered, slain, destroyed, or annihilated!‚Äô
His foes kill him and finish him off, and
when his body breaks up, after death, he‚Äôs reborn in the hell called ‚ÄòThe Fallen‚Äô.

But if you have such a view:
‚ÄòSuppose a warrior, while striving and struggling in battle, is killed and finished off by his foes. When his body breaks up, after death, he‚Äôs reborn in the company of the gods of the fallen.‚Äô This is your wrong view.
An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places, I say:
hell or the animal realm.‚Äù

When he said this, Dustin the warrior chief cried and burst out in tears.

‚ÄúThis is what I didn‚Äôt get through to you when I said:
‚ÄòEnough, chief, let it be. Don‚Äôt ask me that.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúSir, I‚Äôm not crying because of what the Buddha said.
But sir, for a long time I‚Äôve been cheated, tricked, and deceived by the warriors of the past who were teachers of teachers, who said:
‚ÄòSuppose a warrior, while striving and struggling in battle, is killed and finished off by his foes. When his body breaks up, after death, he‚Äôs reborn in the company of the gods of the fallen.‚Äô

Excellent, sir! Excellent!
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what‚Äôs there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways.
I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Sa·πÖgha.

Symbolism of ‚Äòwolves‚Äô and one‚Äôs energy ‚Äòfeeling as though it was from the earth‚Äô?,"
I went to a 7 day meditation retreat and my teachers repeatedly talked of the wolves they saw in me and which I may fee. Another symbol that was through in was that the way I shared felt very grounded and natural: ‚Äòearthy‚Äô is a word that came up a lot.

I have kind of ran through life with blinkers on having come from a ‚Äòtraumatic‚Äô history, but always forgetting about my past through distraction, giving into ‚Äòcravings‚Äô and busyness.

I would be eternally grateful if anyone could shine a light on what‚Äôs meant by the wolves I‚Äôm feeding and what they see as my nature appearing ‚Äòearthy‚Äô. I have struggled trying to find information from researching alone.

Happy to share more about experience/ background and what led me there, but don‚Äôt want to overwhelm and aware that I have been unskillful in my arrival to Buddhism out of sheer curiousity and spooky coincidences rather than mindfully or in a well thought concentrated manner.

i was always into self observation/reflection and diving deep into ourselves. im really into buddhism and meditation lately. i always had a LOT of thoughts about our consciouness, ego, being present and how our thoughts and state of mind affect our reality, i always discussed that with friends and almost all of my friends into hallucinogens said that they had those exact thoughts when tripping. i really wonder how far i could go when tripping if i do this when sober. also some of people i admire like ram dass, who researched it and used it a lot.  i wonder if it could benefit me, im really afraid of it causing problems, like that disorder, instead of helping me reach my goal. that happens to some people. i think i would go really paranoid about ""im still tripping, everythings not real"" if i had those hallucinations even when sober for like days, weeks, months. idk. i dont know if i should take a chance cause its worth or that could really f me up. im good where i am right now, i dont NEED those experiences, but i would really like to if they were good for me. what would you guys do?",Buddhism,1705738615.0,t3_19b70mq,0.73,29

How does your personal practice help others?,"Please read this post entirely before answering in order to avoid misunderstanding. I will try to be as clear as possible. Also, please don't read 'between the lines' because I don't think or write that way. Thank you!

In my limited experience, most Buddhist practices focus on liberating oneself. I have only recently begun my practice and have already noticed a significant, positive change, helping me to stay calm in previously stressful situations and allowing me to regain focus when I find myself trapped in unwholesome thoughts.

This change in my behavior also seems to slightly positively effect people in my surroundings. Since I am a beginner and have little knowledge and experience, this observation has led me to the following question:

How does *your personal* practice help other people?

Please note the following clarifications:

* I am explicitly asking about *your personal* practice, i.e. the way you as an individual choose to apply Buddhist teachings. Please respect everyone's personal accounts and focus on what's uniting instead of looking for aspects that divide.

* This is a question meant exactly as it is worded. It is *not* a judgemental statement or an attempt to manipulate, convince, criticize, blame, misrepresent, divide or anything else unwholesome.

* I am also not talking about wanting to change others, converting others to Buddhism or unsolicitedly pestering them. This question is aimed solely at your perspective and experience.

* This question is not about me! I'm happy with my practice and I strive to learn more and improve. I am *not* in distress, I am just curious and like to hear from others!

* Once again, this question is not meant to *imply* anything! I believe that one's practice mainly needs to focus on oneself and should not depend on others.

I am merely asking because I noticed this effect in my personal practice and was wondering if you experienced something similar (or maybe something completely different).

Looking for a particular type of book,"I used to have a little library of Buddhist books that I would recommend to others.

I would love to give a book about Buddhism to an elderly woman I know who I'd very spiritual. She is actually a Christian. I don't want to convert her. I just think she could benefit from some of the teachings about living in the here and now. She doesn't have any awareness of the concept of choosing her focus, of attachment as a concept, of our relationship to expectations, or of letting go of things that bring us suffering. 

I don't know if she will be interested. She is not much of a reader. But I think it would be a meaningful gift that she might read out of curiosity if I gave it to her.

request for advice regarding my practice,"Hello, my friends

I've Already decided on tibetan buddhism but it's tough for me to actually walk the path because of certain constraints I have. 

Due to the fact that I'm still a teenager, I don't really have the freedom to go to the tibetan-buddhist temples or centres in singapore. I also can't really spend any money on any malas, statues or online courses. Only thing I can really spend money on is books. I also don't really have the luxury of being able to study under a teacher right now.

Right now, how do I walk the path of tibetan-buddhism within these constraints? How do I learn meditation practices like tonglen, vipassana, shamantha and metta in a way that is true to my specific sect which is tibetan buddhism without spending any money on courses, online or in person? 

I do have full internet access but do bear in mind that even my access to tibetan buddhist books might be indirectly restricted due to my parents, who might not want me spending too much time on something like religion and/or who might be afraid that this distracts me from my studies.

Again, I need a structured practice but it's hard to do so with so little resources. Would appreciate any advice :)

Presenting the Dharma on Social Media,"Please read this post entirely before responding in order to avoid any misunderstanding. I will try to make my intentions as clear as possible.

I am considering the possibility of setting up a social media channel in order to present the Dharma to anyone who stumbles upon it and is interested.

By 'presenting the Dharma' I specifically mean:
* Quoting Pali Canon Suttas and Mahayana Sutras.
* Mentioning useful books and online resources.
* Sharing personal experience (explicitly marked as being personal).

EDIT: I forgot to mention that I intentionally chose the word 'presenting' as in 'showing', 'sharing', 'replicating'. I am *not* speaking of *teaching* the Dharma.

I *do not* intend to do any of the following:
* Misrepresent myself as a qualified teacher.
* Misrepresent my personal views as Dharma.
* Attack other traditions or religions.
* Making money in any shape or form.
* Using unskillful methods to boost engagement (e.g. baiting people with false promises or intentionally evoking intense emotions).
* Criticizing people or trying to pressure, change or convert them.
* Engage in fruitless online discussions.
* Pursuing fame or recognition.
* Starting a new school, let alone a cult.

I am also well aware of what awaits me if I slander the Dharma or cause division in a Sangha.

In short, I intend to present the Dharma in accordance with the Dharma.

Please also note that I am not expecting anything from this. I am not emotionally attached to this project. I just want to use my abilities and means to do what's skillful.

Buddhisms view on Electronics and Mirrors,"So i think in the new age spiritual philosophy electronics are seen as problematic and to be treated with caution. I can see why, one can easily get lost in media and the comfort of machines that do everything, but with an old tradition like buddhism these things didnt exist back in the day. Is there a clear view on these things from a buddhist perspective, are they just another layer of maya ? nothing more then material illusions ?

Another question i have is that of how mirrors are seen. in the european thought the view in mirrors mostly seems to come from the mythos of narcissus who falls in love with his own redlection and drowns in the water in which he sees his reflection, we still call people narcistic who keep looking at their reflection.

Feeling doomed after the realization of our endless cycle.,"After many years spent thinking about Buddha's teachings, suddenly, the realizations start to actually ""sink"" into my own perception: I am going in circles with endless rebirths. 

I feel overwhelmingly intimidated by this recently and so suddenly - even though I know the concept of rebirth and karma long ago since I was a child. Even as time (which is a product of our own construction) goes on, I feel as if it is merely an illusion.  I am ... stuck. 

It feels like the road we are traveling on (with occasional stops to refuel - rebirth) is endless and  that going further is pointless as it never stops. It is like the mirror which is shattered... but we still need it to see ourselves.

I know it sounds crazy but, how can I deal with this, fellow Buddhists? Thank you very much.

Then Dustin the warrior chief went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:

‚ÄúSir, I have heard that the warriors of the past who were teachers of teachers said:
‚ÄòSuppose a warrior, while striving and struggling in battle, is killed and finished off by his foes. When his body breaks up, after death, he‚Äôs reborn in the company of the gods of the fallen.‚Äô
What does the Buddha say about this?‚Äù

‚ÄúEnough, chief, let it be. Don‚Äôt ask me that.‚Äù

For a second time ‚Ä¶

And for a third time the warrior chief said to the Buddha:

‚ÄúSir, I have heard that the warriors of the past who were teachers of teachers said:
‚ÄòSuppose a warrior, while striving and struggling in battle, is killed and finished off by his foes. When his body breaks up, after death, he‚Äôs reborn in the company of the gods of the fallen.‚Äô
What does the Buddha say about this?‚Äù

‚ÄúClearly, chief, I‚Äôm not getting through to you when I say:
‚ÄòEnough, chief, let it be. Don‚Äôt ask me that.‚Äô
Nevertheless, I will answer you.

When a warrior strives and struggles in battle, their mind is already low, degraded, and misdirected as they think:
‚ÄòMay these sentient beings be killed, slaughtered, slain, destroyed, or annihilated!‚Äô
His foes kill him and finish him off, and
when his body breaks up, after death, he‚Äôs reborn in the hell called ‚ÄòThe Fallen‚Äô.

But if you have such a view:
‚ÄòSuppose a warrior, while striving and struggling in battle, is killed and finished off by his foes. When his body breaks up, after death, he‚Äôs reborn in the company of the gods of the fallen.‚Äô This is your wrong view.
An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places, I say:
hell or the animal realm.‚Äù

When he said this, Dustin the warrior chief cried and burst out in tears.

‚ÄúThis is what I didn‚Äôt get through to you when I said:
‚ÄòEnough, chief, let it be. Don‚Äôt ask me that.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúSir, I‚Äôm not crying because of what the Buddha said.
But sir, for a long time I‚Äôve been cheated, tricked, and deceived by the warriors of the past who were teachers of teachers, who said:
‚ÄòSuppose a warrior, while striving and struggling in battle, is killed and finished off by his foes. When his body breaks up, after death, he‚Äôs reborn in the company of the gods of the fallen.‚Äô

Excellent, sir! Excellent!
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what‚Äôs there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways.
I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Sa·πÖgha.

How does your personal practice help others?,"Please read this post entirely before answering in order to avoid misunderstanding. I will try to be as clear as possible. Also, please don't read 'between the lines' because I don't think or write that way. Thank you!

In my limited experience, most Buddhist practices focus on liberating oneself. I have only recently begun my practice and have already noticed a significant, positive change, helping me to stay calm in previously stressful situations and allowing me to regain focus when I find myself trapped in unwholesome thoughts.

This change in my behavior also seems to slightly positively effect people in my surroundings. Since I am a beginner and have little knowledge and experience, this observation has led me to the following question:

How does *your personal* practice help other people?

Please note the following clarifications:

* I am explicitly asking about *your personal* practice, i.e. the way you as an individual choose to apply Buddhist teachings. Please respect everyone's personal accounts and focus on what's uniting instead of looking for aspects that divide.

* This is a question meant exactly as it is worded. It is *not* a judgemental statement or an attempt to manipulate, convince, criticize, blame, misrepresent, divide or anything else unwholesome.

* I am also not talking about wanting to change others, converting others to Buddhism or unsolicitedly pestering them. This question is aimed solely at your perspective and experience.

* This question is not about me! I'm happy with my practice and I strive to learn more and improve. I am *not* in distress, I am just curious and like to hear from others!

* Once again, this question is not meant to *imply* anything! I believe that one's practice mainly needs to focus on oneself and should not depend on others.

I am merely asking because I noticed this effect in my personal practice and was wondering if you experienced something similar (or maybe something completely different).

"I'm 29, Severely Disabled, And My Mom Has Tumors (Just Learned They're Benign! :D). Buddhism Is Helping.","Today I heard my mother was sick and I cried like a baby. But, after listening to videos and redditting about Buddhism for a month or so, I've built a certain detachment from suffering, and so I stopped the crying the same day. We then learned that her tumors are benign and will likely never give her cancer. Before I stopped the crying I was making deals with my old God: ""Please, I'll enter the church just spare her!"", but it was pointless to hold on to a hopless cause, she'll pass away far in the future, but she will pass away, no matter how much I love my family, they will all leave this world, and I will to. My grandfather passed away about nine years ago, and he brings warm memories whenever he comes back into my thoughts. I loved him so much, and I lost him, but he's in another life now, and he died a changed, good man. I can only hope for my family to build a temple of good Karma in their lives so that they find an end to suffering, and I wish the same for myself. I will not find inner peace during suffering in my attachments, but in being aware of everything, and being aware of everything being connected to everything else, that all life is eternal, in the arms of eternal wisdom.

Thinking of converting from Nihilism to Buddhism,"Just like the title says. I think I want to become Buddhist, but I have no idea where to begin. At least I want to study what it entails more in-depth than what I learned in my high school world history class. Help would be greatly appreciated

My story: I was originally raised southern baptist Christian in the Bible Belt. There were good people in the 2-3 churches I attended throughout my childhood, but Christianity just always made me feel uncomfortable throughout life and many people were very judgmental // condescending. It always felt like some sort of cult. Especially with the influence it holds here in the United States.

Since I became an ‚Äúadult‚Äù and graduated high school and went off to college, I‚Äôve been kind of lost and wandering with my spirituality. I considered myself agnostic at this point. Going back to Christianity crossed my mind many times and I tried other churches, but it always just left a bad taste in my mouth. So then I heard about and tried self-guided Christianity. Couldn‚Äôt come to terms with that either. So eventually I came to this mindset that what if just absolutely nothing happened after death. Like poof just blackness. Nothingness. I eventually learned afterwards that was called nihilism and that there were two types: the ‚Äújust don‚Äôt try‚Äù kind and the ‚Äúmake the most of what you‚Äôve got‚Äù kind. Safe to say I stuck to the second one. This has worked the best for me, but it still feels like there‚Äôs gotta be something. Like I don‚Äôt believe that people don‚Äôt have spirits, and that directly contrasts with nihilism. I just don‚Äôt know what to believe about what happens with said spirits. This is where my idea of maybe the whole reincarnation thing with Buddhism might work as a faith for me.

Idk I guess I just want to be able to believe that all it really takes is being a nice/good person and not being a POS to others is all it takes for good to come to you. I want a faith to believe, I want to know if Buddhism can work for me, and I would love any suggestions on where to start if so. Thanks much!",Buddhism,1705712810.0,t3_19azd8f,0.78,7

"Question on Pureland, Amitabha, and Handheld Tibetan Prayer Wheels","So, I have questions. I wanted to question the validity of some statements too.

1. This video: https://youtu.be/vjW82VJXkQY?si=ZzwGyvcxGxjK1sUJ&t=543 it states that if you were to think up this Buddha (Amitabha) or simply call upon the name of this Buddha, even 10 times, they‚Äôll be able to attain rebirth in the pureland in their next life. Is that true? Does this have to be done daily or? Just recite his name 10 times once?

2. In the book The Wheel of Great Compassion by Larne Ladner and Lama Zopa Rinpoche, on page viii, it says, ‚ÄúThey gave me one, and I offered it to the king of Nepal. The Nepalese king asked me whether he should keep it. I said ‚ÄúYes, and if you have this prayer wheel next to you at the time of death, then your consciousness will be reborn in a pure land of Buddha.‚Äù‚Äù My question is: is that true? If you have a prayer wheel with you at the time of death, you‚Äôll be born in a pure land of Buddha? Which Buddha?

3. Will recitation of Amitabha‚Äôs name conflict with if you have a Tibetan Prayer Wheel with you at the time of death? Will it be possible to recite Amitabha‚Äôs name 10 times, have a prayer wheel with you at the time of death, and then be born into another Buddha‚Äôs pureland?",Buddhism,1705706330.0,t3_19awx8t,0.86,5
Review of From Here to Enlightenment: an Introduction to Tsongkhapa's Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment,"Review of From Here to Enlightenment: an Introduction to Tsongkhapa's Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment

Hello, here are my thoughts on this book. Don't get upset.

The reason I put that sort of obvious title is because that is something you should know about this book. It is the Dalai Lama explaining the aforementioned text. He says it is his main guide and he likes it very much. I like his explanations of it very much too. The Dalai Lama here writes very clearly and what you should do and what is necessary to attain enlightenment and details the steps and practices and philosophies. It is more directive than some of his other texts, by which I mean that in this text he tells you what to do, while in others he just examines what is good etc. One last thing you should know is that he has written several books examining Tsongkhapa's works. Tsongkhapa made the small, medium, and great treatises, and I think the Dalai Lama wrote books on each of those, maybe several books on each. My point there is that many of his books deal with the same subject, so you might want to pick the best one, instead of reading all.
