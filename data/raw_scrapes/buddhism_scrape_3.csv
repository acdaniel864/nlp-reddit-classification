Do enlightened beings emanate form(s) that are conditioned?,"I‚Äôm trying to understand this, I read somewhere that, at least in Mahayana, by my understanding, the enlightened beings continue to emanate bodies (or a body) after realising nirvana. But since nirvana is unconditioned, and samsara is conditioned and has dependent origination, do the enlightened ones emanate forms that are conditioned or are they unconditioned, unbound by rules of samsara? Please correct me if my understanding is not clear, thank you",Buddhism,1705842853.0,t3_19c35t6,0.6,1
Presenting the Dharma on Social Media,"Please read this post entirely before responding in order to avoid any misunderstanding. I will try to make my intentions as clear as possible.

I am considering the possibility of setting up a social media channel in order to present the Dharma to anyone who stumbles upon it and is interested.

By 'presenting the Dharma' I specifically mean:
* Quoting Pali Canon Suttas and Mahayana Sutras.
* Mentioning useful books and online resources.
* Sharing personal experience (explicitly marked as being personal).

EDIT: I forgot to mention that I intentionally chose the word 'presenting' as in 'showing', 'sharing', 'replicating'. I am *not* speaking of *teaching* the Dharma.

I *do not* intend to do any of the following:
* Misrepresent myself as a qualified teacher.
* Misrepresent my personal views as Dharma.
* Attack other traditions or religions.
* Making money in any shape or form.
* Using unskillful methods to boost engagement (e.g. baiting people with false promises or intentionally evoking intense emotions).
* Criticizing people or trying to pressure, change or convert them.
* Engage in fruitless online discussions.
* Pursuing fame or recognition.
* Starting a new school, let alone a cult.

I am also well aware of what awaits me if I slander the Dharma or cause division in a Sangha.

In short, I intend to present the Dharma in accordance with the Dharma.

Please also note that I am not expecting anything from this. I am not emotionally attached to this project. I just want to use my abilities and means to do what's skillful.

Thanks for reading all of this. Here are my questions:
* **Is this a skillful thing to do at all?** If not, please just say so.
* **If so, did I miss anything that I should be aware of?**",Buddhism,1705842173.0,t3_19c2ypf,0.66,1

Feeling doomed after the realization of our endless cycle.,"After many years spent thinking about Buddha's teachings, suddenly, the realizations start to actually ""sink"" into my own perception: I am going in circles with endless rebirths. 

I feel overwhelmingly intimidated by this recently and so suddenly - even though I know the concept of rebirth and karma long ago since I was a child. Even as time (which is a product of our own construction) goes on, I feel as if it is merely an illusion.  I am ... stuck. 

It feels like the road we are traveling on (with occasional stops to refuel - rebirth) is endless and  that going further is pointless as it never stops. It is like the mirror which is shattered... but we still need it to see ourselves.

I know it sounds crazy but, how can I deal with this, fellow Buddhists? Thank you very much.

I work with a volunteer group, and today we did a drive in collaboration with the local Buddhist temple. Since I began practice last summer I've been largely self-taught, so I saw this as a great opportunity.

I asked the nun if I could make a donation; she led me upstairs to make an offering. After I had done that, we spoke for a minute and then she had to take a call. While on the phone, she went to the altar where two bowls of apples were situated, took two of the apples, and gave them to me. Then I went downstairs.

request for advice regarding my practice,"Hello, my friends

I've Already decided on tibetan buddhism but it's tough for me to actually walk the path because of certain constraints I have. 

Due to the fact that I'm still a teenager, I don't really have the freedom to go to the tibetan-buddhist temples or centres in singapore. I also can't really spend any money on any malas, statues or online courses. Only thing I can really spend money on is books. I also don't really have the luxury of being able to study under a teacher right now.

Right now, how do I walk the path of tibetan-buddhism within these constraints? How do I learn meditation practices like tonglen, vipassana, shamantha and metta in a way that is true to my specific sect which is tibetan buddhism without spending any money on courses, online or in person? 

I do have full internet access but do bear in mind that even my access to tibetan buddhist books might be indirectly restricted due to my parents, who might not want me spending too much time on something like religion and/or who might be afraid that this distracts me from my studies.

Again, I need a structured practice but it's hard to do so with so little resources. Would appreciate any advice :)

Buddhisms view on Electronics and Mirrors,"So i think in the new age spiritual philosophy electronics are seen as problematic and to be treated with caution. I can see why, one can easily get lost in media and the comfort of machines that do everything, but with an old tradition like buddhism these things didnt exist back in the day. Is there a clear view on these things from a buddhist perspective, are they just another layer of maya ? nothing more then material illusions ?

Another question i have is that of how mirrors are seen. in the european thought the view in mirrors mostly seems to come from the mythos of narcissus who falls in love with his own redlection and drowns in the water in which he sees his reflection, we still call people narcistic who keep looking at their reflection. Is there from a buddhist view a reason to avoid looking at oneself in the mirror ? of course a mirror shows you a body that you inhabit, but i think there is another layer of self realisation in it, as some animals and young humans can recognize a body in a mirror, but not themselves.

"SGI's President Ikeda's ultimate aim to ""realize Soka Kingdom""","Many people are deceived (or even prefer) to only see the ""bright shiny - everything is wonderful"" side that organizations work incessantly to show to prospective members and followers.  Before making any decisions regarding joining, remaining, or leaving a religious organization, it is a good idea to first do some independent in-depth research on the past history of the organization and its leader(s).  This pragmatic step is necessary to offset dogma and propaganda generated by religious organizations designed to entice enrollment and donations, and is an especially crucial step to take with organizations that have degenerated into using cult dynamics.  Religious cults are very adept at employing subtle mind control techniques while deftly covering up their unsavory histories and ulterior agendas from members or from public scrutiny.  With that in mind, the SGI and it's president for the last 54 years, Mr. Ikeda, deserve a much closer look.  

Ikeda's SGI claims to be a benevolent religious organization seeking only to spread Nichiren Buddhism and World Peace. However, researching historical archives plainly reveals Ikeda's hidden goal of creating a ""Soka Kingdom"", while placing himself as a monarchical ruler over his kingdom, and, generates substantial doubts regarding their claims of innocent benevolence.   

Let's examine his own incriminating words to discern the true nature and goals of the self-proclaimed fascist monarch, King Ikeda. Below are some very revealing quotes regarding ""Realizing the Soka Kingdom"" from the megalomaniac himself.

Quotes from SGI President Ikeda:

ON SOKA DOMINATION;
"" We must place the Soka Gakkai members in all the key positions of Japanese government and society. Otherwise Kosenrufu (world peace) will not be accomplished. ""
September 6th 1957, Seikyo Shimbun ( SG's daily organ newspaper )

ON TAKING OVER JAPAN
"" I feel the time to take over Japan has come close. A party that can't take the rein of the government need not exist. But don't worry. Here, I am behind the (Komei) party. ""
November 16th 1976, Photo gathering with members of the SGI's Komei political party

ON BECOMING KING & DISCARDING SGI
"" What I learned (from the second president Toda) is how to behave as a monarch. I shall be a man of the greatest power. The Soka Gakkai may be disbanded then. "" (The Soka Gakkai is just an instrument for Ikeda power quest.)
July 1970 issue of Japanese monthly magazine ""Gendai"" (English: the present age)

ON CONTROLLING THE ECONOMY
"" In the process of (our) Kosenrufu activity, the SG political party (Komei), the SG schools, the Bunka (SG's cultural organization), and the Minon (SG's entertainment business organization) have been founded. The last yet unaccomplished (revolution) is the economy. From now on, we members of the Shachokai (a group which consists of CEOs from Soka Gakkai front companies) shall create an economic revolution. ""
June 25th 1967, the 1st Shachokai meeting

ON POWER PLAY
"" Extend our power inconspicuously, set up networks in the industrial world.""  
"" Yasuhiro Nakasone (former Japanese Prime Minister) is not a significant matter. He is just a boy on our side. When he asked me to help make him Japanese Prime Minister, I said "" Okay, Okay, I'll let you be a Prime Minister. ""
November 25th 1967, the 6th Shachokai meeting

ON POLICE CORRUPTION
"" My men manipulating (the) police are Takeiri and Inoue. ""
July 8th 1968, the 13th Shachokai meeting

ON BEING GOD/KING
""To found the Soka Nation, the Soka Kingdom, on earth, in the universe, I shall protect Soka Gakkai members.""
The Second Head Quarter Meeting in Tokyo, June 10 1975

ON LOVE OF FASCISM (combined state & corporate power)
""To tell the truth, fascism is my real ideal.""
The 61st Executives Meeting, June 15 1972

ON BEING ABLE TO CONQUER JAPAN
"" The Soka Gakkai would then be dissolved. ""
July 1970 issue of Japanese monthly magazine ""Gendai""

ON MISUSING TEMPLE AS MASK TO DISGUISE SGI AS TRADITIONAL BUDDHISM
""The main temple Taisekiji is a sacrifice for the Soka Gakkai. The Soka Gakkai is most important of all. ""
The second Headquarter Meeting in Tokyo, June 10 1975


In short, the Soka Gakkai's (under Ikeda's control since 1960) unscrupulous ambitions are an attempt to completely rule Japan (and possibly an effort to create a template for future use to eventually dominate other nations as well) in a multifaceted way.

That is,

1. Spiritually: Make all the Japanese belong to Soka Gakkai.

2. Politically: Have the SG's Komei Party take the rein of the Japanese government.

3. Economically: Have business enterprises affiliated with Soka Gakkai control Japanese financial circles.

4. Have Soka Gakkai members slip into key positions of Japanese society, including administrative organs, the Ministry of Justice, the media, educational organizations, cultural organizations, etc., then take control of Japan.

5. Then finally, Daisaku Ikeda will become a man of absolute power to rule Japan.

Ikeda's ambitions are not merely big talk by a megalomaniac. Actually, the Soka Gakkia's own political force, the Komei-to Party (thanks in part to its merger with another party) has become the the most powerful party in the Japanese Diet's House of Representatives - its increased success is in direct proportion to the increase of millions of Soka Gakkai members. Elite individuals, who are members of the Soka Gakkai such as lawyers, prosecutors, judges, accountants, policemen, diplomats, government officials, etc., have already penetrated into Japanese society. The number of those elites has continuously increased. Ikeda and the Soka Gakkai's plot to take over Japan has been advancing steadily so far.


The ugly truth is this: ""The Soka Kingdom"" comprises a terrible fascist nation. The ultimate cruelty is that Ikeda's followers, and even his organization are considered by him to be disposable in his quest to rule his kingdom. Building and maintaining power and control is what is most important to a despotic king.  

Ikeda's ""Soka Kingdom"" aims at realizing a dictatorship nation based on fascism with Ikeda wearing the dictator's crown.  There are many well-documented criminal acts committed by the Soka Gakkai, including the oppression of the freedom of publishing, the spurious substitution of votes, the wire tapping incident, the Recruit bribery case, The Jari Senpaku bribery case, and many more. If the Soka Gakkai's goals of taking over the government were to be fully realized, the use of violence, corruption, and injustice would be justified to protect the dictator Ikeda's privileges, honor, wealth, and his power.

This terrible plot, ""Realizing the Soka Kingdom"" can be said to be the ultimate goal that Ikeda and the Soka Gakkai, under a mask of religion, have been aiming at all along. Furthermore, the existence of the Soka Gakkai, for the fascist despot Ikeda is, after all, just a tool or base to take over the rein of the government.

Here is a man that is revered as the modern-day Buddha by his disciples.  But based solely on his own words, it becomes crystal clear - IKEDA IS THE OVERLY AMBITIOUS TYRANT KING OF HIS EXPANDING 'SOKA KINGDOM', WHOSE TRUE OBJECTIVE IS TO BECOME A DESPOTIC RULER OVER A FASCIST JAPANESE GOVERNMENT. 

No need to take my word on this.  Read the quotes. Do your own independent research on Ikeda, the SGI, and what ""Realizing the Soka Kingdom"" means for the nation of Japan. Check out the unexpected turn toward fascism and war that is happening right now within the Japanese government whose Constitution prohibits Japan from waging war. Free speech is under a serious repressive attack by the right wing government in the wake of the Fukushima scandal.  The movement to return Japan to fascism is quickly gaining ground.  Find out who (or what political party) is generating this movement to fascism.  Think about the dire consequences that happened to Japan and the world last time it embraced fascism. Form your own opinions, and make up your own mind.  Remain independent - do not rely on SGI doctrine to uncover the hidden facts and figures (for instance, as a member, you will not hear this fact from the cult.org - the SGI pulls in around 2 billion dollars a year!).  If you are content to continue on with the SGI regardless of the hidden past or the buried facts - fine.  

But if you have doubts or reservations, please remain extremely cautious of any covert or overt influence or pressure on you to join or remain committed to the SGI.  Do your research. Carefully re-evaluate / re-assess your own relationship with the organization and it's cultish demands for members to declare Ikeda as their personal mentor (master). IF you have not ceded your ability to think for yourself to this power/control hungry cult, you may have a lot to gain and little to lose by acknowledging your intuitive ""second thoughts"" about becoming or remaining a member of this rich, powerful, and control-obsessed organization.  Nothing in life is cost-free. Those so-called fantastic benefits that are so loudly touted and advertised at introduction meetings don't come without a high price to pay. Buyer beware! Remember the old adage, ""if its too good to be true - it probably is.""        


An un-enslaved spirit... 

This post is intended to establish published quotes and facts, generate thoughtful discussion, and function as both a warning and a wake up call to those exposed to or under the influence of the SGI's powerful propaganda machine.  Sometimes the truth is very difficult to accept. It was for me. As Mark Twain famously said, ""It is much easier to fool human beings than to convince them they have been fooled.""  Legitimate on topic discussion and questions are always welcome.  Thanks.

I need honest opinions about my pregnancy loss story,"TW: Pregnancy Loss no follow up scans

What is your opinion on this story?

How should I view this situation? 

Please. I genuinely need to talk to some people here. 

I love my partner very much. We have been together for years 

My long term partner found out she was pregnant

She was having seriously bad cramping for a few days and then some normal pregnancy spotting.

She went to an unplanned sexual health clinic at 7 weeks but was told the embryo was 6 weeks and had no heartbeat.. was offered induced medical miscarriage pills and she took them after only one scan. No follow up scans. 

I don't know how I should feel.

She told me she would never have done it if there was a heartbeat ( the ultrasound showed no heartbeat )

Part of me feels that we could have waited longer to take the pills just incase..and that we should have followed up as ive heard it CAN be too early to confirm at 6-7 weeks if they see a HB.

I am in shock.. 

She was in a lot of pain... How should I view this situation? 

I can't live with myself if I know we ended the pregnancy but she said she felt ok taking the pills cos there was no heartbeat found on the ultrasound at 6 weeks when she was 7 weeks since LMP

There was no heavy bleeding but there was a lot of pain ( stronger than period cramps ) 

She seems absolutely fine..but I'm in turmoil. That was my child too.

She says she was in pain and that there was no heartbeat at the ultrasound and she would not have carried on if she had found out it had a heartbeat.

Was she morally justified to take these pills given the information she was presented but this was at a private clinic not a doctor's office? There was no follow up.

Honestly I love this girl but this changed me. I'm anxious 24/7 now.

Is marijuana intoxicating?,"I think our initial intuition to this question says, ""Yes, obviously,"" but there's something different about marijuana (and lsd and psilocybin for that matter). The difference is that marijuana is not toxic. 

I think the initial intuition regarding the fifth precept is that we should refrain things that impair our facilities of mind. Now, there is literature which suggests that marijuana impairs short term memory, but maybe we're not seeing the effects of marijuana ""intoxication"" as they really are.

The main point that leads me to wonder that marijuana might not be intoxicating is that marijuana is not toxic.

Push for diversity in Western Buddhism is missing the point of Buddhism in my opinion,"lionsroar has been putting out these articles about inclusion in Western Buddhism.  Here is an example:

 [https://www.lionsroar.com/the-infrastructure-of-inclusion/](https://www.lionsroar.com/the-infrastructure-of-inclusion/) 

A quote from the article:

"" This practice of radical inclusivity requires robust feedback loops that promote active, intentional learning efforts. For example, when we noticed that POC attendance percentages were falling, POC community members felt that we needed to support white practitioners to develop skills for navigating a diverse sangha. This led to a six-month class series for white folks that is now in its fifth year. We are also turning our attention to the unique impact of patriarchy, so as to develop programs that incorporate a more complex understanding of intersectionality. ""

To me, this is kind of Western super liberal politically correct nonsense that has nothing to do with Buddhist teachings.  By tracking and then trying to solve the ""problem"" of POC attendance, you are just strengthening an attachment to self.  Someone's race, gender, or sexual orientation becomes their identity and whatever group they fall into is more important than anything else.  

I want a Sangha to be completely open to different races, sexualities, genders, etc.  But to make a point of tracking attendance metrics and worrying about if they are hitting some made up quota of what a diverse Sangha should look like is completely missing the point.  Why can't you just go to a meditation meeting without focusing on what groups people may fall into?  If someone wants to bring up specific problems relating to their own race, gender, sexual identity, etc. that is great and it should be discussed.  But don't make it some sort of necessity because you have ideas about society and how things should be.",Buddhism,1568567663.0,t3_d4ncyc,0.56,6

Most texts are translated and the centers look modern/simple (not traditional). There are about 640 groups and centers around the world, most of them in Europe.

There are articles and discussions about Lama Ole that criticize a few things. Key parts are his strong criticism against Islam, watering down the teachings into ""party buddhism"", his training in the teachings (not academic or 3 year retreat), isolation of the groups.

In 2019 there was an incident in Germany about excluding the group from the DBU (German Buddhist Union) following statements of Lama Ole. Example (translated):

""I can tell you: Too much Islam and our freedom is gone. They attack the women first, you know that, clitoris off and so on and all the other things that are done to women. And then all the other things come, don't they. That they are beaten, that twelve-year-old girls are married off to sixty-year-old neighbors and all that different stuff.""

For context there are many students of Lama Ole that have difficult circumstances with muslims. Many want advice about it and are searching for solutions. His usual advice is to inform yourself about the koran, islamic history and islamic societies. 

Following the discussions about the exclusion, the organization resigned from the DBU.

In this subreddit I could mostly find criticism about Diamond Way. Its not actively discussed other then being called a cult whenever somebody is searching for a buddhist group. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/up5lj0/trouble\_finding\_a\_centersupport\_group/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/up5lj0/trouble_finding_a_centersupport_group/)

I had a good exchange in this thread 18 days ago, about my issue with that.

Other than that I could find a few posts and comments with only negative comments.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/rppl34/diamond\_way\_centers\_and\_idolatry/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/rppl34/diamond_way_centers_and_idolatry/)

The Diamond Way community is obviously not very active on this sub. I can understand that. Most of what I find here is very one sided. It is like an accumulation of all negative one can see or interpret. Even from an outside perspective Diamond Way is very successful. Through the many centers and activities of Lama Ole, easily a hundred thousand people in the west took refuge. Today thousands are active practitioners that visit the centers regularly and practice the Guru Yoga of the 16th Karmapa. Of course I can't tell how everybody is doing on their way. But from what I observed people get more compassionate and wise. I have seen many people change their difficult life. They get very idealistic and try to make use of buddhist practice wherever they are. Even more people don't practice but are touched by the activity of Lama Ole and his students. For many it is an easy possibility to hear about the buddha and his teachings. Some may not like the style or the people but we try to show the compassion and wisdom of buddhism. If somebody doesn't fit, there are many more buddhist groups in the west, as we all can see in this sub. 

The most important fact is Diamond Way and Lama Ole Nydahl are under the patronage of Karmapa Trinley Thaye Dorje. There is active exchange between Diamond Way and other organizations under the Karmapa. Things are changing organically (for example there is no alcohol allowed in the centers anymore) and Lama Ole and the organization represent most of the lay buddhists under the Karmapa. 

I think it boils down to some acceptance between the Karmapa candidates. In the past there was a lot of tension between the two sides. Both candidates want to mend the wounds of that. I think a part of this is to accept each other. I think going around and talking that the other side is not really buddhist is not very useful. My thought is that we should see the merits both sides have and continue on our path. Of course that doesn't mean I only want to read bad things others think about my teacher. 

So my question is:

The acceptance of the mixing of Buddhism with Christianity,"I get it. Christianity is the dominant religion in the west. But i am also an ex christian who has seen too much. I cannot agree with the mixing of a religion that has caused so much pain and suffering with one that teaches you to overcome pain and suffering. I know many people compare Jesus to Buddha, but good people dont get crucified. I know ill get some flak for this, but i disagree with That Nich Hahn, to my way of thinking, if you want to be a Buddhist, be a buddhist, but Christianity should never enter into the equation, because christianity is a different religion with different ideals, rules and laws.

Buddhism podcasts in English featuring non-white hosts?,"Hello!

On Leaving Online Buddhist Communities ‚Äî A Word of Advice,"I posted something along these lines sometime last year, but in time I came back. However, I've decided definitively that not only /r/buddhism but all online sanghas are a waste of time. I'm writing this to provide a last word of advice. For the record, I will not receive notifications about this to my inbox.

It's in vogue lately to insist that the internet can be a force for good. I've acquiesced that this is not possible. We wanted to be born as humans, and unskillful speech is par for the course of a human existence. Of course, we should strive for skillful speech in our own affairs, and treat others with respect and basic dignity regardless of their background, but that's on us to do the work of the religion.

That said, none of us here are arhats: Dan Ingram and Kenneth Folk's hyperbolic ramblings to the contrary. We are all ignorant to varying degrees. Some of us are real bastards who conflate being Asian with being a good Buddhist, and openly advocate killing Muslims in the name of defending family or culture without any sense of shame. Regarding killing, *you* cannot know for certain whether someone with a knife or a gun means to kill you or not. But if *you* kill that person, *you* know you have killed *them*, and *you* have hurt *yourself*.

The simple fact is that I have strong conviction in what the Buddha taught. I believe many of us come to these online communities because we have something to prove to ourselves: that this identity we've fashioned for ourselves is valid. But what do you do when you no longer feel the need to prove your convictions are valid? You set it aside, and you do the work that you need to do.

I encourage you all to make a similar investigation. I will not be visiting this subreddit any further. If you have any questions about the practice, you can address them as a PM to me, /u/Pathos315.",Buddhism,1462928484.0,t3_4ish5a,0.48,0
"I think Buddhism and Christianity are very similar religions/philosophies with the same message, just in another cultural and social environment","Now, ignore everything about the institutionalized version of Christianity, including the Catholic church, popes, bishops, crusades, wars and ignorant laws, since they are rather products of society and human ignorance, greed and other political & economic goals.

I think that Jesus is basically the Western (Middle-Eastern) Buddha. I think his story should not be taken literally, but rather as symbolic messages. 

Virgin Mary might represent innocence and moral purity. He was not literally the son of 'God', and 'God' itself should not be imagined as a talking lunatic residing in the clouds, but rather as the Universe itself.

My interpretation is that Jesus was very similar to Buddha. Buddha was from a noble family living in a palace, Christ was from a regular family living in a town - Buddha was intended to become a king, Jesus was intended to become a carpenter by their families.

The kicker comes next, they both somehow realize they aren't really happy in this repeating cycle (Samsara) and are suffering (dukkha), so both of them withdraw from society, Buddha starts meditating and Jesus starts praying.

They both realize the true nature of suffering - in Buddhism, Dukkha, in Christianity, Sin - Buddha finds Enlightenment, Jesus becomes the Son of God - symbolically One with the Universe.

They both began teaching about the right path, love, tolerance and the release of material wealth and desire, and gain followers and found their own churches. Jesus later gets executed by the Roman Empire, which might be interpreted as him becoming a Boddhisatva.

I think Heaven is basically the same as Nirvana, Finding God is the same as Enlightenment and Praying is the Western equivalent of Meditation, and the main goal of both religion is finding inner peace within the Samsara and achieving Nirvana.

Of course, this is only my personal interpretation, which might not be entirely correct.",Buddhism,1438240973.0,t3_3f4uv4,0.48,0

The Hate Against Soka Gakkai Nichiren Buddhism is Unjustified,"I am a lifelong practitioner of Nichiren Buddhism as an SGI member, and although my interest in the practice has ebbed and flowed over time, on the whole, I feel very grateful to this practice for helping me understand Buddhism and make sense of suffering and the challenges of life in this world. I feel that the message and practice of Nichiren Buddhism is very profound and meaningful. I like the community and gain great strength from the daily practice of chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo and gongyo (recitation of sections of the Lotus Sutra). I try my best, as a lay practitioner, to maintain a daily practice, and ponder about the utility and value of Buddhism in my daily life.

However, I feel that many people on the internet hate the SGI and Nichiren Buddhism a bit too much. SGI isn't perfect, but neither is it as bad as many people online suggest. A lot of the aspersions against the SGI are derived from bad tabloid journalism or anonymous posts on the internet. There is a great deal of conspiracy theorizing, rumor and gossip when discussing the SGI on sites like SGI Whistleblowers. Sometimes, it is fear of the unknown. That is not to say that all negative experiences that people have had with the group are illegitimate - indeed, individual encounters with members and leaders and the practice may have had issues for a variety of reasons. SGI has made mistakes, especially in earlier decades, and it remains a work in progress.

I, for one, remain grateful for it. It has connected me with the message of Buddhism, and introduced me to some great people, who have helped me at various points in my life. As a gay man who struggled with his identity as a teenager, I drew strength both from SGI's inclusivity as well as from the teaching of universal enlightenment that all human beings, regardless of any distinction, have the Buddha nature inherent within themselves, which they can polish through a regular and consistent practice, among other things. SGI Nichiren Buddhism is derided as materialistic, but this is untrue. Firstly, using the Buddhist practice for conspicuous benefits, although looked down upon by some Western Buddhists, is common in various parts of Asia. As such, living in the world in which material existence can be so challenging, deriving conspicuous benefits, can connect greatly with ordinary people (the poor, the sick, etc.) who may not have the mind space to think about greater things. Beyond that, however, the aim in Nichiren Buddhism and the SGI is to transform our desires, and to ultimately accumulate ""treasures of the heart"" and inconspicuous benefits, which will be valuable through the cycle of birth, death and rebirth. I encourage fellow Buddhists and indeed everyone to engage with this aspect of Buddhist philosophy. SGI members are often some of the less materialistic people among the people I know.

In Nichiren Buddhism, this world, and the transformation of life and suffering in the world we live in is crucial. We need to make it a Buddhaland (not defined as the universal acceptance of Buddhism, but rather the values that it is based on), and work towards alleviating suffering. This is the message of Mahayana Buddhism - not only working towards our own enlightenment/Buddhahood, but also of our fellow living beings. I feel that SGI and Nichiren Buddhism deserve more respect than it receives, and certainly less hate and backlash than it gets, based on incomplete and often false narratives and ideas.

I really don't understand... why ?,"# 1 ) To all people who say that they believe in karma, but not rebirth.

How does this logic even properly function at all ? If there is no rebirth, then what would you explain about whatever phenomena comes after a being on Earth dies ? Or before a being was born ? And by your logic, you also mean all beings that have just been born, have zero prior karma at all right ? Okay so let's assume that's true. Every being is born equal. Then how do you explain the unequality in form, environment and other elements about each of these beings ? Why are some born as animals like worms and pigs, while some are born rich - poor - or with physical - mental problems ? And evil people who do evil deeds, after they die, they get away from karmic debts for free right ?

I'm legit so confused by this logic. Karma and rebirth, to me, can't NOT exist together, without one another. If you have any plausible explanation as to why some people can even think like this logic at all, please comment down below to enlighten my ignorance.

I legit have seen this statement by many people so many times and my mental capability fail to comprehend the logic process behind it everytime.

# 2 ) To all people who say that ""Why aren't evil people punished by karma for their evil deeds ? Karma is fake/ unfair ?""

Umm this life isn't the only life we've experienced. Because unenlightened sentient beings experience rebirth so there are past lives and future lives, and who knows such evil people we see right now, did good deeds in past lives so they reap the sweet fruits they sowed in the past ? Of course their current evil deeds will lead them to pay the debt of bad karma in the future or future lives. Karma is NOT INSTANT justice system lol. There are conditions in between the cause and effect, which takes time. If it was instant and so obvious, people from millenials ago would've easily learned about its existence to do good, avoid bad. 

Also, karma doesn't work straight and directly 1 to 1 like, say, if a thief kills you to steal your cash, that doesn't necessarily mean you did something like that in a past life so now you're paying for it. That's a false assumption. We unenlightened beings have no knowledge about our past lives so these bold assumptions are dangerous and can lead people to wrong views.

What I'm trying to explain about the example above is like this. It could very likely be that: You don't have any bad karma like that in a past life to deserve to be killed and stolen as such. But, at that moment, at that place, that thief DECIDES to commit the crime by himself, and thus he created the evil deeds. Maybe you were just unfortunate somehow to be the victim who just happens to be at that moment, at that place, and the thief sees you as a target to commit the crime. Thus, the thief will reap the fruit of the evil karma he did in the future or future rebirth.

Samsara is dukkha,"Birth is dukkha. Aging is dukkha. Sickness is dukkha. Death is dukkha. As long as we are in the samsara cycle, there is dukkha.

As sad as the situation in Ukraine is right now, and as difficult as the issue of violence and defence is all the while, perhaps it is timely we self-reflect just what buddhism is about, and just what we have actually been saying and doing in the name of buddhism. Just so we are clear the buddhism we are practising.

I'm not a buddhist and I don't know the doctrines well. But I understand that buddhism is not ultimately about building karma. Because karma perpetuates samsara. It doesn't matter how supposedly 'good' a karma you tried to accumulate, as long as you are within the cycle of samsara, you will eventually be thrown into difficult situations like that of being a Ukrainian being attacked by invaders, or that of being an immediate witness to your sister being gang-raped and violated by a group of guys and she pleading for you to help. What are you going to do?

There is no true safety in samsara. This is dukkha. This is samsara.

So it's perhaps important to keep in mind that buddhism isn't simply focused about escaping bad karma (which is what many of the conversations recently focus on), and especially so in intentionally calculating karma with regards to self.

As long as we are training our mind to intentionally try to calculate karma (I don't know how that works out), and specifically calculate in terms of self interest, whatever conducive conditions of practice you find yourself in, present or in the future, will not help much, because you are just entrenching yourself deeper and deeper in samsara and dukkha.

Just like many of us now sitting and resting in the safety of our homes without bullets and bombs and aggressive invaders attacking us. How much of this conduciveness are you actually making use of to practice?

For those who finally have some appreciation of samsara and dukkha, and with the necessary disenchantment and thus sincerity in practice, there is the path of renunciation. And that is why we have monastic institutions to offer some protection for these renunciants. So that they don't have to get too involved with unconducive situations, and that they may fervently and wholeheartedly dedicate to practice.

The precepts, just like the monastic institutions, are also meant to protect. To help prevent the practitioners from getting involved in unconducive conditions. But these are not true refuge. These are not true safety from samsara.

The true refuge is that of nirvanic mind. It is realised through knowing the truth of samsara, of dukkha, of self. Technically you don't escape samsara and dukkha. The goal is actually relasation - awakening/enlightenment. Seeing through them for what they are - samsara, dukkha, self etc.

So karma and supposedly conducive conditions are just that. If we remain ignorant and deluded, we are just going to waste them and perpetuate samsara. If we are wakeful and mindful, every moment can be a moment of enlightenment.

Such that even when a man is spraying his machine gun on a crowd of people, you will not be stuck trying to calculate karma intentionally in terms of self interest, you will not be stuck in a simplistic binary mode of decision-making of that of killing that man or allowing that man to kill you.

There's a wide range of possibilities available in that situation, and it's open when we don't fixate in simplistic binary thinking and when we don't fixate simply to calculating karma of self-interest. It's open when all the while we have been making use of the conducive conditions we are given to practise, to understand the truth of samsara and dukkha and self etc.

There is no safety in samsara. Whatever we do as deluded beings will have consequences. So even while it's important not to justify and advocate violence/killing, it's important also not to make easy comments on intentional calculation of karma with regards to self interest from the comfort of our chair during a sensitive time like this. Don't advocate things you probably aren't capable of doing when placed in difficult situations.

This is a good time for self-reflection and to ask ourselves just what we have been saying and doing. If we aren't wise and capable enough to handle difficult topics yet, offer goodwill and compassion and encouragement to people who are suffering right now.

Some thoughts I have lately while watching the world situation unfold on the back on COVID and from reading the comments in this sub. Hopefully they can offer some useful perspective in viewing what buddhism is about.

Dangers of astral travelling/OBE,"Hi everyone

I have been meditating for a while now(usually before sleeping) and this causes me to wake up after some hours of sleep and enter that physical state that precedes the out of body experience.

I managed to astral travel only once by pure chance and for me it was nothing but a beautiful experience because I thought about the cemetery where my grandma was buried but it the astral body made it seem a totally different and blissful place.

After searching for some more informations I encountered some videos and websites that advice against astral travel and say that if you don't believe in Jesus you will get possessed by demons or other entities.

I would really like to explore more dream yoga because I think is the right path for me but first I would like to ask you how to correctly behave from a buddhist point of view during these out of body experiences and if it is really dangerous to do them.",Buddhism,1552079018.0,t3_ayvasr,0.5,0
This will be a VERY unpopular opinion but new people should read it. People complain too much on here. We're not magic.,"But I'm done pretending. As said by the Buddha basically, if it has good true intention he said it, even if someone didn't like it.

Somebody asked about addiction help on here earlier. They didn't like responses. Someone asked about this, that and the other thing. A couple didn't like responses.

You cannot just hop on a Buddhist subreddit and crap on people because you ask a question and don't like the replies.

Sure Buddhism is about the end of suffering but I honestly feel people misinterpret what suffering is. We're not talking about crying because your cat got run over. It's not about hating living with your parents because your dad is sometimes mean. It's a whole other level of suffering.

At the same time some very valid Buddhist things are brought up and people get upset about them. One thing I've done a lot of googling about if jhana. I found a lot of reddit posts with negative replies. Sorry folks but it's a big part of it, deal with it.

I feel like Buddhism is becoming a tool for those that don't wish to address their lives directly and are instead looking for some quick fix.

This doesn't exist in any religion. Even Christianity and alike where things are quickly ""forgiven"" and God shows you the way. I'm not knocking that religion but we all know honestly a lot of people sell it like that.

If you're addicted to drugs, quit.

If your dad sucks, leave. Don't say there's not a way, there always is. Worst case scenario, call the cops.

Girlfriend being mean? Dump her.

Want to kill something and justify it (like the other person that didn't like the response earlier) I'm sorry but that's just not Buddhist. Don't look to us for justification.

Not sure of what to do with your life? Neither are we lol. To an extent yes but in the bigger picture, we're all figuring it out.

Water flooded your basement? Get an insurance agent.

I think we get the point.

I'm not sure why so many people come here with trivial problems and get upset when they don't get an answer they like. I'll admit I'm in the ""don't like"" (complainers that don't address their issues) category but it's honestly not just about me. I see countless (at this point) good replies from other folks downvoted. Do you guys remember what downvotes are for? No? They are for topics that do not apply to the situation, not things that don't stroke your ego.

So the next time someone complains about their wife leaving them and stealing their trailer and dog like a sad country song, think about it. Don't encourage it! You're upvoting crap that has nothing to do with Buddhism and making it so more people fill this subreddit with junk.

I know Buddhism stresses compassion but it's hard to truly practice compassion for those that intentionally pervade and strive in ignorance. Like non-self, compassion is not a simple phrase that means the first thing you jump to. It's part of the bigger picture too. When it comes to trivial life issues, YOU need to address them. WE ALL DO. Buddhism cannot save you IF YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO SAVE YOURSELF!!!!

Buddhism is seen as a philosophy to some. Others a religions. Others a way of life. I like to combine all three but tell me, what other philosophy, religion or way of life instantly solves your problems?

Buddhism is a good REMINDER to address your issues but, it cannot save you if you do not try.

I wish people would see that.

Yes I suppose I'm being selfish. It's because I've limited time and come on here to read Buddhist things, not psychiatric issues.

I'm turning off inbox replies. I've said what I had to say. I hope some of you think about it.

Do you disapprove of stepping on bugs - why or why not?,"I'm 25 years old and have purposely stepped on bugs my whole life. Occasionally - rarely, a friend, acquaintance, or stranger will comment that what I'm doing is wrong or a sign of bad character or someone (usually a girl) will say I need to grow up. I've even heard people say that you can extrapolate how someone would act toward others based on their purposely squashing bugs for no reason. Once at a picnic I got up to throw something in the garbage, noticed a horde of ants bustling around a little ant mound, was sort of bored, so I lifted my foot over them and stamped it down. I sat back down and my buddy and I sort of snickered because I noticed my running shoes were full of mud and a ton of ants were now pressed deep into the maze-like treads and squirming about in their new rubber prison. Then out of nowhere some guy with another group who had seen me stepping on the ants called me a bully and ""inhumane"" because I step on ants. I replied to him by telling him to kiss my stinking feet, and which I guess is not that nice.

But at the same time, I believe I'm actually a pretty good natured guy to others. I volunteered as an EMT in college, treat others respectfully, believe in fair play when I run or swim competitively, I'm against scams, violence, etc. Most people I know consider me to be a pretty damn good guy.

I recognize some people believe in reincarnation, but I'm not one of them. So I don't see how stepping on bugs can be a sign of character. And if I really were stepping on someone's granny jane or their uncle bob, I guess my thoughts would be eh, better luck next time.

I'm an Eclectic Pagan and I incorporate Buddhist teachings and practices as well as Bodhisattvas. I wanted to share how I view these to get some feedback and comparison/contrast from all of you.,"So, to start off, I am an Eclectic Pagan, as I stated in the title. What that means for me is that I encorporate multiple spiritual beliefs, practices, and perspectives in order to make a more authentically personal system of my own.

I am also till debating whether or not, for me, if the devas/deities, bodhisattvas, elementals, etc have a physical form or if they are only a collective energy.

I wanted to see how all of you view Bodhisattvas as well as devas, in your own practices, for feedback and perspective purposes.

I have heard some say that bodhisattvas were actual beings whom strive to one day become buddhas; I've heard they are without form, etc. And am kind of confused on how buddhists view them, compared to my own perspective.

So I use mantras as a base for a majourity of my spiritual practice. When I, for example say Om Mani Padme Hum or Om Namo Bhagavate Sarva Durgate..., I feel the intent of that mantra and send it out into the Universe so that the intention can be fulfilled.

Which is a bit different than when I say the Medicine Buddha mantra ""Tayata Om Bekandze..."" wherein I usually have my animals or myself in mind,I am asking for the wellbeing and good health of myself or them to be restored. When I do this I feel like I am using the Bodhisattva as a conduit between myself and the Universal Energy (whatever energy can take away the suffering and restore health) which for me is usually the deity Gaia ( personification of the Earth Herself) Again ,I am growing with my practice and new theories and understandings of Deity change. 

But I guess my question is, do you see Green Tara, Medicine Buddha, Quan Yin, Shakyamuni, as real beings who ascended, primal energy like that of the cosmos (a star, nebula, atoms, neutrons,) a personification for our Higher Self (enlightened self), or something else?",Buddhism,1503902722.0,t3_6whqgx,0.52,1

Killed a crapload of flies this summer after 7 years of no killing,"Just curious what you think of this.

I am a dzogchen practitioner first and Namkhai Norbu did not have us take refuge formally with the Five Precepts, **but I do believe he thinks they are all important to maintain.**

He says mostly **""do your best""** and I think he keeps it this informal on purpose so that you won't break your vows.

He also says you can do whatever teaching you like if you think it will help you, so when I had the opportunity to take refuge formally and be connected to a vajrayana lineage, I did so.

I am sure over the years I have broken all 5 precepts, but not killing was one that I felt fairly easy to keep. I'm not sure exactly why breaking the others didn't bother me much. Like most people, I always find a way to rationalize an e-book heist (hey, I would have just bought it used, anyway, or borrowed it from the library; the publishers and the authors wouldn't have received a dime from that) and in the moment I am lying, I know there is a ""good reason for it."" Drinking? Dzogchen practitioners have no law against that.

Looking back on it, I find it extraordinarily unfortunate that I ever took the precepts formally because I simply opened up the opportunity to break them. I don't think I generated much merit from the act since I've done it. Although I've become a non-drinker and that vow is no longer hard to keep.

Anyway, last summer our house became insanely infested with flies. 12 in the morning, 30-something by the time we got home, even more the next day. There was no choice but to kill them. My wife was frustrated as hell (and terrible at killing them), so I finally decided to take some of this bad karma upon myself and kill them all. I said ""om mani padme hum"" as I did so and kept thinking to myself and making the wish almost like a magical pronouncement that these beings would be connected to the dzogchen lineage by the power of my intention and self-sacrifice in taking on negative karma for the good of all beings involved.

It took some thinking before I made this decision. **I won't explain my rationalization thoroughly because I see no reason to encourage other people go kill bugs.**

Just wondering your opinion. I killed probably 40 flies in all. Then, in the fall, I killed 3 or 4 mosquitos for the same basic reasons.

A reminder that we have a duty to other religions,"Recently, I've been seeing the occasional anti-Christian message. Instead of downvoting and being passive, let's try to correct wrong views with new wisdom.

Ashoka, the king who converted to Buddhism, has famously treated his subjects in his kingdom with respect to their religions. Not ""respect"" in the sense that many today see respect (i.e. ""I respect your religion as so far as you don't talk to me about it"") but actual, legitimate respect.

There was an edict enshrined by Ashoka, that still exists today, that had declared:

‚ÄúOne should not honour only one's own religion and condemn the religions of others, but one should honour others' religions for this or that reason.  So doing, one helps one's own religion to grow and renders service to the religions of others too.  In acting otherwise one digs the grave of one's own religion and also does harm to other religions.  Whosoever honours his own religion and condemns other religions, does so indeed through devotion to his own religion, thinking ""I will glorify my own religion"".  But on the contrary, in so doing he injures his own religion more gravely.  So concord is good: Let all listen, and be willing to listen to the doctrines professed by others.‚Äù",Buddhism,1392487538.0,t3_1xzufc,0.5,0

does anyone else think Christianity is a misinterpretation of Buddhism?,"edit: sigh, i hate my posts getting downvoted... especially when i feel like i've had some good conversation and learn quite a bit from it.  oh well, all i'm trying to do is learn and how else do you learn but to ask questions... if not silly or dumb questions?  thank you to everyone who replied

I saw an interesting [documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY0Ib3aPG6Y) about how Jesus might have actually been a Buddhist monk and it kind of opened my eyes.  I mean Jesus said he was son of god, that he was god, etc... and this makes sense from a Buddhist perspective right?  We are all god.  I now kind of think Christianity is just a misinterpretation of Buddhism.  I mean Buddhism is a bit abstract, the idea that we are and everything is god.  I can see someone get confused and personify god or maybe maliciously personifying god so that they can rule over people?  

I see similarities in praying vs meditation.  Its a bit simpler to think you are praying to a monothestic god, that praying the over encompassing universe.  

I dunno, just lately when someone says ""god bless you"" or something, i just kind of take it in a ""may the world/universe bless you"".  I have no desire to say ""i don't beleive in god"" anymore... because i do... i beleive in the universe and i personally feel that anything a Christian can share about god or their religion can be translated to a spiritual Buddhist-like perspective without offending the Christian.

Anybody else have any thoughts on this?  examples of similarities?  critiques?  i think this could be a fun conversation.

How can I verify if somebody is truly Enlightened?,"Lots of people have claimed Enlightenment, and many monks believe that they are Enlightened even though they are forbidden by precepts from claiming enlightenment. Even though the monks don't obviously claim their belief of Enlightenment, they still teach others what they think. The problem is that when we try to verify such person's teaching, they are able to deny responsibility for the result of what they taught because they didn't clearly claim any authority, even though, realistically, their claim of authority is implicit in their activities to teach others.

I believe that people should be able to know who they can learn the right way from. So I am wondering how I can determine whether someone really knows what they teach.

So my question is, how can I confirm whether someone is really Enlightened or not?

Are Mahayana Buddhists Worshipping Devas?,"Are Mahayana Buddhists worshipping devas? It seems like as Mahayana Buddhism spread throughout India and the rest of the world, it acculturated a lot of local deity/deva worship. These local deities or devas were then classified as Buddhas for the sake of providing a yidam/i·π£·π≠a-devatƒÅ and possibly for the sake of incorporating the local populace's pre-existing norms. I can see this quite prominently in the Tibetan tradition, where a figure like Tsong Kha Pa literally takes Saraswati as a yidam, or where Tara is revered as a Buddha, but may otherwise be perceived as a goddess in Hinduism. 

If I were to be charitable, I might say that the Mahayana is simply using these as immanent objects of concentration/reverence so that the individual practitioner may have a revelation of the transcendent. But if that is the case, then the practitioner could select a stone, or something that has no mindstream of its own (which a *deva does have*), or any old sentient being (because after all, even a deva is not a suitable refuge) . 

What do you think? Are there generations of Mahayana practioners worshipping devas under the assumption that they are Buddhas?

Buddhism and the Covid-19 Vaccination,"OK, I know we all heard enough about Covid-19 and the vaccines in the news and over the last 16 months already, but I need to ask this question!

First of all some things about me:

I'm 25 and currently living in Vienna, Austria, I started researching Buddhism about a year  ago. Turned Vegetarian about the same time! Buddhism was a light in the dark for me in the recent month and helped me to understand a lot of things going on in the world! But I still don't understand all of the traditions fully and that's why im asking this question:

Till this morning I  was 100% going to take the Covid-19 Vaccine as soon as I could. My believe is, that we are all connected on a higher spiritual level, which means, if I protect myself from Covid-19, I protect everyone I'm connected with! That's a kind of  basic belief I took from Buddhism and how to live my life. Correct me if I'm wrong here please!

Today Austria announced the ""Green Vaccination Passport"" and that every person having it will get back his rights, like visiting cinemas or night clubs. As it seems right now, Europe will introduce it soon afterwards as an international document.

I'm a defender of freedom and think we all should get back our normal lives as soon as possible! And of course, every single person at risk of dying from Covid-19 should be protected!But our Government does it by giving vaccinated people more rights than others. I basically feel like I'm forced to take the Vaccine now or otherwise won't be able to get back my rights.

I'd like to ask for your advice here. What's more important?Should I get vaccinated anyway to ensure my own and others safety and overlook the forced Passport?Or should I not get it because I feel like my rights get heavily violated with the forced Vaccination? It just feels like I would be doing it for the wrong reasons?

I know buddhism is not a forced religion and many things can be practiced different, but I¬¥d like to hear your opinion on this matter and maybe you know a similar situation in Buddhist Practicing where I could get a lead in the right direction!

Rebirth is a metaphor,"Hi all. I've posted here before, and I love lots of Buddhist teachings, but don't accept the supernatural claims such as gods or reincarnation.

I'm also convinced that ""rebirth"" simply means ""to experience certain states of consciousness over and over again."" So for example, if the Buddha says, ""The way to avoid rebirth is to avoid the mental states that are associated with a new birth,"" such as anger, jealousy, hatred, etc. I don't see a reason to assume this ""rebirth"" is an entirely new body in a new life. Rather, it's talking about states of consciousness, right now. How many times have we gotten angry? Then we look back and say, ""Oh, that was stupid. I don't want to do that again."" And yet, later on, we forget, and we get angry again. That's a ""rebirth"" of anger. The SAME STATE of consciousness that you live once, you are forced to live again. Unless, of course, you start to see it so clearly through meditation that you give it up, and it's extinguished (nirvana). I also believe nirvana is a metaphor for when these strong, negative mental states are so diminished that they, for all practical purposes, disappear. Anyway, please tell me what you think!

AMA Request: Buddhist who have achieved a supernatural power,"I know this will be a controversial subject, but Buddha has often spoken about supernatural abilities (abilities outside of the 5 senses) that is developed naturally as a side-effect of self-cultivation and meditation. Some examples of these abilities are:

* Remembering your past lives
* Gain knowledge of past and future events
* Read other people's minds
* Become invisible.
* Gain charateristics of certain animals.
* Gain full knowledge of cosmology.
* Communicate with higher beings in subtle worlds.
* Enter someone elses body after it's soul has departed.
* Travel without your physical body.
* Gain any infornation out of the Universe that you may have use for. 
* Ability to talk to the dead
* Walk through solid objects
* Walk on water
* Teletransportation

I'd like to think that Buddha wasn't lying when he mentioned these and that the only disconnect between the texts and the current reality is that most of us just aren't achieving this yet, or have but have chosen to stay quiet about it. To that end, I hope some of those who have experienced these abilities would feel free to talk about their experiences here. I'm sure some members here would be curious about it too.",Buddhism,1327904205.0,t3_p2p46,0.57,7
"I have the ""knowing"" of my previous lives... I don't know where to go from this point. Should I keep this for myself? Will people think I am mad if I talk like that? I don't live in a Buddhist country...","I had a revelation two weeks ago during a meditation\*. It came to me, I saw my previous lives up until seeing the first light... splashing on the bottom of the sea. I was there during the times I write about, I saw the events unfold. I travelled to times when humanity lived in the bushes, I had fur on my lower body and hands. Felt the fear of not having fire. And so on throughout all time. I felt that paganism or the old religions connects us to the nature, the animals within us that we were/are, the divinity of nature in all forms and the processes around it and within, we need to be connected to nature to be ourselves. There is no goodness or badness in nature, there are only processes to harmonize. Then there is the enlightenment, the understanding that we are part of both the physical realm and infinite metaphysical realms, the Buddha understood and because the Hindus already understood that we are all gods and part of divinity, he could proliferate his message. The story of us being gods went different in the Western world, as we all know. We westerners are just too stuck in duality, even today.

I constantly met the same kind of people within my visions, like they were bound to me. Especially my partner. The effect of it was so strong that I do see people differently now, I have seen most of them before. We have entangled lives with some people throughout eternity (or what I concieve as eternity). This is just a fact now, everything has become very simple to me and actually I have gotten much more confident in myself, my anxiety has gone and ADHD is so much better. The difference is stark. I love it and my partner as well. We love this idea of eternity together.

&#x200B;

I  know psychadelics or toxins are not accepted by the buddha, however I really feel like I have deepened many of my meditations and my understanding of the universe within me and the totality. I grew up non-religious in a christianized country, I never connected to christianity and thought that was the only spirituality there was, so I became a scientist. Five years ago, I started mindfullness and I discovered things in me that I really love to explore. I am now consciously moving to Buddhistic readings, with some other religions and spirituality in the mix as well.

&#x200B;

After I started meditating, I realized that we are all part of a higher consciousness or ""the knowing"", I searched and found the writings of the Buddha about non-duality, being one and nothing. I have  been the darkness, or the thing in between the light/consciousness.

&#x200B;

The problem is...I have been seeing a therapist for ongoing relationship issues with my family and I suddenly feel a strong aversion to telling her my truth of my past lives. I did the mistake of telling her a bit, but immediately regretted it after I uttered the word. Nothing she did or said made me change my view, but I felt I had already done this mistake in the past, and paid the consequences in horrible way. I have been extrememly open with her about everything and she has been very helpful but I cannot let go of the fact that I feel I have put myself in danger.

What could happen if there is a file somewhere with this? Should I downplay this a quirk and never talk about this again? Am I too paranoid? What would you do/have you done after realizing your past lives?

To give context: I have had ""visions"" of different things since I was a teenager, apparently it is normal. In my culture the lines between nature, spirit, ancestors and yourself is not so clear. For example, my grandmother was somewhat of an oracle, who people would ask for opinions and guidance. She would never take money or anything like that, it was just something normal, like the healer of the village would guide with some pain soothing medicine or the teacher telling what books to buy. So I accept that this is my reality, or my understanding of it as a human now. It will be strange for me to keep this a secret.

I'm so tired of telling people I'm not a Buddhist,"This is a bit of a rant but I hope you can see it as an essay. 

Ever since my teens I've been interested in how our brain works. I wanted to become a Psychologist, and for the first time I really applied myself in School with good results. Then I started studying Psychology in HS. I was so excited to get the book for PS I read through it the first day looking for what I could do. I didn't find anything. There was Roscharsch (this was the 90's) and if you were an ""Anal"" or ""Oral"" personality type. Neither of these are in PS books today btw. Then I talked to our teacher, asking him what we could do. He said Psychology didn't work that way. So I asked him how it worked. He told me you could either work in research or therapy. ""Great"" I said, ""What do you do in therapy?"". Apparently you just listen to people talk about their problems. This can temporarily feel better but imho it's certainly not a long term resolution. Analyzing yourself is not a solution either because it doesn't teach you what you can do to feel better, which it seems is what people looking for therapy really want at the heart of it. 


I dropped out of HS and started working in IT instead. I became somewhat successful but I never had any real passion for it. So in the early 2000's I stumbled upon something, something more pragmatical which made sense. I think the most valuable thing I garnered from here was the ability to test, both logically and pragmatically, the value and/or quality of something. This means if I stumble upon a technique I can with some speed and accuracy determine if it's hogwash or not. This is when I got in contact with Buddhism on a more intimate basis. And by that I mean more than just history and basics that you might learn in School, but instead I got access to the more pragmatical parts of it. And I'm in awe. 



I tend to compartementalize Buddhism into 3 areas:


The religous part - Ending the cycle of rebirth


Philosophy - Here might be included to not hurt other beings, being humble etc. These might lead to actions but they are not really pragmatical in and of themselves


Techniques - Here's the meat (for me). This includes things such as Meditation, Mindfulness, Firebreath and so on. 


Now I consider Psychology as the Buddhism of the west. But it's pretty horrible. There are very few techiques and the only Philosophically oriented tips I've heard are ""Don't just rely on one thing in your life, you need to do more things. Have several hobbies, several friends and several things you are interested. Don't rely on just one person such as your gf."" That's it. In fact it's so bad most studies aren't even repeatable: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/scientists-replicated-100-psychology-studies-and-fewer-half-got-same-results-180956426/


Now I don't know why we don't teach Buddhism in School. There at least 2 parts of Buddhism that are of much higher quality than anything that the west has produced, in fact, as far as I can tell the west has not produced anything new that's not already been mentioned in Buddhism. Flow? It's in Buddhism. Focus/Attention? It's in Buddhism. Etc. Now I know some of you, becaus I've written about this before here, don't consider Buddhism scientific. But I disagree with that, Buddhism is in fact highly scientific. Buddhism, as far as I can tell, is very experimental. They test things and if the results aren't good they drop it and do something else. This is why 5000 years of tradition have produced so many effective methods. 


And this is why it pisses me off so much why this stuff isn't taught in Schools. Can you imagine teaching meditation and mindfulness to all children every day from a young age? The amount of impact this would have on our society would be absolutlely massive and totally unpredictable. And the rest of these childrens school attendance would be dramatically improved. The ""information stuffing"" would go easier and they would probably become a lot better at being autodidactic. 


Now the reason I titled this the way I did is because when I talk to students I often mention Buddhism and as a result of that people think I'm a buddhist and think it's weird. First of all it should'nt be weird to be a Buddhist to start with since it's the most effective thing we have out there. Second of all they should already know these things I'm teaching them.

The reaction should be ""Oh, it's so nice and interesting the things you know about Buddhism"" not ""OMG are you a Buddhist, that's so weird!""",Buddhism,1643726518.0,t3_shwjvt,0.53,2

"Westerners pretending to be Buddhist, does it bother you?","To preface, I‚Äôve learned a long time ago to completely stop talking about Buddhism to many people close to me in my life and even in this forum at times. 

They argue over concepts and dictate what Buddhism is, when they have never read a sutra or stepped foot in a temple with the intention of learning from a teacher. 

On Reddit it is less concerning, just yesterday someone was telling me we have no gods in Buddhism and it is just a philosophy. That‚Äôs easier to ignore, however I feel like what happened to yoga is happening to Buddhism. Some people believe it is just breathing meditation. They proclaim to have vast knowledge of Buddhism and practice when it couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. 

A person close to me went on a visapanna retreat and believed they have been learning Buddhism all along. They don‚Äôt understand simple terms like non-self. They argue when I say it means impermanence. They said no ‚ÄúIt means, don‚Äôt take things personal‚Äù

I guess I‚Äôm happy they are interested but it makes a one way conversation of me listening because they get wildly upset when I explain what something actual is. So I typically change the subject and avoid these topics

I feel bad though for them and myself in a way I maybe shouldn‚Äôt, it seems like someone may be interested in something I am deeply involved. They don‚Äôt understand it at all and are trying to dictate something they have never practiced. I can feel the anger form people when you correct them. 

Is there another way to approach this other than ignoring them or changing the subject?

It seems to me that there is much less emphasis on Gautama and the actual teachings of Gautama.

(potentially upsetting) How Can Transgender Work with Buddhism?,"I am not transgender, but a close friend is. Here in the United States, Buddhist circles seem pretty passionately pro-transgenderism and non-binary.

I don't intend to sound inflammatory, but am asking from a philosophical/theological perspective: are these not incompatible?

If one of the central tenets of Buddhism is not clinging and cutting through the illusion of the ego, I don't see how transgenderism isn't rejected on a philosophical level, since it is inherently rooted in clinging/aversion to the aggregates. Transgenderism is clinging to an idea (gender, what gender am I) and of course ego (I am the concept, how do others see me, they need to see the concept I want them to see).  It is also aversion to the opposite idea (the gender you don't want to be). Is this not contrary to the Buddha's teachings?

Also, the very claim of transgender is metaphysically dualistic (despite your body, there is a Self that is a certain gender inside).  Is this not contrary to Buddhism?

Again, I am not asking this to be mean-spirited or pull a ""gotcha"",  I just genuinely can't justify the transgenderism from a Buddhist philosophical framework, and so either the entire US community has a blindspot, or more likely, I do and I just can't for the life of me see what I'm missing.  It is difficult because I can't really ""support"" my friend when fundamentally, I view them as confused and ego-clung from the Buddhist framework (we're best friends and nothing changes that, but if they ever try to elicit my support for transgenderism itself, I feel forced to lie and then further confuse them).

Thanks.  


  
EDIT:  Amazing responses so far, I'm grateful for that, as in many communities this topic is tantamount to hate speech and so nothing gets accomplished.  I've definitely gained more compassion for real gender dysphoria (I specify ""real"" only because I do know it can be transitory for some people rather than chronic/immutable) and those who have taken steps to alleviate it. I think fundamentally, my questions don't pertain to real gender dysphoria, because they cropped up around my friend who experiences none at all, which does still strike me as obsession with the aggregates since it's not rooted in the alleviation of psychological suffering but embodying a concept more fully.",Buddhism,1650491134.0,t3_u87drh,0.59,8
The family life is indeed no good for serious practitioners. Consider this a part two to a long lost post.,"In summary of the other post I had mentioned basically that it can be rough if you're a SERIOUS buddhist and have a family. Finding time to meditate, study, etc. I got lashed out at for it of course by the non-buddhists and such that don't understand the whole foundation of buddhism is about escaping rebirth which requires detachment to put it in simple simple english.

Anyhow, that post never said I didn't love them. It effectively said I did love them and that itself was a problem but I did not expect to be fully enlightened this life anyway so I'd go on a family man.

TO NOW:

Things have changed. Communication was never great I've realized. During the first half of our relationship I was a drunk. I guess I was a buddhist too but, I didn't know what buddhism was. I just believed the same. Then googling my beliefs I found Buddhism. Yes of course it had some thoughts I didn't but it was spooky similar like I had studied it prior. Part of why I believe in rebirth. I don't wish to debate it.

That is my fault see. I wasn't a mean drunk fully. Sometimes I was a dick but I quit drinking eventually and we grew really happy even while I was drinking. I mean, she was too and smoking weed and stuff which whatever but my drinking was killing me and interfering with aspects of life so I intended to quit.

Why am I focusing on the drinking? As the years go buy I'm realizing more and more that communication just .. hardly exists ""proper"". It exists but she constantly misunderstands everything, I must repeat things over and over, she argues, etc. See .. this would be great practice for understanding and patience and I've used it as such. The problem arises when I kindly explain what I've said prior and she'll argue until I show her the text or simply walk away if it was said in person. Sometimes I do snap which, I really do not like. Not physically but .. I am human. I yell. ""enough"" basically.

Even that see. There's constant stress from this communication thing.

On top of that ... sex. See for a while she like didn't want to have sex as much for some reason so I'm like whatever. I started the meditations on the body. The intestines and all that fun stuff ya know. Charnel grounds, etc. During the day I got to never wanting sex, even when naked chicks popped on TV. My wife works nights. The only time sex popped in my mind were the nights she had off and I woke up beside her.. right beside her... Anyway.

Suddenly she wanted to go back to normal again. I wasn't the most happy given she knows my practice and that I'd rather ""be all in"" or ""be all out"". In other words, I'd rather be abstinent or just have sex on the regular. I don't want to be TRYING to not have sex but have her springing it on me randomly.

That happened multiple times. There's more but I'm not here for counseling nor to simply complain. Truly.

Now, let me go onto children's behavior, time consumption, etc. I love them. They're great but, good luck with time.

**Let me say this bluntly: I love my family but if I could do it again knowing what was in my mind and heart was Buddhism, I would not have. I do not regret this and will not leave them but if you're seriously considering buddhism then seriously consider the sex you're having. EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT AIMING TO BE A MONK. You may find you wish to practice more seriously than you intended. You can always get laid/married later if you change your mind.**

EDIT for the non-practioners: Why are these problems? Because they're obviously constant distractions and stress. Like I said, ""serious"".

Setting Christianity Aside,"I think I can prove to myself whether or not Christianity, or Catholicism in particular, is false. And that‚Äôs by transforming myself through sheer willpower. That‚Äôs because the teaching of my current faith is that you can‚Äôt be freed from sin but by the grace of God. This is a dogmatic teaching, so if it‚Äôs shown to be false by proven experience, then it‚Äôs as though the whole edifice of Catholicism crumbles. Because a dogma is a truth fallen from heaven, the Church is supposed to be protected from binding the faithful to heresy.

Reality honestly seems to suggest to me however, so far, from my immersion into different religions and philosophies, that ascetic practices in general, in and of themselves, are capable of healing sin and freeing one from suffering. Practices such as devotion, meditation, introspection, thought control, contemplation and more. And, of course, worldviews also have an impact on how one lives and responds to things as well.

As the title suggests, I‚Äôm not quite giving up on Christianity. There‚Äôs intellectual problems I still have to face if I‚Äôm to abandon it entirely. I‚Äôm just going to put it off if you will to see whether or not Buddhist teachings and practice can result in a significant self-transformation. Indeed, I think I‚Äôll strive to keep particularly Christian morals as a point to prove to myself whether or not it‚Äôs false, such as no sexual activity outside of marriage.

I struggle with mental illness and addiction, and have sort of relied on this powerful religious experience I went through several years ago to maintain my faith. I was practicing hesychasm in a way, or rather, the Jesus Prayer, for a couple of weeks, all day at work. O Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner. But I wouldn‚Äôt pray at all if I had fallen to one of my addictions that day. I was smoking synthetic marijuana, and one night I was contemplating suicide by heroin, when I prayed the prayer for the first time a day I had fed my addictions. Well, it was a clear night, and I swear I heard thunder, felt my bosom become energized, and it was like I was compelled to pray the prayer until I was sober.

It was as though God proved his existence to me that night. I just sort of ignored the major delusional episode that happened shortly after. And just always assumed that this experience was legitimate. But after having had my third major delusional episode, the experience has lost its impact.

To learn the teachings of the Buddha, I am turning to the two most popular teachers in the West, Thich Nhat Hahn, and the Dalai Lama. I‚Äôm ordering their books on Amazon tonight, The Heart of the Buddha‚Äôs Teaching, and One Teacher, Many Traditions. I‚Äôm also ordering a zafu/zabuton meditation set, and some mala beads. Mantra meditation with beads seems very similar to the hesychasm I have been practicing.

"Beware anyone who refuses to talk openly or honestly about even the lowest levels of attainment. There are 10 fetters, someone who cannot even admit their own state as to the first 3 should raise giant red flags. The Buddha was open and honest about sharing the secrets of the Dhamma with others.",">  A sotƒÅpanna is a person who has seen the dharma and consequently, has dropped the first three fetters (sa≈ãyojana), namely:  
1. Self-view (sakkƒÅya-ditthi)   
2. Clinging to rites and rituals (sƒ´labbata-parƒÅmƒÅsa)  
3. Skeptical indecision (vicikitsa)  

>  The first moment of the attainment is termed the path of stream-entry (sotƒÅpatti-magga), which cuts through the first three fetters.  The person who experiences it is called a stream-winner (sotƒÅpanna).

>  The sotƒÅpanna is said to attain an intuitive grasp of the dharma, this wisdom being called right view (sammƒÅ di·π≠·π≠hi) and has unshakable confidence in the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha. 

There are many valid reasons to refrain from claiming the higher states of attainment such as being a once-returner, non-returner, or an arahant.

There is NO valid reason to brag or expect praise after achieving the lowest level of attainment, stream entry.  Anyone who is lying about attainment to themselves or others would clearly lie about grander things than the first 3 fetters.

Any ‚ÄúGuru‚Äù who refuses to talk about even the lowest level of attainment, refuses to give any clues or help to a student trying to achieve stream entry, is obsessed with aggressively attacking other stream winners ‚Äî such a person should be viewed with extreme caution and any advice they give should be taken with extreme skepticism.  Any Guru who only quotes the Dharma but never explains anything in their own words and always changes the subject away from stream entry.  All signs point to such a person as masquerading as a Fake Guru. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

Stream entry is overcoming:

1. Self-view 
2. Clinging to rituals and practices 
3. Skeptical doubt 

If you only look inward, only trying to see your true mind there is no ritual.  If you see your true mind, essentially the pure imagination of birth, which has created a complex and imaginary sense of self and all the fetters over a lifetime of sensory input, this is seeing through self view.  If you really believe this is ‚Äúit‚Äù and there‚Äôs no deeper secret you‚Äôve overcome skeptical doubt and are ready for stream entry.  It has to be an insight you feel in your bones, not simple words.  There is no rule on how long it will take for your mind to be ripe to attain steam entry, or how it will finally occur. 

Anyone who refuses to talk openly and honestly about even the very first step of their attainment should be seen as a potentially Fake Guru with questionable motives or incomplete knowledge of the Dhamma. 

The Buddha talked openly and frankly to anyone and everyone about all of the states of attainment, clues and practices to get there, and gave descriptions of his inner state almost to nauseating length in order to help others achieve the same result. 

You do not have to be a perfect saint (arahant) to become a stream winner.  Buddhism is the path to enter sainthood, sainthood is not the requirement to enter Buddhism. 

The Buddha helped an untold amount of ordinary people become stream winners and he was never obscuring anything.  If anyone is seeking to obscure or hide anything about even the lowest levels of attainment it should be viewed as a giant red flag. 

You should not spend your whole life in suffering, it is worth the effort to try to become a stream winner.  It is possible and anyone can achieve it with sincere effort and practice.

I feel as though there is a dearth of literature/discussion specifically around the intersection between Buddhism and feminism. Does anyone feel similarly?,"I am 23 years old and consider myself to be a passionate and dedicated feminist. For the past few years, I have undergone a sort of ""feminist awakening"" and have been reading, writing and talking about feminist issues with others. For approximately the same amount of time, I have been reading some Buddhist literature, and slowly absorbing and embracing the ideas. It has been a struggle to completely implement Buddhist teachings into my everyday life, but I know that is a universal struggle among practicing Buddhists. 

One big problem I have run into is how to seamlessly integrate feminism and Buddhism into each other. I almost never come across the topic of feminism in readings, podcasts, or posts in related subreddits such as /r/ZenHabits. This is distressing, because I firmly believe that feminism at its core is a ""wise and loving politics"" (to quote the great Bell Hooks, a wonderful feminist author. The entire quote is right [here](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/295265-visionary-feminism-is-a-wise-and-loving-politics-it-is) for anyone interested). 

One difficulty in particular that I regularly encounter is the ability to curtail my own reactivity when faced with street harassment or other forms of public sexual violence. As the great Eckhart Tolle (the writer I have read the most of) says, reactivity is just another way for our egos to feed themselves. Yet, when I experience or read or hear misogyny out in the world, it is very difficult to not be affected by it. And I'm not sure it is *right* to strive to remain unaffected by it, because I believe taking a silent and passive approach is not helpful for change, and calling people out on hateful speech is important.

I know that people who are particularly chauvinistic are generally deeply unconscious people and are also likely to be racist, classist, materialistic, etc. However, I am friends with certain men who I know read/study/attempt to internalize Buddhist literature, and cannot understand the sexism that women regularly face that make it difficult to remain as calm, nonreactive and stable as the Buddha. In many cases, it is simply very unsafe for one to not react to forms of sexual violence, and it is extremely offensive to tell female victims of rape/assault to ""just forgive"" their aggressors in the wake of deep trauma.

I just googled ""Buddhism and feminism"" and came across [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Buddhism-After-Patriarchy-Feminist-Reconstruction/dp/0791414043), which looks like a great read. Before reading it though, I would really like to read any thoughts on this issue from this subreddit. My guess is that not many readers here are female (simply because of the Redditor demographic) but it's a start. Any females who can offer their ideas for integrating Buddhism and feminism/feminist activism, I would be so thrilled to read what you have to say.

Fatal Flaw in Buddhism,"I adhere to most tenets of Buddhism, however, I think I have encountered a fatal flaw in any Indic (or otherwise) religions espousing rebirth. I hope that someone can counteract this with something reasonable. 

My thinking follows in this manner. A central tenet of Mahayana Buddhism is that rebirth in the human realm is of greatest import because it allows one to follow the path of Dharma. However, due to the Sun's life-cycle [four billion years from now, the increase in the Earth's surface temperature will cause a runaway greenhouse effect, heating the surface enough to melt it. By that point, all life on the Earth will be extinct.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_of_the_Earth) Due to this, it stands to reason that there will no longer be any human realm to be reborn into, at which point all chances for Buddhahood will be lost. 

I'm not trying to cause a rift in the sangha, just hoping someone will rebut this so I can stop entertaining such a troubling thought. ",Buddhism,1466530673.0,t3_4p5uwv,0.56,3

r/Buddhism it ok if I add a strictly small non-intrusive non-abusive footer with a way to accept donations in my posts?,"Hello reddit,
I'm Shi Shan Yu, born name Antonio. Since it's a sensitive subject I beg you to read it throughly before voting.

First let me make clear that earning **anything** at all is not of my interest when posting. I like to post here and comment and give advice in anything I can just because I like it. I do it because I want to do it and for the benefit of anyone reading it. I don't know if some of my posts are very good or bad or neutral, but I try to put my best effort in them whenever I write them. I'm very glad when people find it useful (and that's all the motivation I need) and I always try to think out how to make my topics more interesting, more useful or more understandable to all the people here. 

Right now our [school](http://xueyuan.com.mx) is going thru a tough situation economically. We are working very hard to solve this problem, we are not lying in our back at all, but if anyone is in a position of helping (and I understand that not many of us are), we would welcome any help and thank you very deeply.

Any donation no matter how small would help us greatly. Our institute is devoted to teaching Ch√°n Buddhism and Shaolin customs (incluiding kung fu) and we have done it for free for 2 years now, since all the money we get has gone to pay rent, water or improving the school so that people can train or practice in a better place.

I'd like to make clear that if you agree I will keep posting the same posts as usual and if you don't agree I will keep posting the same posts as usual. Again, I post here because I like to and because I want to, not because I want to ask you for money.

So I'd like to hear your opinion and thoughts. Please give it a chance. I'm not asking you for money, I'm asking you to let me add a non intrusive or abusive way so that people that want to help us can send us their donations.

Anyway thanks for your time reading this.

The footer would be like this (and would only be added in self posts like this):

It'd be a place without bigotry or sectarianism...WAIT! There is one!ü§ù","# üôè -- GOLDEN SWASTIKA -- üôè

\-----

‚ò∏Ô∏è **What is it**

It is a *Buddhist Community* on **Discord** that has proven itself to be a productive social networking, learning, and educational safe-space for Buddhists **(13+)** from all around the world. It is a multi-tradition server that has helped hundreds of Buddhists to meet new Buddhists (Lay and Clergy), make friends, and be able to discuss the Dharma not with strangers like in other forums but with people you got to know over time. It is where we can make online Buddhist friends, and talk with them about whatever we want from a Buddhist perspective; From politics to Buddhist cultures, from gaming to Buddhist cuisine. *(Full list of features below)*

It's a community built around the pillars of anti-colonialism, where we can freely discuss the marginalisation of Buddhism and Asian Buddhists. Although optional for many members, this has been one of our defining pillars. anti-colonial, criticising harmful movements\*

**No matter what kind of a Buddhist you are, Golden Swastika is for you.** If you are either a new Buddhist who wants to ask questions, a Buddhist who wants to make more lay friends, a Buddhist looking for a space that gives freedom to be critical of movements harmful against Buddhism, or even a non-Buddhist wanting to learn more about Buddhism by talking to people who have lived decades within its culture and teachings, **this is the place for you!**

So, here is what we have to offer!

# ‚öôÔ∏è Our Features

‚öôÔ∏èüåê **Socialise and Network:**

Meet Buddhists of all sorts of traditions from many different countries, ranging from lay to clergy, inexperienced to experienced and converts to born-Buddhists. It is important to socialise with and have trustworthy, kind, knowledgeable friends in your journey as a Buddhist. This server offers the chance to accomplish those two things!

**‚öôÔ∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà LGBTQ+ Friendly:**

Golden Swastika has always been a safe-space for LGBTQ people. Inspired by the dharma, we do not allow any sort of Homophobia or Transphobia on our server. Every kind of person is welcome in this community. We cannot ask you to always understand each other, or see eye to eye on social issues, but we can all be respectful and kind to each other. And that's what we have been very successful at so far!

‚öôÔ∏èüßí **Curated Experience for Teens:**

We both want to allow buddhists of all kinds in our server, but also be able to discuss more mature and darker subjects surrounding the Dharma or our lives as Buddhists. To do this, the Server features a curated experience for people who pick up the 13-18 age role where they will have limited access to certain channels, and have access to channels others don't.

‚öôÔ∏èüîß **Professional Management**:

We offer a top-notch professional and diverse crew in our management team, including people who have had experience in moderating servers with more than a thousand people, and people who have worked in the software development industry. The management works via a council that discusses and votes on server issues. Our team is made up of people from very diverse backgrounds: Theravada to Mahayana, Young and Old, born-buddhists and converts, queer people, Lay people to Ministers.

‚öôÔ∏è‚úã**Transparency:**

Unlike many other online spaces, Golden Swastika prides itself on its distribution of power and transparency when it comes to moderation and administration. It is run by a transparent democratic council, instead of a single individual. All suggestions are taken very seriously, and server-criticism is welcomed.

‚öôÔ∏èüé≠ **Expressive Channels**:

The Community features many expressive (yet optional) channels that are not necessarily purely dharma oriented: Leisure channels to socialise over lay-life, channels to play games via Bots, or more serious channels where we discuss Cults or Politics. However you would like to express yourself to your Buddhist friends, it is possible here!

**‚öôÔ∏èüìà Leveling:**

We feature a new-user-friendly leveling system that aims to ease new user's access to more advanced and optional channels to prevent channel-creep.

**‚öôÔ∏èüñåÔ∏èAesthetically pleasing server design.**

**‚öôÔ∏èüìø Regular Group Prayers hosted by experienced Buddhists**

**‚öôÔ∏è**üõ°Ô∏è **Top Notch anti-raid protection that has been proven to work.**

**‚öôÔ∏èüìö Channels made for the purpose of Learning and Education.**

# ‚õî What we don't have, and do not allow

‚õî **No Bigotry:** Racism, Xenophobia, Queerphobia, Sexism, Toxic behavior, Pro-Colonialism and other forms of Bigotry is absolutely unwelcome in this community.

**‚õîNo Misrepresented Buddhism:** This space is highly and vocally critical of the Cultural appropriation of Buddhism. Therefore no Secular ""Buddhism"", no new age practitioners looking to steal buddhist practices, no cult members, and so on.

‚õî**No Sectarianism:** Our server opposes any kind of sectarianism. Individual expression and justification for preferring / not preferring a teaching / school is totally understandable, but any sort of public disparagement of any valid school of Buddhism is completely against what we stand for. All schools of Buddhism ranging from esoteric theravada to nichiren, from tendai to nyingma are all protected.

We need strong friendships in our Buddhist path. What are you waiting for?

"Dharma Master Hengyun answers questions about abortion (2/3): ""What about sexual assault?""","**Question: If a girl were raped and got pregnant, is abortion allowed in such a case?**

 Answer: This kind of situation really deserves our sympathy. However, if the girl aborts the fetus, she would be killing a life. Therefore, even in these unfortunate circumstances, she still should give birth to the child. Although the girl may encounter a lot of hardship by doing so, from the perspective of causes and effects, having the baby is a better alternative than killing.

...

Let‚Äôs think about it, after children are born, their parents treat them as precious treasuries and take care of them with the upmost attention to detail. However, the fetus in one‚Äôs womb is also one‚Äôs own child; how can one bear to kill him or her? If your abort a child, even if the child originally has positive affinities with you, such affinities would become negative like that of an enemy. The aborted fetus turns into ‚Äúa little ghost who is difficult to handle.‚Äù

The Shurangama Sutra pointed out that, ‚ÄúOne should realize that debts should be settled, whether with money, goods, or labor, so that indebtedness can naturally come to an end. But if, in the process of repayment, beings take each other‚Äôs lives or eat each other‚Äôs flesh, then they may well continue through an infinite number of eons, eating each other and killing each other, as if they were turning ceaselessly on a wheel, now on top, now beneath. The wheel may never stop unless they undertake the practice of samatha, or unless a Buddha appears in the world.‚Äù

...

During the process of mutual resentment, if one living being kills another or eats another‚Äôs flesh, then a cycle of eating and being eaten, killing and being killed will go on and on like the turning of a wheel. For example, you eat my flesh now, I will kill you later; I eat your flesh now, you will kill me later. This vicious cycle is endless, unless one attains the Shurangama Samadhi or a Buddha comes into the world and releases one from these karmic offenses. Only then would both the debtor and the creditor understand the need to stop creating further negative karma, and end this cycle of ceaseless mutual-indebtedness. Otherwise, it is very difficult to appease animosity that is as great as the sea. It is not surprising that the Venerable Master said: ‚ÄúI urge everyone not to have abortions any more. Think about it, if living beings become resentful spirits even before they are born, with these vengeful little ghosts of aborted fetuses everywhere, how can the society be peaceful? These little ghosts can only be crossed over by genuine cultivators of the Bodhi Path who are not greedy for wealth. These little ghosts are really tough to handle! It is very difficult to resolve these matters, and thus, with karmic offenses pervading everywhere, how can there be peace?‚Äù

What is Zen?,"**According to the late Joseph Campbell**: 

>This word *zen* is the Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese word *ch'an*, and the Chinese word is a mispronunciation of the Sanskrit word *dhyana*, which means ""contemplation."" Contemplation normally is thought of as disciplined meditation. I have spoken about the *ku·πá·∏çalinƒ´* yoga, a form of psychological and spiritual discipline that consists of bringing a serpent of energy up through the spine. In Zen, you seek to transform your mode of experience through just this kind of spiritual exercise so that you actually come to the illumination that the Buddha came to in the way the Buddha himself did, not just seated in a shrine being a little dragon mouth saying ""Buddha, Buddha, Buddha,"" then expecting to get somewhere. Here you are going to go to *work*.

**The Zen or Chan School**

Originally, the Sanskrit term ""dhyƒÅna"" was rendered into Chinese using the following characters, Á¶™ÈÇ£ (chan na). This is an approximation of saying the Sanskrit word, dhyƒÅna. Later the ""na"" was dropped which then became Chan (Á¶™) and in Japanese Zen.   

The formal idea of a Zen or Chan School/chan zong came much later. It was first conceived of by Chanshi Zongmi (780‚Äì841) as an extended clan of ten lineages one of which was Tiantai. The idea of a Chan School was not adopted until the ninth century; nor did it gain much attention until the Song. At no time was there ever an institutionally separate Chan School apart from Buddhism. Another name for the Chan School is the *Buddha Mind School* (‰ΩõÂøÉÂÆó). 

Looking at the word, Chan School/Chan zong, we should be kept in mind that it is not a sect (= dissenting religious body). Zong is the Chinese rendering of Sanskrit, *siddhƒÅnta* which pertains to realization. Translating zong by either ""school"" or ""lineage"", proves to be an inadequate translation which doesn't reflect the full meaning of *siddhƒÅnta*. We might even think of the Chan School as meaning the Chan or Zen realization. 

The core principle of the Chan School is, *illumination of Mind; seeing one's true nature* (ÊòéÂøÉË¶ãÊÄß).  The core practice is ""gongfu"" (ÂäüÂ§´) defined as *inner practice and cultivation of mind*.  A word about seated meditation, it is practiced in virtually all schools of Buddhism. It is part of gongfu. It is certainly not unique to the Chan School.

I'll stay open minded but here's my current problem with Tibetan Buddhism and the Dalai Lama,"First of all, I think Dalai Lama is a great person, he seems very compassionate and obviously very knowledgeable in Buddhism. I'm not sure if he is a great monk however.  

 I can't help but feels like as a monk he shouldn't involve in human politics or be celebrated as an idol to the extent that he is allowing himself to. 

Furthermore, he wears a rolex and I heard he has a collection of rolex watches, does it not go against the code of living simple and austere life as Buddha himself taught?

Now my criticism towards Tibetan Buddhism. Diety worshipping, blessings, rituals and other form of superstitions are openly encouraged in their practice. This is obviously in conflict with the essence of four noble truth or the eightfold path, which suggest that only you can attain enlightenment for yourself and that the practice, discipline everything has to be pretty much self reliant and autonomous. You cannot bless another person into great wealth, good health or into Nirvana. So what are they doing?

A Meditation for Michael Dorfman,"Michael Dorfman and hyun_a left /r/Buddhism a treasure a little over a month ago:

hyun_a:
> why is pursuing nirvana, specifically, preferable to leading a good life?

Michael Dorfman:
> Because of the First Noble Truth.
> Even a rebirth in the Tushita heaven involves suffering amidst the joy, and nirvana is the cessation of all suffering (hence superior.)

hyun_a:
> I am not sure what is so attractive about Tushita to begin with. I am talking about a moral life that would lead to enjoyment of travel, art, social interactions, culture, intellectual development, physical challenges, exploring of nature, space and mysteries of existence. And these would be enjoyed life, after life, after life, if one strives in all lives to be moral, to the best of their ability. So, with favorable conditions and minimal suffering, why is nirvana preferable to all these?
> What does nirvana provide one, to begin with, that would override pleasurable experiences, whether of the body, heart or of the mind? Is it a continuous state of peace/tranquility/bliss, that lacks suffering? I am trying to establish some points of reference that would motivate one to choose pursuing nirvana over pursuing a moral life that minimizes suffering and maximizes good living conditions in the present and future.

---

I encourage everyone to meditate on this. It is a *very* good question. User vgtaluskie continued the original thread (which is below Michael Dorfman's last comment) but I think the question deserves another go-around.

EDIT: About 30 seconds after I posted this, I recalled that this is essentially the plot of the excellent movie Star Trek: Generations, which features a ""nexus"" that can provide such experiences. So for those who have seen the movie and who know what I'm talking about (or you can just read about it here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_Generations) the question can be rephrased as, **if I had access to the nexus, why would I want nirvana?**",Buddhism,1392970354.0,t3_1yirpf,0.5,0
Buddhism and atheism are completely compatible.,"Wahola Rapula, a Buddhist scholar and author of ""What the Buddha taught"" says, and I do not quote, that Buddhism is neither a religion or a philosophy. Celebrating holidays or performing rituals is not necessary to being a Buddhist, and Buddhist holidays and rituals exist to satisfy certain human needs of the many who are seeking Nirvana, or the cessation of dukkha.

The only thing Buddhism requires, (I'm still semi-quoting here) is that one follow the eight fold path set out by the Buddha.

End quote.

This is in the theraveda tradition of course. Also one might consider the five precepts of: no harming life, no adultery, no lying, no theft, and (no intoxicating drink, I think) as necessary to being a Buddhist.

I think personally that following the 8fold path is a sure fire way to be more happy whether you want to call yourself a Buddhist or not.",Buddhism,1388986789.0,t3_1uip5y,0.5,0

need help to write a sci-fi buddhist exorcist team and also weapons as a writer and learning more about buddhism culture for a story,"Hello I am working on a sci-fi fantasy story and I am writing a space organization that fights demons from space, the organization uses religious exorcism inspired weapons to fight demons. I am writing two teams so far which are the Christian exorcism team and the buddhist exorcism team. The christian exorcism team uses solid electricity weapons that is blessed by priests so that the weapons can have a holy water affect to the demons when they get hit.

And for the buddhist exorcism team, I am having trouble writing their weapons without trying to be offensive. I am aware that in buddhism, they dont believe in demons instead they believe the evil energy curropting the person and they use rituals to remove that evil from the person (correct me if Im wrong, sorry).

Critical Buddhism,"For me the main issue where I am questioning to which extent to embrace Buddhism, or want to engage more, is in how far Buddhism is willing to question itself? From my experience the answer is often a very firm no, but sometimes I wonder if that represents mainstream voices that drawn out the more discerning ones.

The obvious one is questioning statements or views of authoritative voices within Buddhism (particularly the Buddha). Scientifically when a being exist in a pre-rational, pre-scientific culture the chances they say little or nothing questionable seem very low indeed.

From a mythical perspective one would be inclined to find a ""true"" interpretation instead, but I think that is not a practical view to hold on to.

In general this issue seems to be more or less taboo, so an approach of reverential reception / belief is taken with regards to ancient text?

I would be glad to your input on this, especially concerning specific movements, groups or individual that take a skeptical and discerning view on Buddhist thought and practice, preferably without creating a mere secularized or modern-pragmatic approach which in my view sacrifices some important aspects.",Buddhism,1656754852.0,t3_vpo4ga,0.53,1

Do we believe in ‚Äúreality shifting‚Äù,Okay so basically some people asked this question on Reddit but they ask as if they want to go to Harry Potter. But I‚Äôm going to try to explain it. They are asking if reality shifting exists with 2 different ways. Way 1 is the shifting of your personal perception. So like full on experiencing there is not self to truly believe it. Way 2 is seeing something. Aka ‚ÄúI tried shifting and shifted to a random land and a random silhouette told me I wasn‚Äôt ready‚Äù type of thing. I‚Äôve seen experiences and also people shifting to meet someone. On tiktok people want to meet draco but a lot of Buddhists specifically pure landers want to see/meet Amitabha Buddha. Definitely people have exploited it into something only to get married there but the people on the sub Reddit probably aren‚Äôt asking that. This comes from a state of deep meditation and one of the main people who promoted it was someone who was inspired by both Hinduism and Buddhism and actually called reality shifting subconscious lifting saying that shifting is ‚Äúsubconscious realization‚Äù understanding there is no self and that there are ways to get out of our main view aka seeing the sky the rocks beginning of space etc. some believe in different universes or a place where they chose a different choice than they actually chose and they see the chain of events that happened because of that.

Rejection of rebirth by Buddhadasa,"Buddhadasa rejected the notion of rebirth and karma doctrine since it is incompatible with sunyata.

To him, what is rebirth is not the self, as self cannot be found even right now (sunyata).

But what is rebirth is the notion of I, the notion of self.

As what is rebirth is actually a notion, an ignorance, this doesn't fit to be called rebirth.

Because rebirth is understood to be a birth of self, instead of the birth of ignorance.

The concept of rebirth just doesn't match in case of ignorance.

This is true, isn't it?

If we see Buddhist Patticasammupadda, did Buddha ever mention it is self that rebirth? Never. You cannot find such thing whether in Pali or Mahayana.

What Buddha explain is the cause of rebirth, which is ignorance. The rebirth is the sense of I, not the actual self. 

Just like we see a mirage and the delusion of water appears. That delusion of water is the rebirth. That stupidity, that ignorance of that is water is the one that reappears again, again and again.

The whole process of rebirth doesn't involve any self or any atman or any soul. How can we then say there is rebirth? 

Rebirth of soul? Rebirth of Atman? Rebirth of self?

Rebirth is a language of atman, we can't use it for anatman. It is just not compatible.",Buddhism,1617083477.0,t3_mg9450,0.53,1

Jesus as a Bodhisattva,"He expressed so much compassion, and contrary to what modern churches teach, he was teaching self knowledge and that we are All children of God. Not just Him, all of us have his potential, the meaning just got garbled by councils of theologians controlled by politicians.
This sounds a LOT like Buddha Nature to me. Don't see it?  Check out esoteric chrisiantys view on Who Jesus is, and who we can become.
Given that the God of mystical Jew's(ain soph) has been compared often to the dharmakaya,
It could be said that Jesus' references to God are not Wrong View, just skillful means when talking to the patriarchal lineage focused Hebrews at that time. 

From this perspective, it seems obvious to me, that Jesus was an emanation of Avalokiteshvara. If one accepts that, then they can be a Buddhist christian imo. Mixing Jesus' teachings with Mahayana seems skillful for helping heap places like America.

"Trouble finding Buddhist materials that aren't lumped in with ""woo"".","There are a lot of folks who include Buddhism as part of a mishmash of spiritual philosophies, and due to this, it can be hard to find music, books, and other stuff that is strictly Buddhist and isn't just general ""New Age"".

I used to be into all of that stuff many years ago, but went completely atheist and abadoned everything. Now, I'm getting into mindfulness and am focused on dealing with the causes of my own suffering but have zero interest in going back to all the extraneous stuff like tarot, crystals, etc. 

Anyone else in a similar position, and how are you going about it?

Edit: several comments are mentioning materialism. I'm not materialistic. I don't need much at all. I just want mindfulness, not fluff. That's all. :)

Edit 2: I just realized some of you might be using the word ""materialism"" to describe a lack of belief in the supernatural. If that's the case, then it's apt.

"Buddhism and connections to Spirituality (Pineal Gland, Astral Projection, etc)","So I was wondering what the Buddhist take on spiritual things such as the Pineal Gland (Third eye), and Astral Projections is. I seem to have this really unhealthy sort of obsession with these kind of things, but I have recently got really invested in wanting to learn about Buddhism, and I have decided to go out my way to practice as soon as I can.   

I truly believe in a lot of these things, and I often watch people on YouTube who touch on these subjects, such as Koi Fresco, and someone else I actually just discovered tonight called Ryan Cropper.  

Both of these guys seem to be into Buddhism themselves, and even have videos on the eightfold path and stuff like that.  

What is everyone's take on all this, do you believe in both Buddhist teachings and spirituality, or are you a true believe of just one? I suspect that believing in spiritual stuff would more be a mahayana buddhist thing, but I believe that anyone can count themselves as a buddhist and believe in literally anything they want. I say you can be a Buddhist yet still believe in a god (Not that I do).

I had a dream that I ate a magic bean that allowed me to meet God,"I dreamt I was walking through a supermarket when I noticed they were selling magic mushrooms. Entranced, I was curious about the similar products I might find in the same section. I noticed a variety of flavors of magic beans, all promising different virtues. The magic bean that really grabbed my attention was marketed to give me the clairvoyant power of knowing God's current location. I figured it was a good buy, so I grabbed a bag and went to the quick checkout line.

After I had made my purchase, I swallowed down a handful of these magic beans. The knowledge of God's location crept into my brain slowly, like the process of coming to understand an idea, until I had that, ""Oh! Of course!"" moment.

Once it had seeped through and became obvious, I was led by my curiosity to where God happened to be at the time, which of course wasn't far. He was halfway up a nearby tree -- the same kind I used to climb when I was a child. I approached the tree and could see only his legs hanging from the branches above me.

I was very familiar with climbing these kinds of trees from my childhood, so I climbed up to see him. I was met with the most ordinary face I've ever seen. He wasn't what you would expect God to look like. Just an average, middle aged man with a greying goatee. If it weren't for the magic bean I would have thought this was just an ordinary man. I remember thinking, ""He's just so... ordinary."" His closest resemblance is, strangely, [Tim Curry](http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MTQ2OTYwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzEzMTA1._V1_SX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg).

After a very short moment of looking at each other, as if reading my thoughts he responded (as politely as possible) ""Well I don't find you particularly interesting either."" And with a goofy grin, he flew off like a startled bird. 

As it turns out, it wasn't that big of a deal. He was just the epitome of mediocrity. And therein I learned the value of mediocrity.

A bee pooped here.,"This is a quote from the book called [Trespassing on Einstein's Lawn](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17834895-trespassing-on-einstein-s-lawn): 
> My father had once told me that when he was a teenager on summer vacation, he was lying on a hammock in the backyard of his family home, not two miles from the home in which he and my mother would later raise me, reading The Way of Zen. ‚ÄúThe book was talking about the illusion of the ego,‚Äù my father had told me, ‚Äúand the duality of subject and object. I was totally blown away by this idea, which was so simple and yet so profound. It had such an effect on me that I became hyperaware of everything around me. I was so in the moment. And then a bee landed on the page and pooped on it and then flew away. So I circled the stain on the page and wrote in the margin, ‚ÄòA bee pooped here.‚Äô¬†‚Äù When he told me that story, I found myself wondering what I would have done if a bee had shat on my teenage reading, which was pretty much the opposite of everything Zen. Most likely I would have circled the stain in my Sartre and written, ‚ÄúFigures.‚Äù But the funny thing is, unbeknownst to my father, when I had snuck out of this house to get my first tattoo at the age of fourteen, I had, amidst my existentialism and angst, gotten a tattoo of the Chinese character for Zen, which looked like a little Hawaiian man carrying a tiki torch on my hip, because even though I was rebelling, I really just wanted to be like my father, to have the kind of subterranean wisdom I saw lurking behind his eyes, which were large and brown and sloped downward at the edges so that he appeared perpetually sleepy or stoned, eyes I had inherited from him and regarded not as mere genetic facsimile but as a secret handshake.

On downvoting,"The downvoting button tells us that we should click if we believe that the contribution that somebody has taken time to write adds nothing to **any** discussion.

Invariably, it is used just because somebody has written something that the downvoter does not agree with.

Are we looking for a community with *no* critical thought at all? Do we want a virtual sangha where everybody says the same thing? Is it right speech, right thought, right action to deprive others of alternative viewpoints? 

Most recently, I wrote [a reply saying that I didn't believe in rebirth](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/3hrkfp/how_does_rebirth_work_ive_used_the_search_bar/cuacp0t). Within minutes, it was downvoted. There was no attempt to discuss the issue with me; nor was there any rebuttal of the points that I was making. Just an anonymous downvote - an opinion that the post I had typed out made no contribution to any discussion. 

I avoid downvoting and only do so when someone writes something which is solely offensive to others: ""you self-righteous asshole"" or something similar. Otherwise, I'd prefer to engage people in discussion - the idea being that through discussion, I either consolidate what I believe or I find myself questioning myself anew. This is what I came to reddit to do.

I've asked myself how much of this new thread is just ego reacting to being criticised. There is some of that, I am sure. But there is also a feeling that we do ourselves a disservice by voting down content that we disagree with. There is also a doubt that this is compatible with the buddhism that so many here claim to practise. There is also a sense that we can only benefit from talking to each other rather than lazily clicking a blue flower. 

Am I alone in thinking this?

After doing semen retention for 7 days I must say that you may as well make it a precept to refrain from porn and masturbation.,"Hello,

As Buddhists if we are to say that taking intoxicants is going against one of the 5 precepts, then we should include porn. I know the damage done by drugs/alcohol on our awareness and meditative efforts. However, a life without porn and masturbation is so beneficial to meditation that I almost feel it should be a precept. 

It‚Äôs a little bonkers how much porn and masturbation effects ones meditation and general well being in life. I agree you can make meditative progress while masturbating to pork but same could be said with drinking a few drinks in the evening. 

I‚Äôm just saying if you‚Äôre a serious practitioner of Buddhism hisim meditation and see the benefit of not drinking alcohol/drugs, then refrain from porn and masturbation to its just as damaging to ones progress. 

Not sleeping on comfortable beds, fasting on one meal a day, music, movies don‚Äôt even touch the benefit of refraining from porn and masturbation.

A lot of denialism about this cause of our sexual liberal society. Its also a vice we are most attached too and people get butt hurt hearing this.

If you feel stuck in your spiritual life/meditation give semen retention a shot. And buddhists should promote this more.",Buddhism,1701276447.0,t3_186txmx,0.4,0
"If Buddhists consider plants to be living creatures, then why can they eat them?","I thought Buddhists were vegetarian because of the precept ""Don't take life."" But plants are as alive as animals. Why doesn't vegetarianism violate the precept?

EDIT: thank you everyone for the healthy debate. I did not come here to insult your beliefs, but rather to gain a deeper understanding so that I may come to terms with my own perspective on life, and include or exclude what I must in order to live like a Buddha. It sounds like some Buddhists eat meat, and others do not. I can't really see anything wrong with either decision, so long as the former opts out of killing the animal itself, or ordering it to be killed for them. The main point here is compassion, which so many of you have emphasized. However, it is true that the Dali Lama eats meat, and if anyone has enlightenment, it's him. I am more of a zen Buddhist, although I don't like to associate with any particular religion or sect because it only enhances the ego. You've all given me a lot to think about, and I appreciate the responses. Thank you, and have a happy holiday season!

Edit 2: I thought this discussion was done, but I'm still getting responses in my mailbox. I believe that my question is philosophical in nature, and revolves around the definition of the word ""pain."" There is scientific evidence that plants do respond negatively to pain, but because they have no nervous system they do not feel it in the same way that we do. That being said, we can never truly know if they ""feel"" anything. My bottom line is this: the philosopher Alan Watts once asked an enlightened friend of his that if he knew plants suffer, why does he even eat plants?

Buddhist Christians Cannot Exist,"I don't know why this concept is such a thing (I have suspicions). 

Jesus of Nazareth said: ""I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me"". This is not ambiguous. If you believe in him ( are a christian) then you already have the complete path to truth in Jesus. Why would you feel the need to supplement or improve God's teachings with those of a random non-christian monk? (whose teachings are often directly contradictory to those of the church!) 

On the other hand, if you do not believe what he said, and think he was a normal guy (or secret arahant) who still claimed to be the Son of God, then you must believe that he was either a great fool or a great liar. In either case, why would you want to associate with him at all?

To the argument that ""Buddhism is more of a philosophy than a religion"" and so can coexist with theist religion: If a philosophy disagrees with nothing, it is not saying anything. And what does Buddhism say, after you remove every single spiritual or religious idea? ""Don't be greedy""? ""Be mindful""? Christianity and even human common sense already that that much covered. To be clear, I am not saying Buddhism or its followers are devoid of content, only that some people act like it is.

I can think of two reasons one might be drawn to the idea of being a ""Buddhist christian"". More cynically, that they are not very knowable about the doctrine of either faith, and are not interested in devout practice of anything, but still have a need to be ""spiritual"" . Like say someone who was raised Catholic, but is bored of going to the same church every week, so they spice up their weekend by going to a Buddhist temple instead; taste some exotic orientalism.

More generously, maybe people claim to be multiple religions to promote tolerance between cultures. A noble goal, but the language of Buddhist Christianity subtlety damages the Church. All peoples are equal, but truths are not.  It would be better to completely abandon God and switch to Buddhism than to stay a christian in name only.

This is disappointing,"**If you are going to read this, please read it completely before voting.**

r/Buddhism, I've been disappointed by you.

You have turned r/Buddhism into a narrow and obstructed view of Buddhism, thus, no buddhism at all. This forum is both attached to death talk, to problem talks, to motivational talks and to pseudo-intelectual talks, among others... Some of these things are in nature good but, the way you are using them is going to get old soon enough in your life and in this forum.

Again, [All wisdom in all buddhism is one, universal and true, always](http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/kuclo/all_wisdom_in_all_buddhism_is_one_universal_and/) and [Buddhism doesn't tell you what you want to hear, Buddhism tells you what it is](http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/kte88/buddhism_doesnt_tell_you_what_you_want_to_hear/).

Those of you who tell me that I have no authority and that have much complains about me, first of all let me tell you that in Buddhism there has always been a **very strong** respect to teachers. If you want to be Buddhist you have to respect the Buddha. I'm a direct disciple of Shaolin, thus in the direct line of disciples of Shakyamuni. Even my worse word has great value. Those of you who can't understand that and expect me to sugar coat everything and to be the face of sugar and to make you feel good about yourself by saying everything like asking for permission, I only can tell you that I'm very sorry for your false expectations and I won't live up to them. You should read again the sutras, you should read again the history of all Buddhist teachers and you will find a lot of surprises in relation to severity of the teachers and their ways. In comparison, my tones, even the ugliest ones, are nothing.  Independently, you should know that **feeling bad about yourself or your acts is the only way you will ever change something in your behavior, it's as much part of the process as feeling good about yourself until equanimity is achieved**.

**Now, I'm warning you: You still think like americans. You think of Buddhism like you think of a car: If I like it, I buy it. If the teacher does and says what I like, I hear him. If it makes me feel better, I think it. If it sounds reasonable to me, I give it a chance.**

But now I ask you, how if you only hear what you like, if you only think what makes you feel better and you only give a chance to what sounds reasonable to you in your current state, how then, are you going to change? Analyze this and you will discover that this sub-reddit is setting up the base of stagnation.

Now. I've never asked anything out of you. I gave you many teachings and posts which many of you said ""this is great, thanks a lot, it really helped me"". You even asked that one of them were on [the right bar](http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/ir691/a_faq_for_people_new_to_buddhism/). I've even offered you a chance to come with us to China and meet the masters there... [But now people are even insulting me and challenging me after all of my work here... and what's even worse, you approve this with your votes](http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/kte88/buddhism_doesnt_tell_you_what_you_want_to_hear/c2n52q4).

If you don't trust me, fine. I can deal with that. But the truth is that I can't teach people who don't trust me, nor any other teacher in the world could. Without trust you can't let something new in your life, and without anything new, you will start to decay.

I will tell you that I'm not going to change my ways, this because my ways aren't like so just for personal gratification, they are like that because in that way they teach what they need to teach. This is the way I got what I got, and some things can't be transferred in any other form. 

So, how do I mean for this to be solved? I will ask you a very simple thing:

**If you agree with what I'm saying in this post, I will only ask you that, next time, instead of saying ""I don't agree with this"" and then simply proceed to either offend me, fight me, attempt to discredit me, bother me in any way or downvote me... you first ask politely, without sarcasm, without nicknames: ""This is what I understood from what you wrote, am I reading it right?"", and you do so each time the thought ""this wrong"" comes up to your mind and the urge to rebate comes to your brain.**

**When I tell you ""yes, you got it right"",  then, and only then you rightfully say ""I don't agree with this"". If I don't, you accept that you didn't got it right and since that is the case, you can't neither agree or disagree with something you don't even got. Ok?**

If you tell me right now that you guys can't do this small thing that I'm asking, nothing happens, we are still friends, but one things is for sure: this is my last post in this forum because attempting to teach you anything will be mostly impossible for the reasons I've already explained and furthermore I don't want to contribute to the base of stagnation that you are implementing right now and your self-serving, self-revering, self-gratification attitude. This will only result in me wearing off, and you getting angry against me and/or what I claim to represent.

I hope it's not the case tho. Wait for your reply. Also, if you agree with this, you should apply this procedure to everyone else, not just with me.

"If ""life is suffering"", and Buddhism's goal is to eliminate suffering, shouldn't Buddhists just kill themselves?","Other faiths present various arguments that discourage suicide, while Buddhism - as far as I can tell - does not. For instance, in Christianity, suicide is immoral and ineffective: it is a sin, for which you will suffer eternally in the afterlife, so it makes no sense as means to escape suffering in this life.

In Buddhism, on the other hand, there is no afterlife, and the first Noble Truth (Dukkha) stipulates that existence necessarily leads to suffering, while earthly happiness is always ambivalent, temporary, and inevitably reverts back to pain and dissatisfaction.

Even believers of literal reincarnation hold that different incarnations aren't normally aware of each other. Thus, once we kill ourselves, according to Buddhism, that is the end - we will not be consciously aware of our past choice to kill ourselves, and even if we are, the natural remedy is to kill ourselves again...

Taken altogether, suicide would seem like a viable way to end personal suffering for good, without any possibility of punishment following it. Seeing as existence is suffering and lasting happiness is only possible through nibbƒÅna - an exceedingly difficult and rare achievement - why, according to Buddhism, should one not take the simple path and kill oneself?

P.S. I do not encourage suicide by anyone, including myself; this is a theoretical question about the views of Buddhism.",Buddhism,1495823734.0,t3_6dit2v,0.55,4
The Concept of Self as Expressed in MahƒÅyƒÅna MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa S≈´tra,"INTERNATIONAL BUDDHIST COLLEGE Arkady Fayngor Professor Dr. Fa Qing ME6102 Mahayna Buddhism 27 February 2013

The Concept of Self as Expressed in MahƒÅyƒÅna MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa S≈´tra


MahƒÅyƒÅna MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ a S≈´tra is one of the most famous text of MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism devoted to the positive affirmation of the eternal Self (or True Self) as opposed to impermanent non- self. The S≈´tra belongs to the group of Buddhist texts known as the ;TathƒÅgatagarbha S≈´tras As with the majority of MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras, the actual date of its creation is unknown.


Hajime Nakamura believes that ‚Äúit must have been compiled in the period 200-400 A.D.‚Äù (212). There are several existing translations of MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ a S≈´tra: ‚Äúthe shortest and earliest extant translated version is the translation into Chinese by Faxian and Buddhabhadra in six juan (418CE); the next in terms of scriptural development is the Tibetan version (c790CE) by Jinamitra, J√±ƒÅnagarbha and Devacandra; and the lengthiest version of all is what is known as the ‚ÄúNorthern version‚Äù in 40 juan by Dharmaksema (422CE)‚Äù (Page 1). 

In MahƒÅyƒÅna tradition the s≈´tra is believed to be the last teaching of the Buddha before entering into ParinirvƒÅna Although MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ a S≈´tra discusses various topics related to MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhist doctrine and practices, the particular attention of the present paper is given to the notion of True Self that is expressed in the S≈´tra. The great specialty of MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ a S≈´tra lies in the fact that it equates the Buddha-nature or tathƒÅgatagarbha present in every living being with the Self: ‚Äúformerly, Buddhism, advocating the theory of Non-ego, was against the theory of ƒÅtman, but here in this scripture the Buddha teaches the theory of Great ƒÄtman‚Äù (Nakamura 213). The Buddha explains in Chapter 12 of MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ a S≈´tra as follows: ""O good man! Self means Tathagatagarbha"" [Buddha-Womb, Buddha-Embryo, Buddha-Nature]. Every being has Buddha-Nature. This is the Self. Such Self has, from the very beginning, been under cover of innumerable defilements‚Äù (101). Equating tathƒÅgatagarbha with ƒÅtman is not only found in MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ a S≈´tra, but also in Avata saka S≈´tra. Buddha gives the following characteristics to the notion of Self: ‚ÄúThe Self (ƒÅtman) is reality (tattva), the Self is permanent (nitya), the Self is virtue (guna), the Self is eternal (≈õƒÅ≈õvatƒÅ), the Self is stable (dhruva), the Self is peace (siva)‚Äù Such a notion of eternal True Self is explained in opposition to the concept of non-self, which is our mistaken idea of ego: ‚Äúin contrast to our individual ego, Buddhism points us towards the Great Self which is the presence of the Dharma-Body in all of us, also known as Buddha-nature‚Äù **(Paraskevopoulos 23). MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa S≈´tra clearly defines what belongs to the realm of selflessness and what possesses the True Self: ‚ÄúNon-Self is Samsara, the Self is the Tathagata; impermanence is the sravakas and pratyekabuddhas, the Eternal is the Tathagata‚Äôs Dharmakaya; suffering is all tirthikas, Bliss is Nirvana; the impure is all compounded [samskrta] dharmas, the Pure is the true Dharma that the Buddha and Bodhisattvas have‚Äù** (29). Of course, such an exposition is rather unusual for the disciples of the Buddha who were previously trained by the TathƒÅgata to practice the contemplation on non-self. They express their perplexity and question the Buddha further. The answer given by the TathƒÅgata is rather definitive: ‚ÄúEven though he has said that all phenomena [dharmas] are devoid of the Self, it is not that they are completely/truly devoid of the Self. What is this Self? Any phenomenon <br> [dharma] that is true [satya], real [tattva], eternal [nitya], sovereign/autonomous/self-governing

[aisvarya], and whose ground/foundation is unchanging [asraya-aviparinama], is termed ‚Äôthe Self‚Äô [atman]‚Äù(32). **Such a reply seems to have no room for any other interpretation but the literal one. The Buddha cautions his disciples not to fall into a one-sided view of seeing only emptiness and suffering in everything, which he compares with taking stones for gems.**  He further instructs to ‚Äústudy well the Way, how to act, wherever you go, and ‚Äúmeditate on the Self, the Eternal, Bliss, and the Pure‚Äù (30). To illustrate this idea, the Buddha tells the simile of the King and the Skillful Doctor in Chapter 3 called ‚ÄúOn Grief‚Äù. In very short rendering, this simile talks about the skillfulness of the Doctor who first prohibited to cure all sicknesses with a milk medicine, because such was the practice of an unskilled doctor before him. However, later on when the King himself got ill, the Doctor prescribed him the milk medicine, since he saw that it can help the King. **In the same way the Buddha first wanted to subdue the unskillful methods of the teachers before him by saying ‚Äúthere is no self, no man, no being, no life, no nurturing, no knowing, none that does, and none that receives‚Äù (MMPNS 32). A very significant sentence uttered by the Buddha right after that explains why he teaches the doctrine of non- self: ‚ÄúThis is to adjust beings and because he is aware of the occasion.‚Äù Therefore, the idea of non-self is used by the Buddha as skillful means to adjust to the level of understanding of his disciples.** It is explained in Chapter 12: ‚ÄúEngaging in the notion that there is no Self with regard to the mundane self, they do not understand the skilful words of implicational purport of the TathƒÅgata ‚Ä¶ They have the notion that there is no Self and are unable to know the True Self‚Äù (Page 3-4). In the Chapter 10 ‚ÄúOn The Four Truths‚Äù, the Buddha further warns his disciples of the wrong view of applying the characteristics of impermanent Samsara to the eternal domain of TathƒÅgata: ‚ÄúAny person who says that the Three Treasures are non-eternal and holds this view of life, then this is a false way of practice and is not the noble truth of the Way‚Äù (98). Such a person ‚Äúannuls what is right and won‚Äôt allow it to live. On account of this, that person does not know ‚ÄúDharmata‚Äù [essence of Reality]. Not knowing this, he repeats birth and death and suffers greatly‚Äù (97). **The Tibetan version of MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ a S≈´tra contains even a greater caution in the same chapter: ‚ÄúBy having cultivated non-Self with reference to the tathƒÅgata-dhƒÅtu and having continually cultivated Emptiness, suffering will not be eradicated, but one will become like a moth in the flame of a lamp‚Äù.** Based on the above, we can see that, as claimed by the MahƒÅyƒÅna tradition, the final teaching of the Buddha before entering into ParinirvƒÅna, has a very radical position on the Self. Although the Buddha did not deny the traditional characterization of all dharmas belonging to the world of Samsara as impermanent, suffering, selfless and impure, such characteristics must not be applied to the domain of NirvƒÅna According to Williams, ‚ÄúThis s≈´tra is quite categoric in asserting that the error here lies in looking in the wrong direction ‚Äì in other words that finally there is an equal error in seeing impermanence where there is permanence, suffering where there is happiness, not-Self where there is Self, and impurity where there is purity, in failing to see the positive element in Buddhahood which contrasts with the negative realm of unenlightenment‚Äù (109). Nakamura states that the origins of such a position ‚Äúcan be traced to ancient times... a precursor of the concept of Buddhahood can be noticed even in Abhidharma MahƒÅvibhƒÅ a ≈öƒÅstra ·π£ ‚Äù (213). The TathƒÅgatagarbha S≈´tras in general talk about the Buddha-Nature as existing in all living beings, but in the case of earlier S≈´tras, prior to MahƒÅparinirvƒÅna S≈´tra, it was used more in a sense of describing the inherent potential in all beings to become a Buddha.

Although the purport of the teaching on the Self in MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ a S≈´tra is the subject of an ongoing debate among the scholars , it undoubtedly explains the concept of True Self. Williams writes that ‚Äúthe MahƒÅparinirvƒÅna S≈´tra teaches a really existing, permanent element ... in sentient beings. It is this element which enables sentient beings to become Buddhas‚Äù. In whichever way we can understand

the notion of True Self, it is absolutely clear that MahƒÅparinirvƒÅna S≈´tra represents the positive aspect of the reality of NirvƒÅna and TathƒÅgata which is frequently forgotten or overlooked in the field of Buddhist studies and practice.

before you start pointing fingers, work on your own attachments which could cause such an incident, rather than pointing fingers at all others as a way to fix it.

historically, and even today to some degree, buddhism was split into lay people and monastics because you have to have time to dedicate every single day towards meditation, and that isn't counting in retreat. I think in Seon/Zen every single day, monks practice at least 3 hours of meditation. 8 months out of the year, there is retreat, where its closer to 10-12. 

The point is not to make people feel bad. But hatred, violence, biogtry...these are super ingrained habits in being human! its not as simple as just saying one day, ""well, I'm not going to do that anymore."" if it was, these incidents wouldn't happen.

Countless are woman's defects. 
My elephantine mind has fallen 
Into the poisonous swamp of guile. 
So I must renounce the world. 
- Naropa, Tibetan mystic poet 

Some say that learning seems not tobe the business of women. I say that . . . control of the mind is of theutmost importance to women, and it would be a great mistake to say that itis not their business. The outward manner and temper of women is rooted in the negative (yin) power, and so temperamentally women are apt to be sensitive, petty, narrow, and jaundiced. Confinement results in limited vision. Consequently, among women compassion and honesty are rare indeed. That is why Buddhism says that women are particularly sinfuland have the greatest difficulty in attaining Buddhahood. Thus women are in special need of mental discipline. 
- Toju, Zen Master

The satanic bible,"I don‚Äôt know how I came across it, but I bought the satanic bible- might have kissed it (at the time I really liked how it pointed out hypocrisy) and read about 40 pages but it triggered an intense rage where I blew up verbally on 2 of my family members for things they did in the past (I come from a family practicing Islam.)

After that fact, I felt horrible and threw away the book and that was about a year ago. I stopped practicing Islam several years ago and go to a Buddhist temple by me as well as meditate at times and more recently am trying to read up on more compassion and general kindness. 

Since coming from an Islamic background, I cannot shake this horrible feeling that I lost a piece of my soul simply possessing the satanic bible. Again I‚Äôve tried to forgive myself and I will certainly never touch an occult book like that again. Even though I feel Islam isn‚Äôt for me, I want to say it respectfully. I was saying some really nasty things about God when I possessed that book and was being very prideful. I‚Äôve since apologized outwardly wto their God and felt that was a very nasty thing to do.

Christopher lee has a video on YouTube where he says to not touch occult books because people lose their mind and soul. I have this terrible fear and haven‚Äôt slept well in a week thinking I have to go back to Islam and repent- which I‚Äôve been doing and it‚Äôs still horrible.

I simply want to acknowledge that I know I made a mistake - again I threw away the book- and forgive myself and move on.

But my closest family members - I couldn‚Äôt imagine if I told them- so now I feel I have this horrific little secret I can‚Äôt share with anyone.

Secular Buddhism: Not a noble path,"One of the things that fascinates me about a transcendence-denying reading of the teachings of the suttas is that it requires so many things that otherwise fit together very nicely to be interpreted as craftily encoded by the Buddha. From the concept of world-transcendence to kamma, to rebirth, to pain, to old age, to disease and death (as included explicitly in the definition of dukkha) to dukkha overall to deathlessness, to the self, to self-refuge, Nibbana, Brahman...the list goes on and on of things that the secular Buddhist must say the Buddha didn't really mean to say in those terms at all. What he meant, they continually have to assert, is that when he uses these terms that resemble ideas from a mystical teaching, he has really just borrowed them as perhaps hyperbolic symbols of a wholly secular system of ""salvation."" Even liberation or salvation itself doesn't really mean liberation unless one is able to decode it and what one is liberated from correctly, it just means perception of conditionality and psychological adjustment to it as reality. In other words, to successfully decode the Buddhadhamma for the secularist, we almost only need to reverse the meaning. Liberation means knowing you are not really free, self refers to what is not self, Parinibbana means extinction, etc. What is remarkable about this tremendous work of interpretation is that it is never found to be decoded as such by the Buddha himself in the suttas, and this is remarkable because the Buddha of the suttas is famously very good at explaining the detailed meaning of the terms he chooses to use. For example, if you want to see what he means by ""birth,"" he tells us quite plainly that it means being born in the usual sense (whether from an egg or from a womb, etc), not an abstraction. And he says that this happens to the worldling after death. And if you want to know what he means by death in that kind of statement, he explains that too. And it's nothing so abstract...it means simply death in the usual sense that people die at the end of their life. And so on....So the secular decoding of the Buddha's teaching occurs wholly in the enlightened too-modern imagination of the secularist who, being too reasonable to believe in spooks, must, if they are to continue to be interested in Buddhism, be convinced that the Buddha was a secular agnostic. ~ Vacca, [The Zennist](http://zennist.typepad.com/zenfiles/2011/03/secular-buddhism-not-a-noble-path.html)",Buddhism,1417497352.0,t3_2o0omy,0.57,8
The Modern Outlook on Mental Health is a Scam,"The western world is finally putting some attention onto the state of our mental well-being but to no surprise it's methods lead to weaker self-esteem and an increase in medication. If people were to properly understand dependent origination they would be able to spot, with clear eyes, where their issues begin and how they snowball. As it currently stands the way these ""deficiencies"" are presented leads teens and young adults to ""accept"" they are depressed, have anxiety, bi-polar, etc. which leads them to label themselves as such. The label itself insinuates the deficiency is a part of their biology, they were just born like this, or past abuse cemented it. All this does is de-motivate the individual from investigating why they feel the way they do. That entire thought process is removed from the present moment and stuck in thoughts of the past. 

As it stands now, people are encouraged to delve deep into their past but they stop after that. This encourages a victim mentality, leaving people clueless about the most important fact: all that there is, is this current moment. The past does not exist. This constant state of change allows everything to happen, including you cutting off the causes that lead to certain thoughts from arising. The reason you are fully in control of your experience is because you have the possibility of changing what comes and goes within your mind. The thoughts aren't you, they simply show up because the recipe for them was assembled. Learn to prevent this assembly by watching your thoughts. Be an observer, train your mind to not run away with these thoughts, and most importantly realize they aren't ""you"". Every single thing that happened to you in your life doesn't make ""you"" either, but it did effect your mind's thoughts. This is the practical application of the No Self teaching. Too many people think they are their mind, so when they notice it's such a mess, they naturally think they are a mess as well, preventing any chance of discovering the mind is trainable like a muscle. 

It is frustrating that so many people live in hell and feel helpless about their situation, ignoring a universal law that is dependent origination. One solves their relationship with mental health when they contemplate the 4NTs, where the ""aha!"" moment comes and you realize just how deep and multi-faceted the teachings really are.",Buddhism,1662256507.0,t3_x5axgs,0.4,0
Buddhism without devas or deities.,"I've been practicing bhuddhism for a while, but I do not believe in all the deities, devas and demons.

Is there sect of Buddhism that doesn't include them in their teachings or is it something I just have to exclude from my own beliefs while practicing? Or even just books of teachings I can read that don't include them? I'm currently reading an Anthology of discourse form the Polish Canon by Bhikkhu Bodhi and there is alot of focus on them.

Why is Buddhism so sex negative?,"I‚Äôve done my reading and spent my time reading what people on this subreddit have to say- and frankly i‚Äôm still lost and discouraged. It seems any buddhist who just simply explain how overindulgence and irritation for something we want is all that you need to be mindful of and things like sex aren‚Äôt a bad thing. Yet it seems plenty more just want everyone to live a celibate life- even if you have no plans to be a monk. 

Why does buddhism give me the impression time and time again sex is this evil act that can only have one purpose and is something that should never be done ever? *And yes i‚Äôm aware plenty may just explain about the cycle of birth and reincarnation- i know all that. but that‚Äôs not what i‚Äôm asking for really. Cause that‚Äôs only going to resonate with a monk, not your everyday person who just wants to live a good life and not deprive themselves of everything life has to offer.  

Sure sex isn‚Äôt a Need like food and sleep- no one dies from never having sex. But why is it buddhists say that and then go on to say ‚Äúbecause of this you should never do it as it is meaningless.‚Äù

Sex is more than just babies. Sex wouldn‚Äôt feel good just for the sake of making sure people kept getting knocked up. So why this back and forth with buddhists stating from their own readings that sex is either a good and healthy thing or a vile and bad thing?

Hell, I could argue having sex just because your biological body tells you to procreate is worse than non procreative sex because at least non procreative sex could just be that bonding loving connection between two people, and not just some biological command. Anyone after menopause can still have sex and a desire for that sexual connection/intimacy, it‚Äôs just some don‚Äôt feel the need as much as strongly for as when they were younger. So why shame people into saying you shouldn‚Äôt have sex if you can‚Äôt get pregnant out of it? Half the people here can‚Äôt even agree if gay sex is bad. 

I‚Äôm not training to be a monk, so why is it this buddhist religion is telling me I need to be one? why are buddhists not taking into consideration any person of any orientation sees sex more as just a carnal desire? why do i not hear one buddhist talk about how wonderful making love to a partner is and how it‚Äôs good and not evil? Cause i read one too many on this subreddit alone that has no problem going into great detail how sex is just some dirty minded activity that should not exist ever- how a loving couple can‚Äôt ever make love when they ever so want to.

That Buddhism is a reformation of Hinduism is hereby refuted,"One of the convenient narratives of Western Indologists is that Hinduism was debased due to the caste system, and Gautama attempted to reform it and in doing so broke away from Hindu ideas and ideals.

At stake is the entire basis on which Hindu and Buddhist societies are organized. The claim made by Western Indologists is that Hinduism believes in a birth-based caste system (you are a Brahmin, Shudra, Kshatriya, etc., iff your parents are Brahmin, Shudra, Kshatriya, etc., respectively) while Buddhism repudiates the entire classification of people into four varnas and preaches against it.

In this post, I will refute this oft-made but mistaken claim.

----

My evidences are the following.

(1)In the Mahabharata, a serpent poses a question to Yudhishtra as to who is a Brahmin and who is a Shudra. Yudhishtra replies that one is a Brahmin by conduct and not by birth. A supposed ""shudra"" who has Brahmin-like qualities is a Brahmin. A supposed ""Brahmin"" who does not have the appropriate qualities is a shudra.

https://imgur.com/a/3zskb

>A Brahmin is one in whom truthfulness, charity, forgiveness, good conduct, lack of cruelty, self-control and compassion can be seen...If these traits, not even found in a Brahmin are seen in a shudra, he is not a shudra. A Brahmin in whom a brahmin's traits are not found, is a shudra...Before initiation into knowledge of the Vedas, everyone is a shudra by conduct.

(2)The Sonadanda Sutta records a conversation between a student and Buddha about the true qualities of a Brahmin. The full exchange can be found here:

http://buddhasutra.com/files/sonadanda_sutta.htm

The important paragraphs are:

>""Angaka is handsome, good-looking, pleasing, of supremely fair complexion, in form and countenance like Brahma, of no mean appearance, and there is none in this assembly his equal except the ascetic Gotama.  He is a scholar‚Ä¶I was his mantra-teacher.  He is well-born on both sides‚Ä¶I know his parents.  But if Angaka were to take life, take what is not given, commit adultery, tell lies and drink strong drinks - what would good looks, mantras, or birth profit him?  But it is because a Brahmin is virtuous‚Ä¶because he is wise‚Ä¶on account of these two points that he can truthfully declare:  ""I am a Brahmin.""

>""But, Brahmin, if one were to omit one of these two points, could one truthfully declare:  ""I am a Brahmin?""   ""No, Reverend Gotama.  For wisdom is purified by morality, and morality is purified by wisdom:  where one is, the other is, the moral man has wisdom and the wise man has morality, and the combination of morality and wisdom is called the highest thing in the world.  Just as one hand washes the other, or one foot the other, so wisdom is purified by morality and this combination is called the highest thing in the world.""

>""So it is, Brahmin.  Wisdom is purified by morality, and morality is purified by wisdom:  where one is, the other is, the moral man has wisdom and the wise man has morality, and the combination of morality and wisdom is called the highest thing in the world.

One cannot both be a capitalist and a buddhist,"In the most basic, inseparable way Capitalism requires the expropriation of surplus value produced by labor to be turned into private profit. This undeniably is a form of stealing. There would not be any profit if it were not for the reality of surplus value produced by the working class through wage slavery.

The basic mechanic of capitalist production is such that the normative relation between labor and production to meet human needs is completely rejected in favor of the endless growth model and profit drive (finance capital compounded for its own sake). Therefore capitalism is inherently defiled and anti-buddhist.

Additionally, capitalism is rooted in many other defined mindsets:
cynicism, egoism, self aggrandizement, usury, clinging to material possessions, utilitarianism, neglecting the poor and dispossessing people of basic necessities.

Capitalism reduces everyone to a unit of monetary value, or some cog in the equation of yielding profit for the owner class. Objectification, commodification, etc. are the crux of it.  And all this is done to fulfill the need of the ruling class to exploit.

This is all quite contrary to the buddhist path, and to defend capitalism is to defend delusion and wrong views but also to sanction the violence of oppressors upon the oppressed. Every eviction, homeless camp destroyed, mentally ill addict imprisoned and brutalized‚Ä¶ then add all the orwellian things business do to employees like censoring speech, loving them in a building to die in a tornado, forcing workers to urinate in bottles rather than use the restroom, Violently suppressing workers movements and strikes. etc etc etc.

The application of capitalism is violence.

Unfortunately capitalism and western bias have heavily distorted and co-opted buddhism with individualism mindfulness and self help junk.

Capitalists co-opt everything they can, and buddhism is no different. They distort buddhist teaching and water it down to the most ineffectual and harmless state. They have rendered buddhism into a cult of secular, therapeutic, self improvement, calming, sedating, placating entirety by which the ruling class can convince the oppressed class into accepting their exploitation and blaming themselves. 
Instead of calling out the exploiters for their misdeeds, capitalist buddhism has people believing that they should accept capitalism and all its problems as the natural state of things; and if you‚Äôre unhappy term is your own fault because ‚Äúwhat you think about you bring about.‚Äù
Mindfulness has became a means by which the bosses can get the workers to work more efficiently and more be more docile.

I have heard of the story of him addressing a Brahmin and talking about how he doesn't think it makes sense that a creator God exists, seeing as how there is free will and also that there is evil and suffering in the world.

The Buddha was great at thought/heart experiments. He was silent on so many questions including that of God in other dialouges. So why address it elsewhere? 

The Buddha's ethics were his focus. The Eightfold path aims to alleviate suffering. As others have pointed out, he often found metaphysics not useful. But I think it's a mistake for people to jump to insinuations about God/or no God as an endorsement on the matter.

Similarly, anatta is a discourse on attachement to self. Whether or not  there is a soul is not the issue. The obvious change we undergo day by day, year by year, is suggested as a reason not to feel attached to self.

Is everyone unhappy? Do buddhists say so?,"Hey all,

One thing that is making my head spin is that Buddhists seem to say that the only path in life is the path of enlightenment and that can truly set you free and grant happiness. 

The first noble truth is that life contains suffering. While I definitely know this to be true, and everyone suffers to some extent, i think there is a big bias in people that meditate and pursue it with great rigor.  

There are a lot of people who are suffering but are also a lot of times quite happy. There are definitely people who seem to be very present, see the good in people, love themselves and others, have good relationships and a fulfilling job and have meaning in their life - yet never meditated. Overall they seem happy. And if you ask them they would also say they are happy and love their life. I‚Äôve seen those people in all economic classes - from rich to poor.

I‚Äôm wondering why it seems (and please correct me if im wrong, im not certain lol) buddhists have the ‚Äòwisdom‚Äô to deny the above and say that everyone has suffering and cultivating the path is the only way to end suffering and therefore this is the only path. Some suffering combined with joy and fulfillment may be perfectly fine for a lot of people. It seems to me like buddhists say ‚Äòi know you say you are happy, but listen, you just haven‚Äôt introspected enough, you really contain a lot of suffering, you‚Äôre not happy trust me‚Äô. 

lets do a thought experiment. A perfectly happy construction worker with not the highest IQ (sorry for the generalization here) that loves working with his hands, loves himself, has compassion, has a lovely wife, looks forwards to having children, has a good group of buddies and generally feels well. Does he have suffering? Sure, like everyone. Life will not always go as planned, there is craving, disappointment, etc. But if you ask him on a random day ‚Äòhow happy are you?‚Äô He‚Äôd rate his day a 8.5/10. 

Now a buddhist comes along and says ‚Äòlook my friend, you are suffering, you may not know it, but you are, come to my monastery and devote yourself to Buddhism.‚Äô

I had a dream where I was getting baptised into Buddhism and I had no connection to it in real life. Do you know what it could be related to?,"Hi all. I feel I needed to ask this here. I'm not too familiar with this sub or Buddhism but I need help.

I had a dream I was getting baptised into Buddhism and in the dream I was instructed to throw myself into the water with force, the water needed to hit my face and body with force.
I was then told to stop using substances (in real life I only take herbs to help with dreaming and astral projection, nothing illegal or psychedelic). I was then told that I will become successful in business in due course, and that I need to focus on my career for now and business success will only happen later on in the course of my career ( again, I am frustrated with my job and jt downer pay that great and I am desperate to start and succeed at a business). When I checked the date later in the evening of the baptism in the dream, I realised it was actually my birthday (which is my real life birthday as well)

Before the dream ended(I think it was the folloing day in the dream), I saw myself walking with the lady who was baptising me and we were at this beautiful ,green apartment complex and a young boy pointed out how affordable the apartments were, I don't knkw these apartments in real life  but I remember seeing the board with the prices and indeeed they were quite affordable.

Looking for counter-arguments to my argument against rebirth,"**1.)** If rebirth is true, then one of these two (but not both) must also be true:

A) All beings are subject to rebirth. That means frogs, mosquitoes, mollusks, plants, and even single-celled organisms undergo rebirth.

B) Only some beings are subject to rebirth. That means at some point in evolution, an organism not subject to rebirth produced offspring that is subject to rebirth.

**2.)** Both A and B are intuitively nonsensical. In A, it's hard to make sense of what it would even mean for a single-celled organism or a plant to undergo rebirth. In B, it's hard to make sense of how a shift from non-rebirth-beings to rebirth-beings could possibly happen in biological evolution.

 **3.)** If A and B are nonsensical, then rebirth is nonsensical, too.

Contradictions I've noticed within this philosophy. Also I've come to the conclusion that the self does exist. Am I correct or just missing the point entirely?,"I'm not a Buddhist, but I have been meditating pretty consistently for about 2 years. I've been listening to some lectures about Buddhism in general so I probably don't know very much but I think I get the general idea. I'll keep it short.

The buddha talks about aversion as one of the things that keeps you suffering. Aversion is the avoidance of unpleasant feelings/thoughts/emotions, etc. Also desiring keeps you suffering as well. So... when you desire not to suffer and pursue buddhism... is that not considered both desire and aversion in itself? That makes absolutely zero sense. Avoiding leads to suffering but desiring to avoid suffering leads to not suffering when avoidance is the thing that leads to suffering. Its a paradox.

Secondly, he says that there is no concrete self and I have a gripe with this because its such an overly reductionist perspective that doesn't make sense either. I'm a science student and I also think in a reductionist mindset because that's what I want to study. So I get where mans is coming from, but I propose this. Everyone is familiar with the 5 aggregates, and if you separate them then that's just a bunch of other moving parts that are contributing to the sense of self but it doesn't really ""exist"" because it's just made up of a bunch of other parts that are not it. That's wrong though because humans are conscious, and do exist. If you didn't exist, you wouldn't be reading this. Life is just a bunch of moving parts that have smaller moving parts that have smaller moving parts. Humans have organs, and organs are made of cells. And cells are made of biomolecules. Biomolecules are made of atoms. You get the picture. If you take a couple of neurons, those are just neurons. String enough together you get the intelligence of a cat. Take 100 billion and that's a good ol' human brain. Buddha had the 5 aggregates basically correct to how psychology understands consciousness now, I don't like how he splits them up categorically and the language is fuzzy, but its pretty close. The self is the sum of its parts. It's not an illusion. The self exists. It's just a combination of the awareness bestowed to us by a bunch of cells tied up in super complex ways and the experiences those cells undergo as a human. The self is ever changing. Your body and mind are also ever changing but we still consider them to exist. We should do the same with the self. 

Buddhism is supposed to bring you peace but going this deep has brought me nothing but existential dread. Also predicating an entire way of living based on the subjective experience of 1 human that has cognitive biases like all the rest of us that has also been passed down and manipulated by other humans with their own cognitive biases sounds like a bit of a crazy thing to take as gospel truth. 

Please feel free to argue with me and try to change my perspective as I am open to scrutiny within my logic as I have scrutinized essentially the entirety of buddhism on a buddhism sub lmao.",Buddhism,1666393326.0,t3_ya7g1h,0.44,0
Lama Ole: How can we maintain the pure view?," I recently saw this posted on facebook.

I thought it was really poignant and clear, and worth sharing.

&#x200B;

How can we maintain the pure view?

Lama Ole‚Äôs answer:

Imagine your mind is a cigar factory. You are only producing cigars for millionaires, twenty dollars apiece. You check their color and smell; you check the sound they make when you squeeze them. If they are good enough you accept them, if not you send them off to be processed into cigarettes or loose tobacco.

That is exactly what it‚Äôs about‚Äîonly accepting the best thoughts and feelings. One could also say that there should be something pure in everything that has to do with you. On the highest level, samsara and nirvana are one. Every atom vibrates with joy and is held together by love. Every thought and feeling, even the most stupid, is fantastic on the absolute level just because it can happen.

If you make sure to feel good, you will experience the world as beautiful‚Äîeverything as wonderful and meaningful. Remember that everybody has innate buddha nature. Decide to experience everything as fresh and new and to see the beauty in all that happens.

It is important to understand that highest truth means highest joy. My mind works in a very simple way: I have an automatic function, a discarding function. If there is something that feels bad or strange, my mind tells me, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to worry about that; there is no truth in it. It must be a mistake in today‚Äôs manufacturing process or some kind of contaminant.‚Äù But if there is something that feels beautiful and pleasant, my mind says, ‚ÄúOh, you seem to be approaching something true!‚Äù And then my mind goes in that direction.

It functions automatically, and I always have good time. I just connect truth with joy and untruth with a lower level of functioning. Highest joy is highest truth. There is no separation.

It is important to have a feeling of surplus. If you have that, you will generally do good things. If your motivation is right, you don‚Äôt have to check every word. Every action will be well-rounded and benefit others. But if you have a sour feeling, for example, then even if you watch every word you say, you will still make mistakes. People will get mad at you because they‚Äôll feel your vibration and reflect it back to you.

So it‚Äôs better to develop the ability to see things on the highest possible level. If you can do that, you will automatically become compassionate, loving, and beyond-personal, and you will do nothing wrong.

So, the closer to the head you catch the snake, the less it will be able to disturb you. Just try to go into the world with a good feeling. Make sure you are doing well, and wish everybody something good. If you then do, think, or say anything harmful, five red warning lights will flash up at once.

Of course, one cannot grasp at holding the highest view the same way one cannot grasp at meditation. On the outer level, we can avoid doing things that will certainly pull us down. On the inner level, we should also make sure that compassion and wisdom are present, and on the highest level we maintain the view. But actually, the experience of the highest view appears spontaneously and effortlessly by itself; one cannot force it.

You can only make sure that you always identify more truth with more joy. And this way you can develop a very fine inner sense for knowing whether you are moving away from or getting closer to your inner light, whether you are doing something honest and well-rounded or are becoming a bit distant and unclear.

The mind develops many subtle bells and red lights that help one be aware in everything that happens.",Buddhism,1655164610.0,t3_vbq40x,0.5,0

The middle path of traditional vs non,"Buddhism can be frustrating.  


Speaking only for myself, Buddhism is about liberation of all beings from suffering.    
There is no point in thinking of liberating myself, as there is no self, everything is everything else.   


So reading posts about sect related issues, cosmology, concepts, just frustrates me.  
Its not that I dont believe in these things, attempting to be secular, its that these things dont take priority to me over the primary point which is liberating all beings from suffering.   


Why would I get caught up in the temporal matters of people and their standing in a tradition, or what age I am in, when none of these are things I can control, and none of these feel as if they really have anything to do with ending suffering for all beings.   Maybe I just dont get it.   Thats ok, Id rather know I wasnt getting it.  


  
Im ok with the idea of nearly anything, as ideas can evolve, they can expand, they can grow, or shrink, they can change.  Beliefs are rigid.   I believe there was a Buddha, I believe he attained enlightenment, I believe in his teachings and in the Sangha.   I seek to keep the rigidity that may come from that at a minimum less I start holding a bag of sand, thinking it was my dead son, when all the while my dead son was right there, alive, all along.  I am open to the ideas of everything else, and not closed off against them.   However on the other end, I would find believing in them to a point of elimination of other ideas to be missing the point.

A personal theory about the nature of samsara.,"Imagine a source of light, such as a sun, appearing in an endless dead void.

As the light spreads through the void, any region it reaches is first enlightened just a tiny bit. Gradually, more light seeps in. The region grows increasingly luminous, until eventually, there's no difference between it and the center of the light source. It has, in fact, become a new part of the original light source. The process continues in the same way, in regions beyond the one we just examined. The process as a whole can be described simply as the original light source **growing**.

Now consider the light source as Nibbana, the ultimate, infinite **freedom**. As it grows, it first creates regions with a tiny degree of freedom: **inanimate matter**. Which only has the freedom to take up space.

As more light seeps in, forms with greater degree of freedom are created: **living forms**.

Initially these are merely plants, which have very limited freedom, for example to grow and shape themselves.

Eventually animals will emerge. Animals have more freedom than plants, and as they evolve from simple single-cell organism, to more sophisticated complex organisms composed of numerous cells and organs, their degree of freedom grows.

They acquire growing levels of consciousness, and increasingly approach **contemplative consciousness**, which we have as humans and is a quantum leap in freedom, though in some ways a double-edged sword.

At some basic level, every thing which exists is endowed with a **tendency to exist**. In inanimate matter, this is manifest in how matter will remain the same - not change or move at all - unless forced to by some external force. Plants clearly struggle to survive, just consider the sapling or even blade of grass twisting itself towards the light necessary for its survival.

For every living thing, the desire to exist is clearly a fundamental quality. As the life form evolves, this desire is buttressed by instincts that grow ever more sophisticated, until they mature into **consciousness**, which in a sense is the ultimate survival instinct. The animal is now able to reflect about its own survival, and thus secure it far more effectively, notably by responding to external (desirable) opportunities and (undesirable) threats.

The drive to survive becomes increasingly more conscious and deliberate, until it ripens fully into **contemplative consciousness**, which allowed us humans to build weapons and forts and granaries and take over the planet. However, contemplative consciousness can direct itself freely towards any object, including - reflectively - **its own self**, its own nature and the very nature of existence (which is of course a purely mental phenomena - we are not aware of anything outside our consciousness, including its sense impressions and thoughts. Literally nothing else exists for us, and existence itself is consciousness.)

This level of consciousness is the ultimate goal of the process because **such consciousness can contemplate and ultimate realize its own true nature**. This teaching is not exclusive to Buddhism or even all of Eastern philosophy: The maxim ""know thyself"" was carved into the gate of the Temple of Apollo - God of reason - in Delphi, and later made a cornerstone of Western philosophy by Socrates and Plato.

Indeed, this knowledge isn't so much **learning of the new**, but **a return** to the source of infinite knowledge. With enlightenment, consciousness is able to **come back to its source**, the great light whence its own light came: Nibbana. For example, Socrates taught there is no such thing as ""learning something new"", only **remembering that which is already there but obscured by ignorance**. It's all there, just obscured by the veil of avijjƒÅ. Sounds familiar?

What I like about this theory is that it elegantly answers a question that bothered me for a while: **the nature of the defilements**.

According to this theory, the defilements are not some external pollution, but just **a primitive state of enlightenment**. The defiled state is merely **a state of transition between absent and absolute freedom**. It's a spectrum stretching from complete ignorance (absence of life) to full knowledge, realization, and freedom.

Contemplative consciousness, and its functional product - free will - allow us to reverberate any sensation by reflecting upon it.

As stated before, this is a double edged sword.

We can choose to reflect, and thus multiply, upon our own survival instincts. That is an extremely popular topic of contemplation, given how prominent these instincts are for us, descendants of animals, and can be seen as quite natural given how consciousness itself can be seen as a product of these survival instincts and a sophisticated tool for survival.

Contemplating upon our survival instincts multiplies them ad-infinitum, such that simple animal instincts for food and safety are multiplied into greed, and greed becomes infinite - an infinite hunger, first for sensual stimulation, but later, when the capacity of our senses to take in more stimulation is exhausted, we **abstract our desires** into purely symbolic forms: hunger for infinite amounts of power, money, ""fame"", etc.

This is how karma is created.

This self-reflecting, self-reverberating process can amplify every sensation. That is why humans can suffer so much more than animals, let alone plants or inanimate objects.

An animal will always be struck by the single arrow alone. A human, contemplating this strike, will reverberate it, striking his own self with the second, third, fourth, any number of arrows of repeated conscious thought.

The most evolved humans, with the greatest level of consciousness, are thus those with the greatest capacity to inflict suffering upon themselves.

This whole process of conscious, deliberate contemplation is the root of karma, and I expect that animals cannot create karma, or only minimally, due to their nearly absent level of consciousness.

This is the capacity of the beings with contemplative consciousness: to **ill-use it to amplify their own attachments**. The principal attachment to existence, which Buddhism calls ta·πáhƒÅ, and its two subsidiaries: desire for states that appear to aid and enhance survival (lobha), aversion for states that seem to hinder and diminish survival (dosa). These are both accompanied by the necessary factor that will makes attachment to existence itself seem crucial: the obscuration of the light source whence consciousness originated, or in Buddhist terms **its own true nature**. Or in Pali, moha.

So far about the capacity of contemplative consciousness to amplify its base instincts and create karma. But it can also be directed towards itself, and if done correctly, realize its own true nature.

In this process, it will realize that **the self is nothing more than a powerful, involved, and sophisticated complex of survival instincts**.

The ultimate achievement possible for consciousness can be attained with correct direction at contemplating its own self, raising doubt at its instinctual representation of the world (name and form, nama rupa) as a symbolic battleground of desire and aversion, where the goal is survival and existence. Exposing delusions such as the possibility of physical forms persisting forever, without change or death - the ultimate survival fantasy, the delusion to satisfy all our primitive instinctual drives to survive. Or another delusion, that if only we attain our next goal - that next promotion, sexual conquest, house, car, extra figure in our bank balance - we will abide in eternal bliss in this very life. Of course, our instincts will never relent in their battle to survive and multiply, our happiness is not their goal, and reaching any milestone will only allow them to pull us pitilessly towards the next, until we exhaust our survival and procreation potential and our body breaks apart.

(There are associated delusions, mostly symbolic. For example, most people delude themselves that they can continue ""living"" through their children, legacy, people who remember them, etc - thus the fear of ""being forgotten"", and all our weird rituals around death and commemorating the dead.)

By realizing our true nature, our inseparable union with the great light source - Nibbana - we can abandon the primitive halfway state of existence. As we progress towards this realization, it is as if our bodies become more illuminated. Eventually, there is only the light, and physical existence is abandoned.

This can also be conceptualized as a gradual process of **refining one substance to another**. For example, refining crude oil into gasoline. Initially there is just crude oil (or more accurately, there is nothing). Then there's 1%, 2%, 3% gasoline (or more luminous). Increasingly, the partially refined substance exhibits less qualities of the crude oil (dumb, compulsive attachment) and more qualities of the gasoline (infinite freedom). Eventually, there is only gasoline (or pure light without darkness, or the opposite of nothing: everything).

The defiled state is just a half-state somewhere between these two extremes.

I very much welcome comments. To give some context, this theory was born out of intense contemplation of a question that always bothered me: why are there defilements?

"My Selfish Buddhism, in which liberation is self-serving, and compassion is a defilement","For as a long as I can remember, I wanted to be unconditionally free.

Even as a five years old, I sought to get away from other people, and spent  every possible moment by myself. I didn't want to get involved or attached to anyone.

This liberation I view as **self-serving**: I want to be **personally** free of suffering or coercion.

I view compassion / caring as a trap that *causes* or *is* attachment - effectively, a defilement. I generally elect to detach from other people rather than get involved or care about them.

For the longest time I refused to date. When I eventually did, it felt like giving into my weaknesses, and for the most part, I didn't actually care about the girls I dated. I just had _desires_ for them, and an _attachment_ to them, both of which I viewed as **problems**, and was always striving to eradicate.

They had desires and attachments to me, of course, but they also had compassion and caring mixed into them, while I generally didn't. I am starting to realize that mixing compassion into desire may redeem it, to an extent.

My view of Buddhism, you would see as distorted. I admire the Buddha for being **strong**, perfectly free, in complete mastery of himself, needing nothing nor nobody. All the teachings about compassion, I see them as bizarre misguided bullshit, antithetical to Buddhism's core mission of liberation, and perhaps propaganda the Buddha was required to preach by the powers that be, or was introduced later by translators shocked and horrified at what True Buddhism is: an instrument for an individual to free himself from all bondage, including the many barbed yokes of society and the hypocritical, interested requirement that he should sacrifice himself for others.

My [first ever post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/5xju8h/the_first_3_noble_truths_make_perfect_sense_to_me/) mentioned that:

> For example, why should we strive for compassion (Right Resolve)?
> 
> Once you've eradicated your tanha (attachment), then by the airtight logic of the first 3 truths, you are no longer subject to dukkha (suffering). Why is it necessary - or even desirable - for you to feel compassion towards other beings?

I believe that we are all Gods/Buddhas, and should treat each other with the same level of respect and decency we admit to ourselves. That this is a facet of Being which should be uncompromising, and that we are here to enlighten others.

If that transformation isn't conducted with a steady, unfailing concentration on The Dharma... the individual is doomed.

I am surprised at how much attention Buddhism gets in the atheist community.,"I'm surprised, as well. There really isn't much overlap in the two other than the lack of teaching in a God. Buddhism is structured like many other religions: meditation centers vs. temple/church, Dalai Lama vs. pope, Pali Canon & sutras vs bible/koran. Also, being a good Buddhist and being a good Christian, for example, are not conflicting ideas.
     
Going back to the lack of teachings in God, it is quite common for Buddhists to believe in God. The reason that it's not taught is because God is an identity that can't be spoken and must be understood through experience. There are many Buddhism books today that mention some form of Heaven, God, or True Man. The book I'm reading of Chuang Tzu mentions all three of those. It mainly covers stories of Confucius, but links every story to a meditation.
     
In conclusion, I find it disheartening for others here when things are posted here that are so blatantly atheistic. You can't just tell other people that there is no God. This is the same error that anyone else makes when they evangelize through speech and not experience. Lastly, there is as much evidence against God as there is for God; it may not be a big man in the sky intent on dealing punishment and heaven may not be pearly gates on white clouds, but God's very identity is by nature un-provable.

"Met someone from a past life, now I'm not sure what to do (LONG POST)","SO last year I left LA to work on a set in Mexico as a translator for the DP. I had known getting there that I would be living there for 5 months. I was single, and willing to create a fling with someone while out there. After a few weeks of working together, we began to hang out on set during any downtime, and that soon led to us hanging out in my hotel room. 
The night he first came over my heart was pounding so hard I felt like it would burst from my chest. I only found it odd since I couldn't find a reason to feel nervous. I wasn't attached to him, I barley knew him.  
That night in the middle of sex  I experienced  a strange flash back. It threw me out of the mind state of having sex, and nearly killed the mood for me. 
I didn't make anything of it right away passing, it off as some random vision that didn't have anything to do with him. 
After a month of constantly seeing each other, whether on or off set, we realized how attached, and how addicted we became to one another. One night, I told him about the flashback from our first  night together, and he confirms that he saw it too. That he also felt that feeling of knowing me. 

Now I know I am in love. We are not together. I (22F) moved back to LA, and he (34M) stayed in Mexico. We left the title to our relationship as friends. But since I've been back I have felt myself gravitate to him, as if he was a magnet. 
I don't know if it is because i am in love, or because I don't want to let someone from another lifetime go, or am i in love with him because he is from my other lifetime?

How do Buddhists view pharmaceutical drugs and psychiatry?,"I often wonder how traditional Buddhists view professions in medicine and pharmacy, especially anything involving psychiatric treatments. Are they viewed as noble professions? Or are these people simply propagating a harmful approach to dealing with the mind? And what about the patients? Are they making a mistake by resorting to pharmaceuticals to treat mental issues?

For example, how do traditional Buddhists view things like:

‚Ä¢ People with ADHD diagnoses using powerful stimulants to improve concentration and motivation, sometimes for their entire lives

‚Ä¢ Anxious and depressed people taking things like antidepressants and benzodiazepines (‚Äúalcohol in a pill‚Äù)

‚Ä¢ Opioid addicts relying on medication-assisted treatment (usually other opioids) to live stable lives

‚Ä¢ Psychotic people taking anti-psychotics

Do Buddhists have any opinion on these things? Is the use of these drugs viewed as ‚Äúcheating‚Äù through life? Or is it all okay because it‚Äôs legal and prescribed?",Buddhism,1703532563.0,t3_18qp8en,0.55,3
I do not take refuge in the sangha,"Hasn't anyone else felt like there is no 'Sangha'? At least where I live, there is no local Buddhist community so it is not easy to find a teacher or an otherwise respected individual to learn from. It seems like every distinct modern Buddhist author has been involved in some kind of sex scandal- late in their lives, which makes me wonder if all that practice even helped them at all? The exceptions I can think of are Bikkhu Bodhi afaik, TNH who I am not particularly familiar with and Eknath Easwaran who I am also not very familiar with and is not exactly Buddhist. Others stray wildly from early Buddhist doctrine which is fine but does not resonate with me therefore not my bag, and the rest are people like Daniel Ingram (delusional). Modern monastics I've physically been in contact with are very unserious and fixated on ritual and tradition while behaving in contrast with what is described in the Nikayas... Such as playing video games, having money and cell phones, listening to music and watching tv ect, being fat from eating junk food etc. I don't understand devoting yourself to a way of life and not really devoting yourself to it? And the very serious outliers also do not seem to have acquired a lot of 'path knowledge' or whatever you'd say, their dhamma talks don't mean anything, they seem to be missing the point, I don't know what they're doing with their time, but maybe they are just poor communicators. I don't know, but why give Dhamma talks then? And it goes without saying that online communities are full of people who are Buddhist in name only and otherwise very unpleasant. 

&#x200B;

Obviously I am biased because this is my perception as an outsider but this has been a very sore point for me. Whenever I see any mention of the Sangha or the triple jewel I am disappointed. I am sure somebody relates to this. Another thing is, if you are very serious and want to 'go forth' as a woman in my part of the world you are on your own unless you've previously paid to go to some expensive Buddhist retreat in which case maybe you'll get into a community of seriously indoctrinated westerners larping as Thai monks who are vastly overestimating their 'attainments'. Overall it seems like a toxic and delusional community.

Suicide and Reincarnation,"If a person chooses suicide to end their suffering, Buddhism says it‚Äôs more or less pointless because your karma will carry over and cause suffering in your next reincarnation‚Ä¶

Cash Rules Everything Around Me,"(EDIT: sorry for the Wu-Tang reference, I don't mean aby disrespect.)

I'm currently thinking a lot about money. Not because I want to get rich and live in luxury, but because multiple people depend on my income.

I am grateful that I can support them financially and I also try to save some money in order to support them when their needs grow bigger due to old age or when unexpected bills have to be paid.

However, this situation is also causing me a lot of stress. I am afraid of getting so sick that I can no longer earn enough to support them. If I die in the near future, my savings will not be enough for them and not even my partner will get any type of substantial assistance because we are not married.

I feel like I have to constantly do my best in order to fulfill my obligation to them, including marrying my partner for tax reasons and for the payments they will receive when I die.

I'm well aware that I am very privileged right now. That justs adds more to the burden because I feel I need to make the most out of my privilege.

At best, gender is an act the ego performs. Sex (male / female/ intersex) is a result of our form (rupa) but it is not our self.

Why does Buddhism conflate the self and the soul?,"According to most interpretations I've seen of Anatta, there is no self in the sense of an unchanging eternal ""I"".

And therefore, at least according to most interpretations I've seen, there's no soul or atman.

But I find that there seems to be a leap in logic here; from the lack of a permanent unchanging self, to a negation of the existence of a soul.

I don't follow the logic. A theoretical soul, or permanent and unchanging essence is not, definitionally, the same as a permanent and unchanging sense or perception of self. But many Buddhists seem to take that view.

In other words, the soul and the self aren't inherently the same thing, but many Buddhists seem to define the two concepts as the same thing, and then deny them together.

"meditation as a tool, not a means","&#x200B;

This is a very abridged explanation of my thoughts on meditation. I have often relayed it to the many people who ask me about the importance of a meditative practices with regards to spiritual development.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Meditation is simply a tool, while in practice, there is innumerable ways one can do it. However, if done properly they will achieve the same goal. When talking about the mind I tend to borrow one metaphor from Sat Guru, a well-known/well-spoken Indian mystic, and who often compares the mind/intellect to a knife. Meditation, in my opinion, is the most effective method for ""sharpening your mind"", but it is only half of the solution to suffering described by the Buddha, at least that's what I believe. Many westerners are acquainted with some meditation practice, regardless of religious affiliations. Modern society is full of various things that trigger stress in people, and so we have sought to reduce it by a variety of means. For some it may be working out, riding a bike, jogging, needlework, or meditation of course. According to those schools of Buddhism based on the principles of non-duality, anything that allows you to get in the zone, so long as the point of focus is singular, can satisfy the only real requirement to be called meditative. Those schools based on the principles of duality allow for the point of focus to be singular or multiple in nature.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Getting back on topic.... Meditation being only half of the solution then what, when combined with meditation, can be considered whole or as I like to call it wholesome? The simple answer is whatever might allow you to expand the capacity of your heart, empathic compassion/loving kindness. One must train the mind and the heart in tandem, and I'm convinced the historical Buddha taught as much, hence the importance of a ""middle path"". First, I‚Äôll explain one method, although there are countless ways, of training of the mind and the heart. Afterwards I‚Äôll try to explain my thoughts regarding the potential risk, only one exist but it's rather catastrophic, should one advance to far in either one ‚Äúthe mind/the heart‚Äù while neglecting the other.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Single pointed meditation is only one of many ways to train the mind, thus sharpening the intellect ""knife"". Now the intellect, once sharpened, possesses the ability to sever one's attachments and when severing stronger attachments, the intellect need be proportionally keen. Many understand that there is a potential risk when wielding a sharp knife yet, so few understand the potential risk of wielding a sharp intellect and furthermore, unlike the knife the intellect is double edged. How easy it is, with a keen mind but a small heart, to sever any attachments that cause only one's own ego/self to experience suffering, regardless/ignorant of how it may affect others. How hard it is, when the mind is keen and heart is large, to sever any attachments that cause only one's own ego/self to experience suffering, aware of how severing it will cause others to suffer on account of your actions. My rational for this risk is simple and relates to the necessity for parental consent that the buddha placed on anyone who wanted to become a monk.  A monk is one who aspires to achieve enlightenment. As such, the first step towards monkhood, the action of joining the sangha, must be a wholly positive good deed. Anyone who left without consent of their parents to become a monk would effectively be planting their seed, the intent to become a monk, in barren soil. Such a start would be self-obstructive at the worst and unproductive at best, and not in keeping with the very thing sought by monks to begin with, enlightenment.

&#x200B;

A duality centric loving kindness meditation is one of many ways to train the heart, thus increasing one‚Äôs capacity for empathy. As empathic beings, having enlarged our hearts capacity, we possess compassionate hearts fully able to empathize with the suffering experienced by others and the more interdependent/contrived their suffering is, the heart need be proportionally deep. Many understand that there is a potential risk in having a bleeding-heart, sympathy based, yet so few understand the potential risk in having a feeling-heart, empathy based, and furthermore, unlike the bleeding-heart a feeling-heart is double edged. How easy it is, with a heart‚Äôs capacity enlarged but a dull mind, to get overburdened/crushed as you attempt to help relieve the suffering of others, you take part of their suffering and make it you‚Äôre suffering. You will eventually lose sight of/forget what your burden, the cause of your own suffering, was to begin with. How hard it is, When the mind is keen and the heart is having a deep capacity, to get overburdened/crushed as you attempt to help relieve the suffering of others. You first sought  to become unburdened without burdening another, only then did you attempt to relieve others of their own suffering. Because of this unburdened position any subsequent actions, like taking part of others suffering and making it you‚Äôre suffering,  may be understood as unconditioned/without cause. Just like a lotus rooted in muck breaks free to bloom above the muddied waters, only those unconditioned acts that occur without cause, without cause should be understood to be cause itself here, and whose effect produces a fruit favorable to enlightenment. My rational for this risk is not simple and relates to my own understanding of the Buddha‚Äôs teachings.

&#x200B;

Simply put, while attempting to find relief a heartless mind will easily burdens others, knowingly or unknowingly. Such a heartless practices may relieve stress in this lifetime, but  is likely to have a negative impact, resulting in an even greater burden during your lifetime .    On the other hand, while great is the reward for one who is sincere and heartfelt while helping to relieve others, mindless one must not be. Just as there is no harvest for the farmer who waters another‚Äôs crop, and not his own, likewise there is no virtue in aiding others with their duties if your own duties go neglected.",Buddhism,1629721751.0,t3_p9ytjh,0.47,0

Just thought I'd copy paste this here.

""Those objects that we desire so much will lose their appeal over time. Sense pleasures, sexual or otherwise, are short-lived. Even if one can have access to sense pleasures, the ABILITY to enjoy them¬† WILL decrease with time. That is something that people typically do not realize""

""The attitude of most people is, ‚ÄúI need to enjoy them to the fullest while I can.‚Äù But one needs to stay away from extreme behaviors at least. Learning Dhamma will help to avoid **future suffering; one must start as soon as possible**. When we get old, we lose not only the ability to enjoy such pleasures but also the ability to comprehend Dhamma (because our brains degrade with time)""

You're not '(pure) awareness',"I've seen this idea floated around in Buddhist circles before.

The following premises I want to share are simple. I would love to be refuted, just like the rest of us.

Step away from the body and all of its sensations and perceptions. All you are left with is mind.

Step away from the mind and all of its forms (thoughts and emotions). What are you left with?

Here a lot of people naively make the mistake (as I did many times in the past) of thinking 'pure, non-judgmental/preferential awareness!'.

Here's why that's wrong. Your awareness can not exist in a vacuum (your mind is a mirror as zen folks say). You're only ever aware **of** things. Aware **of** things through your **senses** (and cognition).

Shed your senses. Shed your cognition. Nothing remains to be aware **of**, nothing remains to be aware **with**.

Forget no-self, all that's left is no-being. Gives a whole new perspective on the Buddhist idea of emptiness.

It is a Mahayana Sutra.

>Candapradyota: O brahmin, if there should happen to be a war, how does a perfectly righteous ruler deal with it?  
Satyavadin: Your majesty, he should deal with it by applying three types of skillful means during each one of the three different periods. These three periods are the beginning, middle, and end.  
At the beginning, if a ruler or minister can act as a friendly mediator and settle a dispute, a ruler should apply skillful means and thereby prevent war. If a ruler can placate his opponents and settle a dispute, he should do so and thereby prevent war. If a ruler can show that he has formed an alliance and has threatened the enemy with many more opponents, and in this way can succeed in preventing war, then he should form such an alliance, make threats, and thereby prevent war. In such ways a ruler should apply skillful means at the beginning. If a righteous ruler can not succeed in preventing war, whether by means of friendly mediation, benefitting his enemy, or issuing warnings, then he should wage war, keeping three thoughts in mind.  
Candapradyota: What are these three? As a righteous ruler, do I not cause people to fall into deplorable conditions and do I not neglect the method stopping people from falling into deplorable conditions?  
Satyavadin: First, a ruler must keep protection of the people in mind; second, a ruler must keep victory over the enemy in mind; amd third, a ruler must keep protection of all life in mind. Having these three thoughts in mind, a ruler then can summon the four corps of his armed forces. A ruler should apply skillful means in this way during the middle.  
During the final time, a ruler should arrange the four corps according to inferior, medium-grade, and superior soldiers. Inferior warriors should be arranged at the front line with medium-grade warriors behind them, and the calvary should extend behind these two. The ruler along with the superior warriors should remain at the rear. This arrangement will fulfill the ruler‚Äôs intention, bring good results, and allow the brave together with the cowardly soldiers to show gratitude, using whatever abilities they have, to fight with courage and also to fight fear; thus they will not be turned back. A ruler should apply his skillful means in this way during the final period.  
Although in war, injury and death may be inflicted on the opposing army, a ruler by his skillful means will commit less unspeakable and less nonvirtuous action and may not necessarily experience retribution, since he undertook such measures with heedfulness and compassion.  
Because he undertakes these measures for the protection of the people and for the sake of their families, wives, and children without concern for himself or his property and possessions, he greatly will increase his immeasurable merit. Your Majesty, if there is to be war, then a righteous ruler should consider it in this way.",Buddhism,1550820033.0,t3_atekdt,0.46,0

There is no failure or successes because its all based on the egos perception. 

Love wraps outside of the ego.

Compassion copes with outer beings.

Because these tread outside, they lead to liberation.

Liberating the self from the self. 

Or no self?

Is the only way no self?

What **is** no self?

Only way to find is meditation or psychedelics.

The controllers?

The ego.

From the person who's had it with the Hindi loan words... I've had it with the Obscurantists.,"I came across a great word the other day, ""obscurantist.""  It is a person who falls back on esoteric knowledge in order to appear smarter than the person they are challenging.  It is a powerful technique for small-minded people full of rote knowledge earned through tedious learning to overcome whoever it is they want to challenge.

Buddhism is full of Obscurantists.  They quote various esoteric sutras and claim that Buddha did or did not say one thing or another.  The greatest of all Obscurantists of course is the Pope and the Vatican he controls.  They employ a global army of professional Obscurantists -- priests -- who hold the final word on everything by reference to esoteric scripture.

The great strength of Buddhism is that deeply embedded in its teaching is a disdain for mere words, a refusal to be embodied by any particular text or saying.  It is first and foremost an experience that we are to have for ourselves, not knowledge and subservience to texts as a source of commands we ought follow.  Thus Buddhism is better able to resist the small-mindedness of Obscurantists better than the Judaic religions which fixed meaning within the text rather than fixing the text to point to meaning.

Reject Obscurantism.  Don't get pulled into debates over what Buddha did or didn't say, nobody really knows unless they were there.  Discern the principles and the Dharma, seek the experience of ego dissolution and nibbana, but don't get caught up in reading every sutra so you can win over the small-minded Obscurantists.",Buddhism,1341088914.0,t3_vurpe,0.47,0

Drop a bit the jargon from time to time,"Hey reddit, 

just posting an invitation to drop a bit some words that are particular to Buddhist translations and Buddhist original languages because it can be confusing for people new to Buddhism, and, if you say ""well, don't hold on emotionally to something"" and you say ""don't get attached to it"" it more or less conveys the same meaning, but one requires a deeper explanation and the other one is quite easy to understand and is less misleading. After saying something mundane you can complement it with something like ""this is called being detached"", for general knowledge's and further study's sake.


Try from time to time expressing things in your words (I would invite you to always try to use polite words, not aggressive), and try to do it in a concise speech, as short or as long as it's needed to be, no more no less. Altho, more often than not, some explanations get longer than needed. Some others get so short they can be misleading also.

Mind that other people don't have the responsibility to understand you. Nor you have the responsibility to make them understand... But let's just try to follow a centered path.

When becoming a teacher one stops saying his teacher's words and start talking it like it's your own knowledge (even tho it was from no one to begin with).

Also mind that what you are reading in most cases (with sutras and stuff) are translations, and some translators don't always find exact words to describe what's being translated, and sutras are no exception. So it might be better if you don't take words that seriously. Just enough to keep consistency and integrity.

The words don't make the teaching. The teaching makes the words.

If you don‚Äôt stroke fresh cow dung, stroke green grass. If you don‚Äôt stroke green grass, serve the sacred flame. If you don‚Äôt serve the sacred flame, revere the sun with joined palms. If you don‚Äôt revere the sun with joined palms, immerse yourself in water three times, including the evening.‚Äô The western brahmins advocate this kind of purity.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe purity advocated by the western brahmins is quite different from that in the training of the Noble One.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut what, Master Gotama, is purity in the training of the Noble One? Master Gotama, please teach me this.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell then, brahmin, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù Cunda replied. The Buddha said this:

‚ÄúCunda, impurity is threefold by way of body, fourfold by way of speech, and threefold by way of mind.

And how is impurity threefold by way of body? It‚Äôs when a certain person kills living creatures. They‚Äôre violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings. 

They steal. With the intention to commit theft, they take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness. 

They commit sexual misconduct. They have sexual relations with women who have their mother, father, both mother and father, brother, sister, relatives, or clan as guardian. They have sexual relations with a woman who is protected on principle, or who has a husband, or whose violation is punishable by law, or even one who has been garlanded as a token of betrothal. 

This is the threefold impurity by way of body.

And how is impurity fourfold by way of speech? It‚Äôs when a certain person lies. They‚Äôre summoned to a council, an assembly, a family meeting, a guild, or to the royal court, and asked to bear witness: ‚ÄòPlease, mister, say what you know.‚Äô Not knowing, they say ‚ÄòI know.‚Äô Knowing, they say ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know.‚Äô Not seeing, they say ‚ÄòI see.‚Äô And seeing, they say ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt see.‚Äô So they deliberately lie for the sake of themselves or another, or for some trivial worldly reason. 

They speak divisively. They repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. And so they divide those who are harmonious, supporting division, delighting in division, loving division, speaking words that promote division. 

They speak harshly. They use the kinds of words that are cruel, nasty, hurtful, offensive, bordering on anger, not leading to immersion. 

They talk nonsense. Their speech is untimely, and is neither factual nor beneficial. It has nothing to do with the teaching or the training. Their words have no value, and are untimely, unreasonable, rambling, and pointless. This is the fourfold impurity by way of speech. 

And how is impurity threefold by way of mind? It‚Äôs when a certain person is covetous. They covet the wealth and belongings of others: ‚ÄòOh, if only their belongings were mine!‚Äô 

They have ill will and malicious intentions: ‚ÄòMay these sentient beings be killed, slaughtered, slain, destroyed, or annihilated!‚Äô 

They have wrong view. Their perspective is distorted: ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There‚Äôs no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There‚Äôs no afterlife. There‚Äôs no such thing as mother and father, or beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there‚Äôs no ascetic or brahmin who is rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.‚Äô This is the threefold impurity by way of mind. 

These are the ten ways of doing unskillful deeds. When you have these ten ways of doing unskillful deeds, then if you rise early, whether or not you stroke the earth from your bed, you‚Äôre still impure.

Whether or not you stroke fresh cow dung, you‚Äôre still impure.

Whether or not you stroke green grass, you‚Äôre still impure.

Whether or not you serve the sacred flame, you‚Äôre still impure.

Whether or not you revere the sun with joined palms, you‚Äôre still impure.

Whether or not you immerse yourself in water three times, you‚Äôre still impure. Why is that? These ten ways of doing unskillful deeds are impure and make things impure.

It‚Äôs because of those who do these ten kinds of unskillful deeds that hell, the animal realm, the ghost realm, or any other bad places are found.

Cunda, purity is threefold by way of body, fourfold by way of speech, and threefold by way of mind.

And how is purity threefold by way of body? It‚Äôs when a certain person gives up killing living creatures. They renounce the rod and the sword. They‚Äôre scrupulous and kind, living full of compassion for all living beings. 

They give up stealing. They don‚Äôt, with the intention to commit theft, take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness. 

They give up sexual misconduct. They don‚Äôt have sexual relations with women who have their mother, father, both mother and father, brother, sister, relatives, or clan as guardian. They don‚Äôt have sexual relations with a woman who is protected on principle, or who has a husband, or whose violation is punishable by law, or even one who has been garlanded as a token of betrothal. 

This is the threefold purity by way of body.

And how is purity fourfold by way of speech? It‚Äôs when a certain person gives up lying. They‚Äôre summoned to a council, an assembly, a family meeting, a guild, or to the royal court, and asked to bear witness: ‚ÄòPlease, mister, say what you know.‚Äô Not knowing, they say ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know.‚Äô Knowing, they say ‚ÄòI know.‚Äô Not seeing, they say ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt see.‚Äô And seeing, they say ‚ÄòI see.‚Äô So they don‚Äôt deliberately lie for the sake of themselves or another, or for some trivial worldly reason. 

They give up divisive speech. They don‚Äôt repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, they reconcile those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony. 

They give up harsh speech. They speak in a way that‚Äôs mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable and agreeable to the people. 

They give up talking nonsense. Their words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. They say things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial. 

This is the fourfold purity by way of speech.

And how is purity threefold by way of mind? It‚Äôs when a certain person is content. They don‚Äôt covet the wealth and belongings of others: ‚ÄòOh, if only their belongings were mine!‚Äô 

They have a kind heart and loving intentions: ‚ÄòMay these sentient beings live free of enmity and ill will, untroubled and happy!‚Äô 

They have right view, an undistorted perspective: ‚ÄòThere is meaning in giving, sacrifice, and offerings. There are fruits and results of good and bad deeds. There is an afterlife. There are such things as mother and father, and beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there are ascetics and brahmins who are rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who describe the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.‚Äô 

This is the threefold purity by way of mind.

These are the ten ways of doing skillful deeds. When you have these ten ways of doing skillful deeds, then if you rise early, whether or not you stroke the earth from your bed, you‚Äôre still pure.

Whether or not you stroke fresh cow dung, you‚Äôre still pure.

Whether or not you stroke green grass, you‚Äôre still pure.

Whether or not you serve the sacred flame, you‚Äôre still pure.

Whether or not you revere the sun with joined palms, you‚Äôre still pure.

Whether or not you immerse yourself in water three times, you‚Äôre still pure. Why is that? These ten ways of doing skillful deeds are pure and make things pure.

It‚Äôs because of those who do these ten kinds of skillful deeds that gods, humans, or any other good places are found.‚Äù

When he said this, Cunda the smith said to the Buddha, ‚ÄúExcellent, sir! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what‚Äôs there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.‚Äù

"An Issue With Western ""Buddhism""","Or rather, with the practices of most Westerners.

&nbsp;

I've noticed a trend, or rather just started paying attention to a trend, of people wishing to be ""Buddhist"", without being Buddhist. That is, without all the ""woo woo"" and superstition/faith(Depending on your outlook/vocab).

&nbsp;

People asking, ""What's the point of karma and rebirth, if you can't prove it?"", or for Buddhist teachers/lineages that lack belief in the Six Realms, Nirvana, or Devas/Hungry ghosts. That would be equivalent to asking if there are any Christian denominations where they don't believe Christ is Lord, or Islam without respect to Muhammed(PBUH). You can't ""pick and choose"" Buddhism and the supernatural, like some Belief Buffet. If you're looking for a way to calm your mind without the supernatural, meditation is fine, but so is CBT. Wish to be a better person? Like Nike, just do it, you don't need Buddhism as some sort of ""exotic"" rationale for not being a dick.(Yes, I know ""Secular Buddhism"" is a thing, along with ""Secular Christianity."" I think that strips them both of their true meaning.)

&nbsp;

Long story short: It's fine to have doubts about your faith. Even the Buddha said not to believe him sight unseen, but to try and experience it for yourself. But pretending that Buddhism, stripped of it's faith and teachings of things supernatural, is still Buddhism, is flawed Incorrect Speech.

Is the soul doesn't exist how do past lives work?,"I'm new to this sub so go easy on me.

His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama according to Tibetan Buddhist teaching is the 14th reincarnation of the same being, retaining enough semblance of his past lives to recall his previous memories and confirm himself upon re-entry into this physical state as the next Dalai Lama in the succession.

If the Dalai Lama is a manifestation of the Buddha of Compassion ""choosing"" to reincarnate to assist humanity, what is ""choosing"" to come back if after Nirvana one is liberated from existence in all forms? If the ""soul"" does not exist and consciousness ceases after enlightenment what exactly is coming back?

Some tell me that achieving Nirvana means the end of the deluded state of self, like a flame going out. Consciousness ceases to exist. It is the end of samsara. This is the distinction from Hinduism that teaches a supreme reality, united consciousness. Others say that achieving Nirvana creates an unbinding from this conditioned reality, but a transition to a limitless consciousness outside the physical.

Ajahn Brahm has already been excommunicated because he ordained four women and refused the councils demand to openly dismiss the ordination of the Bhukkini.

Does Buddhism have a 'race problem' in your view? Why or why not?,"Just curious. I'm involved with a non-profit that started with COVID relief and is now moving into helping Black dharma teachers. They want to raise several million dollars to give $500 a month to support Black dharma teachers. Not against this, just stating the context of why I'm curious.

I've done some research of my own and found majority of the Buddhists in America live in California and Hawaii. A friend of mine who is very familiar with this issue tells me there are some Buddhist groups that only allow Black Buddhists and no one else, many times they have trouble gaining membership and staying afloat financially.

I grew up in Atlanta, so I am well aware of the racial tensions in America and have seen many of the underlying causes around me growing up. I have never seen anyone turned away from a Buddhist center though, regardless of color, gender, sexual orientation, or political views. The vibe in the centers I frequented was about moving beyond self-grasping to reach the Other Shore.

What I do see happening is politics is beginning to become a part of an institution that, to me, has aimed to be the end of religion, politics, business-as-usual. I see identity politics creating moral crusades that cause further division at a time when we could focus on unifying causes like regenerative agriculture (a solution for world health, climate change, sustainable development).

This is what I think at least. I could be misguided or misled, I'm only 31 after all. So, please speak freely because I'd love to hear from as many points of view as possible. I genuinely want to understand and if I can, be of service.

Even though it might be controversial, I thought this article was worth reading. It presents some reflections that could be considered nuanced on abortion, and also talks about ""mizuko kuyo"", a Japanese ceremony for ""abortion, miscarriage, stillbirth, or sudden infant death"".

The title of the article feels a bit misleading, or like click-bait or sensationalist, and I thought of not using it for the title of the post, but then I thought it might be more transparent to simply leave it as it is.

Dealing with Demonic Influences,"Edit: please read it all before downvoting or upvoting. This post is not as mystical as you think it is.

A demonic influence or state is considered to be so when we can't trace well the cause of our delusion or suffering to any particular cause; it's rooted in falseness and thus it's void and non-real, yet it affect us deeply.

Most demonic influence happen because of the following:

- Thinking falsely that you are enlightened, that you are a sage, or confusing a small achievement, vision, revelation, or a ""deep"" or impressive experience with full enlightenment.

- Being conceited and taking huge pride in one self and your capacities, ideas or actions, distancing yourself from others and seeing your achievements as unreachable by others; disregarding other's achievements and not recognising your own mistakes but seeing as huge other's mistakes.

- Feeling fear of demons, ghosts, darkness, spirits, monsters or any supernatural or natural beings or powers outside of our control. Fear of judgment, of making mistakes, of not being loved, of being lonely, of losing someone, etc. **Any kind of fear is in itself a demonic influence in every single case**, it is the most common and root demonic influence of them all. Under every single demonic influence there's a very well covered feeling of fear underneath.

- Indulging in unwholesome actions or thinking you are indulging in unwholesome actions and fearing retribution for them (wether we really did something bad or not).

- Indulging into duality and discursive thoughts excessively (she loves me she doesn't, I love him I hate him, I don't know if that was right or wrong, etc.) and going from one side of the coin to the other, and also thinking you are indulging into duality.

- Indulging into greed, lust or anger or thinking you are indulging into greed, lust or anger.

Demonic states are banished easily if the person recognises them as such, empty, non-existent, and not real phenomena. Just like a lie is a non-existent phenomena.

Demonic states completely rely on our mind to exist. If our mind stops feeding, they die on their own. Just like lies die if no one believes them. The same with nightmares and fears.

When our restlessness, emotional unbalance, emotional burst, unease, hardship or delusion can't be traced to anywhere in ourselves, our memories or our ideas with vipassana or with any other meditation; the most probable cause is that we are under demonic influence and like previously told, you need only to recognise such event as false, empty and non-existent for it to perish and be gone.

Fear is very elusive and tricky as all demonic states. We might feel fear of feeling fear for example. So we must be careful and smart. It takes experience to snap out of demonic influences and more to not get caught in the as they are very very subtle.

Fear of being conceited is also fear. Fear of indulging into unwholesome actions is also fear. Fear of fear is also fear. Etc. Thinking excessively of what is fear and what is not also brings a demonic influence.

If fear persists and you can't end it without just recognising it as void then you should meditate upon this: Your fear, your pain and you are all void. Void can't harm void. Emptiness can't harm emptiness. The pain is void, you are void.

I have a bone to pick with Buddhism.,"I fell into it during my formative years. At 14-15 years of age I read and agreed that wants cause suffering, about staying detached from everything - especially your own self, and everything else about passivity and escapism that Buddhism teaches. (To the Buddhist view this isn't escapism, this is growing inwards.) I actively curbed my wants and restricted my thoughts. Now I see the damage this worldview has caused me.


Buddhism works on people who indulged in their lives and at some point grew weary of it, or suffered an incident of loss and wanted to withdraw, or couldn't cope with the world in general. Such a mind seeks escape from reality, and to them, the concept of 'refuge' appeals like a garden of serenity to withdraw from the world. (I'm referring to the Earth, its constituents, and time as 'real'.)


It definitely does not work the other way: if your mind already shaped as a Buddhist to forego wants and rationalize passive suffering and is content with what's around you even though you may be burning in hell, you do not want to participate in the world anymore. You've already withdrawn, and it's turned your mind into a ghost. You're in self doubt because ego is vanity and loving yourself is selfish and vain. Then you suffer a catatonic state of having nothing to do, nowhere to go, nothing to achieve or work towards. You're never able to experience happiness because someone said, all happiness is fleeting, and all pursuit of it futile. You've already died, just that the body will continue to live on for another fifty years. Enjoy!


People my age are doing it all, the full experience. And I don't want to deep down, there's no desire, and there's no sense of self actualization, everything is suffering. Until recently, I was thinking it was them in the wrong for believing that that is happiness. How braindead have I become.


I'm not blaming anything. I'm not looking to understand my thoughts anymore. It's only that I now feel out of place in the world, and I think I made a connection why. I think I wired the wrong ideology into my brain, missed out on growing a lot as a 'real person' by developing the wrong perspective, and I'm in incredible psychological pain and confusion. I now need refuge from myself. (By 'real' I still mean belonging to the physical world, not some metaphysical ideal that exists in the _spirit within_.)


I don't intend to offend, but I'll raise that Buddhism teaches surrender, passivity, giving up, withdrawal, denial and escapism from physical reality and can have very damaging consequences on the individual's experience with life. It's accepting the hell around you and taking the easy way out.

"How the movie ""Sausage Party"" reveals the nature of reality and the path to enlightenment.","**Warning: Spoilers ahead.

Also, some concepts of this post will not be directly related to Buddhism. I will be using the term ""Archons"", however perhaps there is a better Buddhist term, maybe demons.** 


Sausage Party is about a the lives of food in a supermarket. They all are happy because they have an idea about their world and the afterlife. They see humans as gods that hold their fate, and carry them beyond the doors where they believe heaven awaits them. One of them ends up being returned and is full of fear because he realized that the afterlife is actually not as he thought it was. He tries to speak out but is seen as crazy.


Another thing to mention is the relationship these characters have with each other. Many of them dislike each other, upset that they share the same aisles, Sauerkraut wishing to exterminate Juice, etc.


Because of their delusions about heaven (or life after death), many of them believe they should act a certain way and avoid certain acts like homosexuality and sex because the gods are always watching.


At one point some of the produce are bought and they are awaiting heaven and realize the gods are actually evil entities that use them for energy. In the movie it even says how they eat children, how their hunger is insatiable, and that the people created them for their own benefit.


*This is an extremely accurate portrayal of what Archons do. They are entities that control our reality and feed off our energy and fear for their own insatiable appetites. At the time of death, they await at the light to coax us in, claiming it is the entrance into heaven, but it is actually a trick to make us come back to this reality so they can continue using us and feed on our energy.*


In the movie, when the characters are faced with the truth, they first deny it. They would rather rest in their happy ideas about the world even though it doesn't face or fix the problem.


**This idea represents the first characteristic of our reality, that suffering exists because we are pretty much completely off the radar on what reality is. Many people aren't willing to take this first step because it conflicts with everything they've ever known and been comforted by.**


It only took a few minutes from this point of denial before the produce were faced with the tough truth by seeing it for themselves. They felt hopeless, but quickly realized if they work together they can defeat the ""gods"".


*This is exactly what the cabal, or so called ""gods"" of our reality don't want us to realize, that if we saw how the problems we attach to one another are unimportant and false, that we might wake up to see who the real enemies are, them! Together, we have enough energy to defeat them.*


After the produce defeats the ""gods"", they have the supermarket to themselves, and humorously partake in a superfluous amount of pleasurable acts with each other, seeing that heaven, or enlightenment, was there the whole time.


**The second characteristic of reality this movie represents is also quite clear at this point if you look for it, though they never specifically mention it... impermanence. We are dealing with a movie about produce. Even when they come to understand the reality of the gods, they have not yet faced their own mortality. They believe they've reached enlightenment at this point, partaking in pleasure and happiness but have not yet faced the nature of their existence. Humans face the same issue, since we are expiring every day and don't often check in with this or practice accepting death, we may live a very happy life but be faced with fear when it is time to leave it. With every ounce of our being wanting to come back to existence, we are more than compliant to enter the light. Archons will also show images of loved ones and use our emotional attachments to people to make us return.**


But of course that's not the end, there is a plot twist, much like in our reality, there is more to the story. After tripping, some of the characters realize that all of existence is an illusion, how they are all characters in a movie actually created by even grander beings in another dimension (Collective Consciousness). They realize that their voices, ideas, opinions, etc. are all part of something beyond themselves. They create a machine that will take them out of the illusion, holding hands as they walk in to the wormhole together. As they do this, the screen warps in on itself and that is the end of the movie.


**This idea represents the other two aspects of our reality, emptiness and non-self. Emptiness because nothing in our reality has a purpose, it just is. We are comprised of molecules and we choose to give it meaning, but if we truly look, we can see that it simply doesn't exist, at least not in the way we perceive it in our day to day lives. Non-self is represented here because the produce become aware of the fact that the choices they make and even their voices aren't ""them"". It is some higher consciousness working together that brings them their life and experience.**


*In the end, they are willing and fearless about their fates as they enter the wormhole. They see how beautiful life is just being life and experiencing it. That is ultimately what enlightenment is and what every being wishes to find.*",Buddhism,1494042345.0,t3_69j9a9,0.59,5

For the sake of clarity I will define Enlightenment here; it is completely overcoming duality, or the sense of being separate from experience. Thus enlightenment is the experience of union with what different tradition have described as the nature of reality, or God, or emptiness, or so on.  It is fully being right in the present with absolutely no question to the contrary.

"Some of your ancestors and deceased loved ones may have been reborn as hungry ghosts, no longer able to fend for themselves. In this poem the Buddha explains that it is to your long-term benefit ‚Äî and to theirs ‚Äî that you honor their memory with gifts.","    Outside the walls they stand,
	    & at crossroads.
    At door posts they stand,
 	    returning to their old homes.
    But when a meal with plentiful food & drink is served,
	    no one remembers them:
    Such is the kamma of living beings.

    Thus those who feel sympathy for their dead relatives
    give timely donations of proper food & drink
	    ‚Äî exquisite, clean ‚Äî
    [thinking:] ""May this be for our relatives.
		    May our relatives be happy!""

    And those who have gathered there,
	    the assembled shades of the relatives,
    with appreciation give their blessing
    for the plentiful food & drink:
	    ""May our relatives live long
	    because of whom we have gained [this gift].
	    We have been honored,
	    and the donors are not without reward!""

    For there [in their realm] there's
	    no farming,
	    no herding of cattle,
	    no commerce,
	    no trading with money.
    They live on what is given here,
	    hungry shades
	    whose time here is done.

    As water raining on a hill
    flows down to the valley,
	    even so does what is given here
	    benefit the dead.
    As rivers full of water
    fill the ocean full,
	    even so does what is given here
	    benefit the dead.

    ""He gave to me, she acted on my behalf,
	    they were my relatives, companions, friends"":
    Offerings should be given for the dead
    when one reflects thus
    on things done in the past.
    For no weeping,
	    no sorrowing
	    no other lamentation
		    benefits the dead
		    whose relatives persist in that way.
    But when this offering is given, well-placed in the Sangha,
    it works for their long-term benefit
    and they profit immediately.

    In this way 
		    the proper duty to relatives has been shown,
		    great honor has been done to the dead,
		    and monks have been given strength:

	    The merit you've acquired
		    isn't small.

Why are humans so special?,"So much of Buddhism does seem to elevate humanity above the other animals and states of existence. It seems to me that we have a lot of territorial genetic baggage, as well as the ever growing heap of society's baggage, and a very counter-intuitive reptilian brain at the basis of our genetic upbringing. What about the other animals that might evolve intelligence in the next 100,000 years? What if they have less territorial hangups? Are they still somehow not good enough to make the cut? Dogs seem to encapsulate mindfulness, compassion, and being in the moment, and get over emotional baggage much more readily. Why aren't there dog buddhas? Is it because we can't understand their words? Isn't that hanging too much attachment on words, which we typically agree, severely limit our ability to communicate, and pedantics can take our words and ignore our meaning?

On what rational basis can one believe in Amitabha?,"There is a rational argument to be made for the salvific power of Jesus' death on the cross, which goes roughly as follows:

1. The Gospels are basically accurate historical documents. 
2. Therefore, there is good historical evidence that Jesus died on the cross and afterward appeared  and spoke to to his disciples. 
3. The best logical explanation for this is that God raised him from the dead, and he was who he claimed to be. 

Obviously this argument is not a slam dunk, or everyone would be Christian. (Personally I don't find it convincing.) But it is basically logically sound. Scholars generally agree that the Gospels are, to a greater or lesser extent, an accurate representation of what the historical Jesus did and said. There's no *a priori* reason to discount everything miraculous in them without begging the question. ""If Jesus really did miraculously cure the sick and blind, walk and water, and rise from the dead, we may reasonably conclude that he was telling the truth about being divine"" is a logically sound statement that I agree with. 

To rationally believe in Amitabha, surely we have to believe not only that the historical Buddha did have the supernormal abilities and knowledge that he claimed to have, but also that the Pure Land sutras are an accurate record of his teachings. In my opinion, the following syllogism, if true, would be of comparable strength to the Christian apologetic syllogism given above:

1. The Pure Land sutras more or less accurately reproduce actual teachings given by the historical Buddha. 
2. The historical Buddha was a philosophical genius and morally unimpeachable; what's more, there are many eyewitness accounts of his supernormal abilities and knowledge. 
3. Therefore we can conclude he was not lying and Amitabha exists.

But unlike the Gospels, whose historical accuracy is disputed in scholarly circles mostly as a matter of degree, the Pure Land sutras are generally considered by scholars *not* to be authentic records of what the historical Buddha taught. As far as I can tell, to claim otherwise, we need to argue that... 

1. Some of the Buddha's most powerful, memorable, and popularly accessible teachings were unknown to, or not transmitted by, a large community of his followers, for some unknown reason; or,
2. They were known to his disciples but not written down until far after most of his other teachings (and then written down in a very different literary style), again for an unknown reason; or,
3. They were secreted away after the Buddha's death in some miraculous manner before being revealed again later.

Unlike the Christian apologetic syllogism described above, *all* of these options, as far as I know, require some degree of blind faith; that is, none of them have *any* rational historical claim to truth; and all of them carry the distinct scent of retconning. 

And if we accept the opinion of most(all?) scholars that the Pure Land sutras weren't actually taught by the historical Buddha, we're in an even more awkward position of having to take on faith the words of an anonymous author who was lying about where he got his information.

So... what am I missing? Am I thinking about this the wrong way? 

I realize this comes across as an attack on your belief system, but I want to emphasize that I am actually *asking a question;* I know lots of Pure Land Buddhists are smart and educated, and I want to know how they justify their faith to themselves.",Buddhism,1666203604.0,t3_y8a32a,0.61,8

Think I may have experienced ego dissolution,"I‚Äôm an 18 year old female, and last night was very strange. It all started from a friend who i have been in love with for over a year, i have never told him how I felt, last night he said ‚ÄúI love you (platonically), this is nothing unusual, he says this occasionally and I tell him I love him too. But it hurt me at first, because I know he will never see me as something more. But this led to a confusing array of questions, i cant remember much from last night specifically, except I remember feeling bad and eventually calling out to something spiritually within the universe to guide me to gain a clearer answer. The next day I woke up expecting to feel completely normal as I usually do, but I didn‚Äôt. I haven‚Äôt felt like myself all day, and I was so cripplingly aware of who I‚Äôve been in my past, how my friendship with this person was just a mirror of my bad childhood that I was subconsciously seeking out, and I immediately felt no attachment to him anymore, I still love him as a friend and we‚Äôre still friends obviously, but it was like all that pressure and my behaviour and how it negatively manifested in my friendship with him had just gone. I couldn‚Äôt feel a connection to my past identity and still can‚Äôt really, like I woke up an entirely new person. I became aware that although introspection is a good thing, I have been almost unhealthily obsessed with it, which was actually bringing me more misunderstanding than understanding. I have been questioning everything; am/was I just a performance for everybody? Is this really me?. I thought I was experiencing some symptom of a mental disorder before I realised that this feeling feels strangely similar to an ego dissolution i experienced on psychedelics a couple of years ago, although nothing about me changed after I had come down from the drugs. So then I started to look into the Buddhist side of ego dissolution (I have only been Buddhist for a few months), and realised that I‚Äôm pretty sure this is what I‚Äôm feeling. I have been practicing yoga and occasional meditation for the past few months, I would do yoga anyway before I became Buddhist but I‚Äôve been doing it more frequently since I found myself aligning with Buddhist beliefs. I‚Äôve been listening to sound baths, burning incense and I have a few crystals too that I use in different scenarios. I just really didn‚Äôt expect to feel ego dissolution this quickly, although I am seeing it as my opportunity to live in the real world and do good with my actions. I almost don‚Äôt even want to think about who I was before, I just want to live. But my question is, what do i do now? Since feeling like this, I‚Äôve almost been in a vegetative state, de-motivated but also just trying to experience the feeling, do I just carry on with my life as normal but with this achieved awareness? What if I start to lose the awareness? Should I engage more in meditation and yoga? I meditated for 10 minutes after researching ego dissolution, and im going to have a bath soon and do yoga anyway.

Mind altering substances and asceticism,"THC is a mind altering substance, so I stopped consuming it.

Caffeine is a mind altering substance, so I stopped consuming it.

Now I am thinking, perhaps all substances are mind altering substances... if so should I stop consuming all substances? This would include food, which creates a natural motivation for fasting.

Even so, as a human being a need to live life with food is superimposed upon me physiologically. So is the task at hand to minimize the extent to which we rely on substances?

In the case of fasting, the mind enters a different state. It is natural to desire food in this state... is one to fast until this desire no longer exists? This makes me think that the function of asceticism is to realize one's relationship with the material world, such that we engage with it on our own terms or by necessity.

"Isn't belief in Samsara, rebirth and liberation a form of clinging in itself? Not a slander post just a discussion of this thought I have.","The flaw with this thought is that you need to assume that after death nothing actually happens and it's just pure nothingness (like it was before birth), which contradicts the whole Buddhist rethoric already.

But if we go through with that assumption and take this point of view, doesn't Samsara and rebirth just become another sort of clinging to this world? You refuse to accept that there's nothing and come up with a system that allows you to exist after death and before birth. You cling to this existence.

Not only that but Nirvana or liberation is then the idea that you can achieve some state of bliss free from worldly suffering while still existing to some extent. This is another form of clinging to existence with ""pleasure"" included, is it not?

Experiencing Oneness and getting extreme depression afterwards,"Hi


I recently, on 21st June, for celebrating 21st of june, took LSD. During my trip I felt like all souls, all existing living beings were just one and that the universe was just made out of ""vibrations"" at the end and that the universe originally was a big, uniform sound ; and that the fact people were different people was because there have been a misunderstanding at some point, some sort of problem that once repaired would unite all beings in one and in an endless sound.


I meditated upon that for like few minutes, it felt like hours, and while I was in unity it was actually extremely pleaseant to not-feel and not-be if it makes sense 

Then I got out of my room still having this feeling that the world was one and I was one with the world, I was about to eat and then I realized that now that the whole world was united I was lonely idk, also that there was nothing to do and it was depressing as hell ? I got extremely sad and bad for few days afterwards and I was afraid that what I experienced could have actually been true ; I've thought about that a lot and read today Buddhist beliefs especially those about non-self and non-being and unity of the universe


I kinda got traumatized by experiencing this oneness, maybe because usually one should take years of meditation to reach this end and I took a shortcut to it without any prior preparation (some truths can hurt the unprepared)


I feel like I need to talk about theological stuff with buddhists especially this oneness, like is it actually what buddhism teaches ? Is it actually what you guys believe is a truth in the universe ?

If yes, what actually pushes any of you to continue to do anything in life instead of just doing nothing ?

Would a monk eat a carrot?,"A carrot is the taproot, and harvesting it requires the plant's early death.  To be edible, carrots need to be harvested before they get too woody, which is before the plant's natural death.

Does eating a carrot go against the teaching of ""do not kill""? Are we only to eat those plant parts that are readily offered by the plant for the purpose of eating (and dispersing seeds) without killing it (e.g. apples), or that otherwise do not cause death (e.g. leaves)?

Edit:. Thanks for the clarification and for pointing to Jainism for this principle. Now I need to read about sentience. The research I'm familiar with shows that plants definitely know that they've gotten damaged, whether mortally or not. Or is that more a ""reaction"" than a conscious response?

Buddhism = Nihilism?,"Hello, I am really new to Buddhism and about to deep dive into this topic.

The aim is to understand the impermanent nature of all feelings and stop craving them.

But if we stop the pursuit of those feelings, what is the point then? Just sitting around, observing your own emotions but not let them have any impact on you?

Thoughts on the paradox of spirituality in the modern era?,"I find it interesting how modern culture seems to be moving away from ethics in terms of spiritual development, yet at the same time we see a revival of spirituality within traditions like Buddhism. If we use the panchasila and the athasila, the five percepts and eight precepts to examine our culture we can see that things have been in decline over the past 200 years. This is not universal. At the level of society the standard has been raised. There are less discrimination, war and injustice. But on a more personal level it seems like people are not keeping basic moral guidelines like before. Drug use has become very common, sexual misconduct has become very common. In this age of the internet people stay constantly entertained in mostly unwholesome ways. There is sense indulgence on a completely new level in this stage of capitalism. I think there is no doubt that modernity have taken most of us away from spending our days doing wholesome things, and we are a lot more distracted. In short it is a lot harder to practice meditation and sense restraint now than at any period in history. There is so much temptation and so many things that are constantly competing for our attention.     
  

On the other hand we see that the striving for spiritual awaking has been revived over the past 200 years. Not just in Buddhism, but in other Dharma traditions and also new spiritual traditions. As far as I know in most Buddhist countries personal practice towards awakening was very niche up until the modern era. The concepts of lay people meditating was unheard of in the Theravada tradition, and the monks striving for awakening was far and few between. Today it is very different. In Theravada the forest traditions have become very popular where even the lay people strive for Nibbana. Pretty much the exact same pattern is found in the traditions of Buddhism and Vedanta too. I am guessing that this pattern can be seen in most spiritual traditions that strive for awakening. And let us not forget all the westerners flocking to these traditions even though they remain very inaccessible. It seems strange that as the world becomes more worldly (indulgent, distracted, less personal ethics), the spiritual becomes more spiritual (newfound interest in reaching supreme liberation). Just imagine a person living 500 years ago, farming, doing duties to the community, no mass media, no entertainment, food was not filled with addictive crap. Life was slow and simple. That situation is ideal for a lay person to reach awakening. Yet people did not strive for it as much as today. I wonder what is really going on?     


Could it have something to do with the dissolution of the community and late stage capitalism making work feel less meaningful that drive people towards spirituality? What are your thoughts on this?",Buddhism,1632762422.0,t3_pwlk10,0.44,0

The Daily Tejaniya : How To Deal With Trump,"    
    **YOGI:**
    A yogi asks, ‚ÄúI get enraged listening to Donald Trump
    for even a few moments. His incompetence, lies, and com-
    plete lack of ethics is causing many people needlessly to
    die. How can I deal with the rage I feel towards him?‚Äù 
    
    
    **SUT:**
    We know Donald Trump is not going to change.
    We can‚Äôt change him, but we can change the quality
    of our mind. When he comes on the TV or the Inter-
    net or wherever, just start watching your mind. Attend
    to your own mind, not to Trump. Get interested in
    how the mind is reacting, not in what Trump
    is saying or in the person of Trump.  

    We need to be very clear that it is not Trump
    but our own judgments and thoughts of rage that 
    are shattering our peace of mind. Rather than spend
    our precious moments of life on Trump, change the
    object of your awareness. Change it from thinking
    about Mr. Trump, to observing what‚Äôs happening
    in your mind, or watch your feelings so you
    don‚Äôt get pulled into the thoughts.

How can anyone believe in karma when all evidence contradicts it?,"The only way I could see anyone believing in karma is if it is fueled by hubris - that is, if believing in it boosts their ego. For instance, someone believes that the reason they are successful is because they are a good and virtuous person, therefore their karma is good and led to their success and that they deserve it; conversely, they would believe that people who are not successful are evil or spiteful, thus it is their bad karma that led them down that road and they deserve it.

We all know that is not how the world works, whether or not you are willing to admit it. Success and wealth are based purely on luck. Let‚Äôs take for an example, a good mathematician. People would make the argument that that person became so skilled because they studied hard, but that is secondary to the fact that they were LUCKY enough to be born with good genetics that predispose them to intelligence and grasping math. Probably had rich and loving parents too. Everything is about luck; if you are lucky in life, you get to have a great life, and be successful and happy. If you are unlucky, everyone looks down on you, makes fun of you, excluded you, and you struggle and suffer for your whole life. What‚Äôs more, to add insult to injury, people say it‚Äôs because of some moral failing on your part, or bad karma, or sin, or whatever other label they try to pin on you to justify to themselves why they are so great and why you are beneath them.

There are so many examples in life of people who are awful human beings yet they are rich and successful. Pretty much every wealthy person is conceited, manipulative, rude, callous, selfish, and smug. There is literally no benefit to the self to being a good, compassionate, and caring person. 

I‚Äôm sick of being a loser and a failure in life just because I wasn‚Äôt born lucky. Everything in life is luck. I‚Äôm sure there will be egotistical, arrogant, self serving jackasses on this sub who will lecture me and tell me why I‚Äôm wrong and why everything is my fault, or make glib remarks insulting me.

Summing up Buddhism in 10 lines.,"Most of you reading this are attached to a delusion based on four fundamental misperceptions:

1. Things in existence are inherently what they are. (Inherent nature)
2. This inherent nature is stable. (Stability)
3. Yourself is part of these things in existence. (Self in existence)
4. This attachment of yourself to existence can be ultimately satisfactory. (Satisfaction of self in existence)

Against these four fundamental errors, Buddhism posits four corrections, respectively:

1. Things in existence have no inherent nature. (Emptiness)
2. Everything in existence is unstable. (Instability)
3. Yourself are not part of anything which exists. (No-self)
4. Attachment of yourself to existence will never be satisfactory. (Unsatisfactoriness)


* * * * *

Now let's add bit of an explanation about Emptiness.

It's easy to understand, even at a rational level, that everything in existence is impermanent, subject to change, and eventually will atrophy to the point of unrecognizability.

Emptiness is a more fundamental insight. It disputes that anything is what it is, even when it seems to be. Emptiness cannot be formulated or taught conceptually, since among its far-reaching lessons is the invalidation of all concepts, and the refutation of any and all conceptual truth.

Here are a few pointers.

There are two conduits readily available to us Westerners to gain some insight into emptiness: dreams and art.

They are fundamentally the same thing.

Art is essentially an attack on the delusion of inherent nature of objects.

It is a vigorous effort to escape the tyranny of reality.

Dreams just ignore this tyrannical delusion altogether.

For a more accessible explanation:

Art fights the entrenched tyranny of mundane concepts. We all saw these objects, like apple, sunrise, the human body, a million times. They become strongly established in our minds as an undisputed stable truth that simply cannot be otherwise. This inherent stable nature is the fertile ground which sprouts attachment. It is the foundation that art aims to undermine and topple. In the most mundane terms, it aims to make you look at reality with a new, fresh perspective.

Also known as ""Beginner Mind"" in Zen.

More fundamentally, art seeks to dispute and undermine the established order of concepts.

An important realization to reach at this point is that there are no objects, only concepts. We have no direct contact with reality, only concepts thereof which we established by imposing symbolic name-and-form (nama-rupa) on chaotic sense impressions.

Now that we realize that all these things aren't objects, but concepts, we can see that both art and dreams annihilate them in the same ways:

They mash them together, cut them apart, break them down to little pieces, and switch or replace them with each other.

More systematically, there are 3 fundamental mechanisms to attack those tyrannical concepts:

1. Mash them together, combining multiple concepts into a unified one.
2. Separate and break them apart, sometimes into little pieces.
3. Displace them (switch or replace one with another).

These mechanisms can and often do work together. For example: breaking multiple concepts into pieces, then combining some of these pieces into a new unified concept.

The necessity to dispute order is why art can seem random. Being ""random"" - i.e. deviating from the established conceptual order - is in fact a necessary condition for any artistic expression.

For example, [here's a musical piece about Boston's Waste Management System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hsA6jxsGJU).

Traditional Buddhist techniques to help disciples realize Emptiness include meditation, koans, abrupt actions performed by the teacher to surprise and shake the student's mind away from its entrenched conceptual tracks, shouting, and beating.

You will notice that at least four of those are Zen techniques, and indeed Zen is quite focused on imparting the insight of Emptiness.",Buddhism,1549015003.0,t3_am0isa,0.53,1

"I believe that people who ""want to become Buddhist"" have an attachment to fashion (and cheap malas).","When I was younger, all my friends listened to a particular band. That genre of music was very different from the style of music that I naturally gravitated to, but because I was motivated to fit in, I ended up appreciating that music. 

The genre of music was country, and I, with sheer will and determination, liked country music and musicians like Confederate Railroad, Dwight Yoakam, Brad Paisley, etc. 

It then occurred to me, that a person can absolutely love anything, any genre of music, any school of architecture, any fashion trends, and can harbor any opinions just by dint of trying to fit in. 

For people ""wanting to become Buddhist,"" my advice to you is this: The same motivation that you have to learn the Dharma, I say use this energy to:

* empathize, understand, and be excited helping persecuted people in your own community - the ""nerds,"" the elderly, the unpopular kids at school, the undesirable person who sits by themselves at lunch, and the people who are shunned, etc. 

* ask yourself: Do I really know the cultural environment from which Buddhism sprang from and spent its formative years? DO you know anything about the cultural under-pinnings of Buddhism, or anything about religions that came from the same foundations? I'm sure a practicing Christian knows far more about the various tribes of Israel and even pre-Christians like the Samaritans, Hebrews, Judea Province, and King David, but the Buddhists don't know anything about Jainism or Sikhism.

According to the news, [""a Buddhist mob rampaged through a town in an isolated corner of Myanmar, hacking Muslim women and children with knives""](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/16/mynanmar-buddhist-mob-kills-muslims_n_4610496.html?utm_hp_ref=religion&ir=Religion).

This piece of news hit me like lightning. I didn't know that Buddhism could nest such kind of behaviors. I knew that there are religious tensions in Asia between Buddhists and Muslims, but would've never thought that Buddhists could commit such abominable acts.

Whereas other fundamentalist religions bear hints of tolerating conflict in some circumstances in their scriptures, the Buddhist teachings are organically against any kind of violence. So what has happened in Myanmar is beyond my comprehension and an utter shock for me. I have been dreaming that Buddhism is an oasis of peace and tolerance and now I don't know anymore.

So what could be done about this abomination? That mob should be let know that they are not Buddhist at all.

I took this to mean to avoid being so drunk or high that you lose sight of who you are, but am I misreading. To be a sincere Buddhist, should I quit smoking?",Buddhism,1375510139.0,t3_1jm4jq,0.48,0
Christianity vs. Buddhism,"I was raised a in a devout Christian family. I rejected the religion at a very early age, however my mother still clings to it and most of our family friends remain Christians as well. Throughout most of my life these family friends  have been nothing short of judgmental and neurotic all in the name of Christianity (which seems to be against everything that Christ taught), and this is partially what drove me away from the religion. Most Buddhists or those studying eastern philosophies, however, have been (from my perspective) extraordinarily kindhearted and compassionate individuals, free from many of the bad tendencies that many of our Christian friends had.
In addition, my father was a Christian throughout most of his life, however about 5 or so years ago he made a quiet transition from Christianity to Buddhism. Before that, he and my mother constantly fought and he was in a bad mood a lot of the time. Since ""converting"" (he attends church only when my mother requires it) it is almost like a new person was created entirely; every bad habit or tendency he had before has completely vanished and he has recently become a vegetarian as well.

In essence, I was wondering what were some of your thoughts pertaining to why it seems that Buddhism is succeeding where Christianity is failing. I have observed this time and time again, in which the actions of Buddhists differ greatly from the actions of Christians, while many of Christ's teachings seem to be in line with Buddhist thought. 

Yes, I realize this is not *always* the case and that I might be all over the page here, however I'd still like to know where this disconnect occurs and what some of your thoughts are on the subject.",Buddhism,1373613990.0,t3_1i527h,0.56,2

" Eating meat, or not eating meat, is not at all what the point buddha was trying to point at.","My experience here has been that the concept of vegetarianism reducing suffering, or veganism reducing suffering, or whatever else there is in that kind of thought I am not sure of, is something worth striving towards. it is only partially true. at best. Animals live in the realm of being food for other animals. only humans (most, at least, some adventurers obviously do not share that fate) are excluded from that. and the point behind buddhism is not to make some kind of paradise on earth; such a thing could never happen. the point is to get rid of the ideas and concepts of life and death itself. only then can you actually be free.

Can some of our Theravada members consider being a little less... transparently sectarian when people ask for advice on beginning with Buddhism?,"I feel like there's a divide between what people recommend to new people asking for general information, where most posters link to fairly broad non-sectarian resources, and some posters from Theravada traditions exclusively link to Theravada resources. I understand that the relationship between Theravada and Mahayana historically hasn't been the most sectarianism-free, but it's starting to be consistent enough that it feels somewhat like bad faith sectarianism.

I'm a Tibetan Buddhist, and you can find recent posts in my post history agreeing that the Dhammapada is not a bad starting point for a very broad overview of Buddhism. I have little issue directing people towards resources that are heavy on Theravada material because I'd rather people practice the Dharma than not, and if Theravada practices work for them then that's commendable, but it's beginning to leave a bit of a bad taste in my mouth, personally. I don't know if I'm alone in this perspective, and if so I'll take the L and move on with my day, but I'd really like to see a more concerted effort at non-denominational advice when people come seeking new things.

This *especially* goes for presenting Theravada historiography as inherently true; both teachings have equal (historical) claim to originality. While I understand the Theravadin perspective differs on this, the subtle implication of the illegitimacy of Mahayana does show up in many of these posts. We can be better, and we can be less sectarian.

**edit:** from u/xugan97
 
>I see a common misconception in the comments. The problem is not with quoting suttas - or Theravada authorities like Buddhaghosha - but with claiming that these are the only original texts of Buddhism.

Non-Violence taken to an extreme seems like a luxury and a cop-out,"I‚Äôm sorry, but there are children being sold into sex slavery every day. If Buddhism teaches non-violence to the extreme of not cracking down on perps of these sorts of demented things, where is the logic? How is it righteous to only be open to acts of gentle service, but be against the ferocity required when defending the innocent from tyranny?
This is not to say violence should be used as a first resort, but there are many situations in which defense is necessary, especially through the lens of seeing how it effects those unable to defend themselves. Most Buddhists I have met are single, have no children, do not have a connection to society other than acts of service, which is helpful and good, but does not encompass all of the ways humans find themselves interacting on this earth. If I had had the chance to kill Jeffrey Epstein, I would have done it. It‚Äôd be great if he would have healed, but if I had had the opportunity to end his time here, I would have done it for the sake of his victims.

Buddhist Interpretation of Pok√©mon Cosmology,"In the Pok√©mon franchise, several things seem to be true that seem to draw an analogy to Buddhist teachings.

In Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl, the main antagonist's goal is to escape suffering and he identifies 'Spirit' or 'Heart' as the main culprit. He believes the human spirit is flawed and would prefer to live in a world that is devoid of spirits. Through various means, he tries to forcefully create a new world that was 'pure' and without spirit.

When I came across a basic explanation of Pure Land buddhism, I was reminded of this plot, so I explored it a bit more.

Buddhism assumes no Creator, but in various teachings that are passed down, it is also said that, rather than creating themselves and then the planes, deities descend to planes of existence at their creation (for as far as the concept of a beginning and end applies) to shape it. In the pok√©mon franchise, Arceus appears to be fulfilling a similar role, descending from another plane and then using emanations of himself to order it. The pok√©mon world has always been the world of kami from Shinto religion, but this makes me wonder if perhaps it is also meant emulate pure land.

The pok√©mon franchise also makes clear that this is but one in a massive web of world, which reminded me of the Net of Indra. Which in turn reminded me that, in the pok√©mon world, that 'net' may be more literal than simply an analogy to explain the interpenetration of the dharma. Residents in the pok√©mon world do not question that they can exchange pok√©mon with residents of other realities.",Buddhism,1636377490.0,t3_qpdgax,0.58,3

About the gods.,"One of the things I see so often here, is a casual disregard, a misunderstanding and fundamental lack of empathy regarding deities. 

Because of this, I want to set the record straight on their behalf. It means more to me than is so often quoted. If any of you are actually a real Buddhist, then you will understand. 

Gods are people. They are, fundamentally no different than us. In realms without the teaching, many of them live lives of service to others. The weight of hundreds, of thousands of years is behind that statement. 

Many gods see the Dharma, and they eventually become Dharma protectors. Many, Many gods choose this path. I've seen enough to know that, statistically speaking, any random god more likely to achieve enlightenment than any random human weighted on balance with time.. This is a fact. The reason it's taught otherwise has more to do with accumulation and what was, rather than anything else. Time does not move at same pace betwen realms. 

I guess, what I want you guys to understand is how much they are there for us. They're the ones that in our practice whisper to us when we lose our way and fall short. They're the ones that facilitate the most basic aspects of our ability to practice. If you've ever experienced intervention, 9/10 it's them. That is the reality of this world. 

They are us. They are every wish we ever had and the manifestation of our metta. At least, many do their best to be. I just.. want you guys to know. So often the invisible voice that brings you to the next point.. it's them. More than anything else, they are people. People who push us forward and help us overcome in our practice. It  is always them. The Dharma protectors.

Never ever look down on the gods. Many of them are buddhists and do their absolute best for the sake of others.

As lacking as I am, this at least I've seen. I guess I just wanted people to know. So, so few understand just how hard they work, what they actually do. Thank you for reading.",Buddhism,1689881064.0,t3_1550jlw,0.65,18

One can live within his or her own personal hell through reaping the kammic fruit of a wrong action in the here and now, or he will be reborn in the hell realms after death if that kammic fruit hasn‚Äôt ripened at death.",Buddhism,1687844090.0,t3_14k4lot,0.54,1
Unanswerable questions in the context of Buddhist cosmology,"I‚Äôve been reading some about sets of questions that the Buddha categorized as unanswerable such as a precise model of karma / its results, the ultimate origin of this universe, whether this universe is spatially infinite, the existence of a Tathagata after death, etc. I think there‚Äôs great value to be had in discerning when a question is ill-formed, unanswerable and/or untestable. I have a lot of respect for the Buddha for steering his students away from such fruitless wonderings. 

> ‚Ä¶ Some questions are skillful in that they provide a useful context for putting an end to suffering, whereas others are not. ‚Ä¶ the Buddha would answer only the questions that provided an answer to our primal question and helped put an end to suffering and stress. Questions that would get in the way, he would put aside, because the problem of stress and suffering is urgent
> ‚Äî Thanissaro Bhikku 

> The Buddha always told his disciples not to waste their time and energy in metaphysical speculation. Whenever he was asked a metaphysical question, he remained silent. ‚Ä¶ Life is so short. It must not be spent in endless metaphysical speculation that does not bring us any closer to the truth.
> ‚ÄîThich Nhat Hanh 

Given the apparent emphasis on practical teaching, what‚Äôs up with the extremely complex cosmological model in mainstream Buddhism? These claims are so beyond human experience/verification that they must be regarded as metaphysical. They are so fantastical and also specific that they are totally ascientific. Floating mansions in the air for beings that live for thousands of years ‚Äî really? Indeed, some of these realms are formless, and so there‚Äôs no material interaction to be had, no basis upon which one might design an experiment to support a testable model. And that‚Äôs totally leaving aside that these realms supposedly facilitate conscious awareness in the absence of a physical substrate. 

Why bother teaching about them? How are they useful towards the cessation of suffering? What purpose does it serve? If the point is to indicate that liberation takes a long time and nothing lasts forever, why not just say that? If they‚Äôre simply metaphors for states of mind, which seems most practical, why not just say that?

A lot of the Buddha‚Äôs teachings and very reasonable and practical, but I‚Äôm struggling to find any utility in this intricate cosmology. To take it as literally and physically real is just incomprehensible, and so far removed from the otherwise grounded and immediately applicable teachings. I get the whole arguing with the doctor about who shot the poisoned arrow and what the arrow was made of etc. Is this complex cosmological model not just yet another distraction from receiving the medicine that would end the suffering? How does it actually help any living being?

It seems to me to just be a cultural, mythological trapping. But I‚Äôm open to and eager to learn of any better explanation.

How does Buddhism fulfill the need for human relationships,"I'm sorry but this entire religion just doesn't seem to me to hit the fundamental  for human relationships very well. Everything from the Buddha going off to meditate on his own for a long time as the way to enlightenment, to the fact that monks do the same, to the way some of the Suttas I've read preach a detached loner lifestyle (like the rhino horn one,) to the fact that in order to truly detach and let go one must let go of their human attachments as well... I'm sorry but this just seems too hard for me to swallow. I'm already extremely lonely and it's killing me. I can't imagine accepting that loneliness and continuing to live alone.

3. It talked about how there could be thousands of Jesus's

4. It talked about Earth being heaven and the diety we worship is the God of Heaven.

5. It talked about the 7 levels you have to go through in life before reaching Enlightenment.

6. It talked about each day being one year. Noon = Summer, Morning = Spring Midnight=Winter, Evening = Fall

7. It talked about how those who have not learned there lesson in this life will be forced to re-live it again, and again until they do.

8. It talked about how we should all strive to become Bodisattva

Sexual misconduct in the sutras,"It was my understanding that the sexual misconduct in the five precepts related to adultery, rape, or having sex with a celibate monk. I was [reading an early sutra](https://read.84000.co/translation/toh287.html#UT22084-068-021-42) from the Kangyur and was surprised to see it was against oral sex and anal sex exclusively.

> ...sexual misconduct occurs when one penetrates one‚Äôs own wife, or another man‚Äôs wife, through an opening other than the vagina, or when one rejoices in others performing such an act, or when one makes others engage in it even while refraining from doing so oneself. 

If you don't end up in hell, as an animal, or hungry ghost, this bad karma may ripen as having a disrespectful wife in the next life OR being born a [hermaphrodite](https://read.84000.co/translation/toh287.html#UT22084-068-021-59). 

I'm not a scriptural fundamentalist and I think it can often be clear which parts are political and worldly and which are truly inspired and holy. But this surprised me, especially since it does not include adultery. 

Also, Buddhism is considered to be welcoming to all people in modern times, but I can't help but wonder what a gay man or other LGBTQIA+ persons might think reading this.

I did this for the first time without planning it or knowing what I was doing and I achieved a great sense of enlightenment. I was overwhelmed with the sense of it and It felt dizzying. I felt that I had done something that had a great effect on my being. I focused on my place in the universe and the complete insignificance of it. I then felt a rush throughout my body. I felt amazing afterward.


After this,  I continued to do this for a brief time in my childhood. I was excited to go to bed knowing that I was going to ""meditate"" and the rush that I would get. 
 It eventually fizzled out and I more or less completely forgot about it.

I didn't really think about it again until years later when apps like headspace and calm brought meditation back to my attention.

I have since tried guided meditation a fair bit and have found it to be very good for sleeping and to have some good mental health benefits for me but i have never been able to properly get into the state of mind that I had as a child and fully relax, or achieve and enlightenment. 

I blame this on the stresses of modern adult life such as work, marriage,  children, mobile phones etc 

I was able to fully engage without guided meditation as a child and achieve something that is still with me to this day. Whereas now I find it hard to even relax enough to organise my breathing to do a session of guided meditation on calms app.


Is anyone able to relate to this. I would be interested in other peoples experiences",Buddhism,1634679580.0,t3_qblocx,0.54,1
Does suffering exist? Why isn't Buddhism monistic? How far does non-dualism go?,"I have read that Buddhism does not take anything to exist or not exist, to put it crudely. This seems to be untenable as Buddhism seems quite sure of the existence of suffering. Following that, it must be necessary for something  - with existence - to be suffering. I think therefore I am.  How far does non-dualism go? Is existence not necessary to understand anything and must be assumed?  There is not even a first step without the assumption of existence.

I came to this question because, to my understanding, Buddhism is monistic. Is Nirvana not much like Kant's Thing-In-Itself and Schopenhauer's Will, which is completely unconditioned yet can still be said to exist? I don't think the Thing-In-Itself contradicts non-self, as it is indistinguishable from any other thing. It is everything after all. 

Please help me understand why Buddhism is not monistic.",Buddhism,1634214438.0,t3_q7ynmh,0.5,0

I would like some real advice on this,"I need some advice

Hello everyone! Long time lurker and first time actually posting here. I want to tell everyone a story here and I would like some opinions.



I‚Äôm going to pre-face the story with some things about myself and we can get into it from there, I am a ‚Äúwhite‚Äù (not really) man who was in the military to be exact to the infantry. Since getting out of the military and moving on to different things in my life, I have had a overhaul and a rehaul of who I am as a human being. I am a Yogi, I am a vegetarian, and I have converted to Buddhism. I am by no means perfect but I live my life as a secular Buddhist the best way I can. 


Currently I work at a small family bar and French bistro in Arizona. It is a very prosperous bar, upscale and the new thing on the block. We get immense traffic and it‚Äôs great. 


Since day one of working at this establishment, I have been met with some resistance from one of the owners nieces. She is as she puts it ‚Äúwoke, an activist, gay, a feminist‚Äù she is Hispanic, (and whiter than I, who is native and Moroccan and Portuguese but I don‚Äôt give a shit about race so I just say ‚Äúwhite‚Äù as I am fair skinned and slightly tanned) And from the first day of us meeting has made very rude comments to me that I can only subscribe as to things that would get someone immediately terminated. 

The comments first started with her telling me to my face in front of coworkers that she judges me for being a white man that‚Äôs an imperialist from the military who has committed war crimes, which of course is a straw man if I ever heard one. I wonder if she knows that I, with my unit, rescuers 100 woman out of sex slavery in Africa? Goes against her agenda so most likely not. Anyway. 

Things have slowly reached a tipping point, lastly with her telling me that it‚Äôs disgusting that a white man thinks he can be a Yogi or a Buddhist. The other day we had an incident at work where she was sticking up for a table and not the server even though the table was harassing the server to try to get free food, the table happen to be two women. As I was explaining the situation to the owner she started chiming in with small snippets about how I don‚Äôt know that table, they were nice to her, and I‚Äôm being judgmental. When I looked at her and I asked her are you doing this because I am a man and those are women or because I‚Äôm a white man and those are black women? She responded with and I quote ‚Äú you white piece of shit misogynistic motherfucker fuck you and your white family‚Äù and stormed off in front of customers. Mind you I work at a nice place, not a damn chili‚Äôs. The evidence will also show, to the kangaroo court in session, that the true colors came out when she was called out. Instead of helping and backing up her female teammate who is new, she immodestly and effectively begins to take sides when she has no idea what‚Äôs going on. It‚Äôs the most obvious case of identity politics at a ground level I have ever seen, in a damn upscale bar of all places!

After speaking with the owner, it has become apperantly that the issue is me. I‚Äôm ‚Äúwhite‚Äù, I‚Äôm a male, I‚Äôm what you would consider not a beta man (I will not use the word alpha, so cringe) but I am tall, muscular, I box, I‚Äôm kind of loud and fun. I‚Äôm your typical dude. Except I‚Äôm a philanthropist, activist, and scholar. This woman‚Äôs entire identity and her views is to be against someone like myself. She knows it, I know it, the management knows it. 



The owner became infuriated with the situation, obviously not myself but with her. My question to everyone here is this is a group of thinkers philosophers and people in the realm of law and ethics, how should I respond to this? If this was any other company with an HR she would be terminated, in fact she would‚Äôve been terminated months ago for her actions toward me that I have documented in email and on my phone. If this was any other race or sex of person in the roles were reversed there would be a lawsuit, full stop. 

Being that I walk or try to at least a different path in life, I will not be asking for her to be fired nor will I be asking for a lawsuit or trying to obtain any damages but my question to everyone here is how do you see the best way of going around rectifying this? Nothing I‚Äôve said here is exaggerated and it is the full spectrum of what she has said to me among other things she said. Does anyone see a real way around this? I could easily get another job where I making just as much money which is around 300 a day but, why do that when I can try to bounce some ideas off of my fellow secularist, humanist, and Buddhist.",Buddhism,1622485436.0,t3_np9vd5,0.45,0

"Brahman is real, just empty on a larger scale","So for context, I went to school to study astrophysics before getting into spirituality. Brahman as a concept always made sense with the science we see. All of matter is actually just condensed energy emerging from a latent field that permeates everything. We are like waves in the ocean, not seperate from the ocean, but made up of it. 
But I also recognize emptiness as true. Everything is dependant on everything else, there is no inherent nature to any individual. The blade of grass is as much the water it drinks, as it is the sun it grows under. But we cannot ignore that physics does tell is there is an essence in this universe. So my thought is, Brahman is real, is the energetic foundation of this universe. But this isn't the only universe, not the only Brahman. So while Brahman is real, it is empty in connection to a wider omniverse. 
Is this a thought others have had? I feel strongly drawn to Buddhism, but I cannot deny Brahman as a concept is valid. This seems like a good middle way.",Buddhism,1611775509.0,t3_l6cahe,0.45,0

Buddhism leads to the extinction of mankind,"Dhamma teaches us to overcome desire. The moral rules therefore include that one must live in complete chastity, which is totally understandable. But if all the people in the world lived according to dhamma, humanity would die out, because there would be no reproduction. And is a teaching the right one if it leads to the extinction of humanity? In my opinion: No, it isn't. I like the Buddha, I like dhamma. But this one thought is still the one that keeps me from accepting it as the truth. 
Of course, it is very unlikely that everyone in the world would follow the teaching. But it is important in morality, which you think is the right one and you want to live according to it and spread it further, to use the categorical imperative of Immanuel Kant: Act only according to that¬†maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.

"I think the beauty of music, art, and mathematics is associated with Jhana, and hints at the nature of Nirvana","I often attain Jhana, or strengthen an ongoing Jhana, by becoming absorbed in the beauty of a musical piece, an artistic work, or a mathematical insight.

The same logic which the Buddha applied to his first Jhana, applies here: it is a wholesome pleasure, entirely divorced of sensuality or any unwholesome state.

An effect so profound has to penetrate all the way to the deepest nature - to Nirvana.

I was slightly disappointed to read that Theravadin monks were forbidden from listening to music. My guess is that this is an archaic rule from a time when music had to be played live, typically in the context of some unwholesome revelry. I am sure the Buddha would not condemn a [piece like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3x18VxqdLk).

Today, he was speaking to 2 girls, and he didn't include me. He didn't even say hey to me. He made no attempt to say hello to me either. 

The people at this sanga are interested in Buddhism because they were interested in a practice that could benefit them and make them more calm and mindful (that's the outwards reason that they give), instead of wanting to benefit OTHERS. Moreover, my suspicion is that these sanga members are very status oriented and are attending this sanga as a sort of an intellectual achievement or a source of prestige.

I love my girlfriend very much and have learned to recognize the ""formless"" within her. It's not her physical body I am attached to, it's the bond we have of our souls. Unfortunately, Buddhism states that you must let go of all attachments. I simply believe that a man and woman partnership is like the yin yang and can be spiritually healing. I can understand removing the attachment, the value you think the person will add in your life, but not celibacy. Sex can be spiritually healing and rejuvenating! Why is sex condemned then?

Vast Impersonal Intelligence,"I had an intense peak experience recently, which I revisited some aspects of my previous realizations/experience.

There is a vast impersonal natural intelligence which is living you, or rather, it IS this life, this breathing, this walking, this drinking... this life of the universe, of the earth spinning, .... all an interconnected play of Dharma, of total life, intelligence, and awareness. The only blockage is simply this sense of an 'I', someone who controls will and dictates actions in life.

If you think that I am sounding like an advocate of 'God', I have to reiterate that this so called 'God' or intelligent Mind is empty of its own existence apart from Dharma (whatever sensed, experienced, cognized), is not something changeless and independent, and is not some sort of source acting behind the scenes or pulling the strings. Because this vast impersonal intelligence is so magnificent, powerful and impersonal, it can give the impression that we are all just the dream or expression of a Universal Mind of God, and if we follow this 'personification' and 'reification' we may start to think whether we are living in a matrix, a dream of Shiva for no other reason than his own enjoyment. But we are not the play or lila of a Brahman, there is no need to personify or reify this at all. This intelligence IS the miracle of manifestation. The divine has no face of its own, and yet every face is the face of divinity. There is no I, no perceiver, or a controller of this spontaneous intelligent happening. Living this is living in complete ecstasy and joy born of this total intelligence, life and clarity.

I just found something by Daniel Ingram which pretty much describes it nicely:

""Thus, sensations of effort are just sensations of effort, but imply no fundamental split off entity that is making this effort. It is just a natural product of the interdependent universe. Just so, the sense of a will is replaced with a mysterious sense of absolutely natural causality and a natural, creative ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù that operates in all of this, though the sensations that make up the sense of will continue as before. This is what is meant in the teachings of the twelve links of dependent origination when it says, ‚ÄúWith the complete cessation of [fundamental] ignorance, volitional formations cease.‚Äù Similarly, sensations of intimacy are just sensations of intimacy and simply imply proximity rather than a separate self. Those of third path know this to some degree, and those of second path can look into this to try to attain the understanding of third path. Arahats have fully understood this.""
(note: his definition of 'Arahat' is different from the suttas definition)

Also in moments of peak experience, I see we have to overcome the habitual tendencies of distracted thoughts... means we must be able to completely silent our mind and be able to have no thoughts at all to fully experience the fullness and presence of our six senses without a single trace of thought or sense of self... the trees, the sky, the breeze, everything in its complete intensity without thoughts. I'm not saying thought must be stopped at all moments, but like Eckhart Tolle said, after awakening 90% of his (unnecessary) thoughts just disappeared and thats what make a difference to his life. Without this we will not be able to feel the intensity of total Presence. So meditate and do yoga. Realization alone is insufficient without shamatha. Yes, you can experience anatta even when there are wandering thoughts because it is always already so, but one can never fully appreciate the Presence, total life, intelligence and awareness... it is a whole different level.

In other words: thoughts are ok, but you must have 'mastery' over them. Means unnecessary thoughts do not arise.",Buddhism,1427073510.0,t3_2zyq9n,0.45,0
Could Psychedelics be used to aid Buddhist practices?,"""Traditional mainstream Buddhist training does not include the use of mind-altering substances. With very few possible exceptions, they are simply not mentioned in the sutras and other texts. Some think that they are dealt with in the precept that states *""a disciple of the Buddha does not intoxicate mind or body of self or others"".* Others think differently: the same poll mentioned above found that almost 60% of the responding Buddhist practitioners felt that psychedelics and Buddhism do mix and that they would consider taking psychedelics in a sacred context (in the ""under 20"" category this percentage was 90%). The traditional understanding of intoxicants refers to all mental and physical phenomena that foster confusion through fanning our likes and dislikes. And as the Buddha never fails to point out, ultimately everybody has to decide for themselves what is what.""

There's no greater peace than the cessation of thought,"To be able to stop inner discourse is bliss.

This skill is very precious, it frees you from your own thoughts.

Free your mind from itself, from words and concepts. Understand that they are mere illusions. They are tools that can become traps.

Never remain in what is called the formless realm of thought too long, or it will trap you.

If you find yourself with your mind not being able to stand still, your sight blurry, your hearing being annoyed by any sound or word, your touch insensitive, your nose dry, your body tired and low in energy, drowsy; stay in contemplation, be still in observation. Be energetic, or it will drown you. Soon disease will attack you, emotions will be uncontrollable, and bad karma will follow. Do not panic, remember that your nature is that of the buddha, perfect and enlightened, remember there's no reason to be not ok; there's nothing we actually need, nothing that can actually affect us, we only convince ourselves deeply that it does affect us.

Stay in contemplation, assume whatever bad karma you may have created knowing that it too shall pass not in sadness, but in understanding that it's nothing but dust traveling in your path, and focus. This will take you out of samsara quick enough.",Buddhism,1394175421.0,t3_1zsipi,0.5,0
Thoughts on what buddhism is.,"The practice of buddhism is essentially the adjusting of the components of one's psychological reward system to be primarily items over which one has the most immediate dominion so that overall satisfaction--and hopefully wellbeing generally--is as accessible and reliable as possible. Additionally, developing a strong foundational reward system configuration is beneficial to the process of conducting ventures to achieve additional satisfaction in realms over which one has less dominion than the items already secured in one's psychological reward system. This is because coming at a new task from an already-existing position of strength and moderate satisfaction is more effective than an approach dominated by an attitude of desperation and weakness.

The most objective manifestation of this process is found in the practice of meditation, a process that distances the conscious mind from its normal thinking routine. This routine is that of constantly exploring, re-exploring, and over-exploring one's real or imagined needs and wants and the various urgent tasks required to achieve them. The non-meditating mind appears to be in a state of overactive commentery on one's life and anything remotely relevant to it. Some non-meditative activities, such as entertainment, are popular because they seem to distract this state of overactive commentery from doing its work on the self and onto other things. 

The difference between entertainment and meditation is that while entertainment distracts the mind from the its life by redirecting the perpetual commentery and mental activity to another object, meditation allows the mind to truly rest and regain stamina by seeking to quiet this tiring activity. To focus one's attention solely on the breath requires the mind to adjust its pace and energy from that required to integrate and interact with a complex smattering of facts and ideas to that required to merely patiently observe a slow and gentle binary physiological process. Doing this repeatedly helps nudge out items unskillfully placed in one's psychological reward system.",Buddhism,1391842024.0,t3_1xc9k3,0.5,0
Secular Humanism and Secular Buddhism,"Perhaps the biggest difference between Humanism and Buddhism is that Humanism is a set of principles to be believed and followed, and Buddhism is a path to be practiced. Essential to the notion of a ‚Äúpath‚Äù is the distinction between where we are now and where we are headed. Humanism has philosophical parents, such as the Stoics, that recall Buddhist principles, but it will perhaps be instructive (following philosophers like Owen Flanagan) to use Aristotle‚Äôs approach to ethics as an apt comparison to the Buddhist path.

For Aristotle the aim of philosophy is to bring us well-being or ‚Äúeudaimonia‚Äù. One who lives a life of eudaimonia is distinguished from the the many (‚Äúhoi polloi‚Äù), who do not aim at the highest good. Similarly, Buddhism distinguishes samsaric existence, unstable and hence unsatisfactory, from the potential to attain a more reliable state of well-being or ‚Äúnirvana‚Äù.

Unresolvable Plurality in Buddhist Metaphysics?,"The moral force of karma derives from the notion that we must live with the consequences of our actions and that even death is no barrier to the consequences being visited on us (or someone linked to us in a way we care about). It is fundamentally fear of negative consequences, particularly a bad rebirth, that pushes the unawakened Buddhist to be ethical; and the prospect of liberation from repeated death that pulls them along. This implies that the person who lives out the consequences of my present actions must in some way still be me. I must feel a sense of ownership over my actions and their consequences. In other words karma implies some kind of personal continuity or it doesn't make sense in human terms.

Ikeda's Cult of Personality Synonymous to Idol Worship within the SGI.,"A Cult of Personality tantamount to idol worship is evidenced by the extreme obsession of SGI members for their ultimate hero and frequently personal savior (otherwise known as master/mentor), Daisaku Ikeda.  Individual members will vehemently deny worshiping the ground he walks on, but close observation of the SGI membership behavior and attitude reveals how the organization consistently places a superhuman-like Ikeda high upon a pedestal of adornment, elevated far beyond all others.  Since the embarrassingly mud-slinging split between SGI (lay org) and NST (temple Org) two decades ago over control of the vast membership and its potentially enormous monetary donations, the push by SGI to establish Ikeda as absolutely essential to each member's personal practice has only deepened and intensified, further pressing home the point regarding the claims that the unelected, unselected, self-appointed, and unaccountable Ikeda and his SGI empire do indeed qualify as a religious cult. (Note: not trying to claim here that something positive can never result from associating with this organization - just pointing out some grotesquely major flaws in the organization‚Äôs dogmatic doctrines that are contradictory with the essence and spirit of Buddhism as commonly understood and accepted).  

Ikeda is presented to the members as a father figure, whose requisite guidance is absolutely indispensable to maintaining so-called ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù faith.  The CULTivation of a special magical relationship gushing with emotional devotion for Ikeda by each member is obligatory for advancement in practice and/or leadership position by SGI. This characteristic of the SGI alone should begin to set off warning bells with anyone interested in joining, as well as for those newer members not yet spell bound and ensnared by polished propaganda and constant pressure by leaders to ""make a determination‚Äù to get ""closer"" to the perpetually unapproachable master/mentor.    

Ikeda is regarded by the SGI as the equal of Gandhi and M.L. King, and in hushed tones, even as the Buddha of modern times.  He is treated with super-star status by the membership (a feat devotedly enabled by generating mentor propaganda to the membership by his organization's leaders). His books and publications fill SGI bookstores to the brim, where members are constantly pressured by leaders or through sales campaigns to buy in-house publications and to purchase subscriptions that provide enormous profits.  Members have been known to sacrifice their homes, personal finances, and life savings (and sometimes even spousal relationships) in order to provide cripplingly large and often unaffordable monetary donations during regular SGI contribution campaigns. The SGI even has a program to help arrange legal documentation so that the SGI (and consequently Ikeda) will automatically receive your estate instead of your family upon your death. Ikeda has become a multi-billionaire that has built his enormous wealth upon the backs of countless unpaid hard working, dedicated, well-intentioned, and purposefully mentally-conditioned membership, programmed to volunteer themselves into a sleep-deprived oblivion, while unknowingly advancing the unscrupulous objectives of Ikeda to obtain ever increasing amounts of wealth and power by their supposedly flawless  mentor/master.  

The SGI reinforces the artificial importance and magnitude of Ikeda in the indoctrinated minds (attending schools be they public or religious almost universally deliver indoctrinated minds) of members through many different means. One example:  the indication that no other human alive could be as awesome as Ikeda at dispensing wise and magnificent guidance. Or in another example, the unwritten direction regarding the placement of his picture directly upon their altars, or hanging beside the altar on the wall. An even more bizarre example exists in the self-surrendering acceptance of Ikeda by each member as his or her life-long master (mentor). For many decades, the overly self-indulgent Ikeda has enjoyed the jet-setting idolized rock star lifestyle of the ultra-privileged elite while hidden behind closed gates, limos, army of bodyguards, and presidential hotel suites, He has long enjoyed his celebrity status while misusing adoring disciples to serve as hand servants and vassals for his personal prestige, while steadily building his corrupt empire, financial holdings, and counterfeit appearance of legitimacy. Ikeda‚Äôs thinly disguised level of total control and influence over the minds and hearts of SGI members is appalling to the average Buddhist or the outside observer and hard as rock evidence of indulgence in cult behavior.

Soka Gakkai and Ikeda also established a powerful political party with the intention of taking control of the Japanese government‚Äôs parliamentarian Diet. Ikeda and his radical followers have been convicted of criminal interference with elections. Soka Gakkai members under Ikeda's leadership are widely known in Japan for their extreme and militant behavior, and excessively radical forced conversion methods. Furthermore, Ikeda has used his massive wealth to purchase precious artworks and to obtain a garish number of university degrees, and has used internally publicized ‚Äúdialogues‚Äù with highly recognized and influential individuals in an obtuse attempt to establish legitimacy and credibility both within and beyond his wealthy and powerful organization.  

Ikeda's carefully concealed ego and lust for power underlie his crafted meteoric rise to the top of the SGI organizational pyramid, where he commands millions (mostly in Japan) of deluded and obsessed minions as they lovingly hang upon his every word (leaders having sworn to ""give their lives"" for the continual expansion of the SGI organization, otherwise known as the twisted and tormented goal of ""World Peace"" - where Ikeda and his SGI would rule the world through their religious organization with absolute authority and power over all others.)  However, none of these aspects would be immediately apparent to anyone naively attending a discussion (conversion) meeting or being love-bombed by happily zealous Ikeda-bots into joining the SGI (because making a conversion is considered to be a massive karmic benefit for‚Ä¶  the gain-motivated member that receives credit for the conversion).  How twisted is a top-down organization that encourages over-indulgence and greed by example, including guidance to chant for anything one may desire - with little or no concern of bad karma created by unwise choices.

As death approaches for the elderly Ikeda (if not already here - how would anyone know for sure?), Ikeda‚Äôs lackluster son is being groomed to take over the leadership of the SGI in a brash move that would establish an ongoing Ikeda family dynasty of SGI presidents.  The imagined heroic martyrdom of the father will be forever established while the adoration of all SGI members would be magically transferred to his undistinguished and not so illustrious son, and would introduce a tradition similar to the current family dictatorship ruling  North Korea.  

Any one of the preceding statements regarding Ikeda/SGI should warrant serious caution and reflection, but taken together, demand extreme prudence and further independent research into the SGI and its cult behavior as exhibited by Ikeda, his SGI empire, and its self-perpetuating obsession with establishing Ikeda as the supreme mentor (master) of all Buddhists.  Regarding one‚Äôs former faith, there is NO tolerance, only lip-service to tolerance - if you've been with a different sect or religion, your old religious or meditative practices are regarded as worthless (and eventually you will be ‚Äúencouraged‚Äù to get rid of any connections to your former beliefs.)  Contrary to rhetoric, relationships with perplexed friends and family may also need to be sacrificed in the wake of following unending guidance (control) in pursuit of becoming a perfect SGI member or leader and devotee of Ikeda.

Let this be a clarion call to na√Øve marks and unsusecting potential victims tempted to listen and accept at face value the outlandish propaganda spewed out by the SGI that serves to establish their leader as the supreme practitioner of all Buddhism and every SGI members' ultimate mentor (master).  Advancing in one‚Äôs Buddhist practice cannot be so easily accomplished by unquestioningly following the guidance of a Jesus-perfect mystical leader (he magically knows when your chanting is sincere or your ichinen is pure) or a self-praising organization that declares ""we have the ONLY way to happiness for EVERYONE‚Äù (because you know - all others will fall into hell and have their heads broken into seven pieces unless they practice exactly as the SGI dictates).  The SGI misses the Buddhist mark completely with the adoration, veneration, and deification of Ikeda.  What has always been essential in Buddhism is to doubt everything, and to then discover and to follow one's own true path ‚Äì precisely the opposite of blind acceptance of a slickly packaged religious faith that dangles the proverbial carrot before hungry eyes.       

Ikeda is no Buddha. Not by any means. Ikeda's carefully concealed lifelong quest for power and wealth are not even remotely consistent with the aspirations or objectives of a Buddha.  Yet his extremely exaggerated importance and status as extolled by the SGI's dogmatic doctrines would have Ikeda's magnitude surpassing even that of the historical
Buddha.  The tenant regarding the extreme importance of  ‚ÄúIkeda as my master in life‚Äù has been inescapably encoded into the veiled (and sometimes not so veiled) doctrines of the SGI.  Furthermore, after a lifetime of purportedly perfect SGI practice, Ikeda has not attained Enlightenment. What then does that signify for the SGI members under his ultimate and supposedly infallible leadership and guidance toward the promise of attaining Buddhahood without fail in this lifetime?    

Since the (sales) pressure to join in but never leave can be tremendous yet subtle, it would be prudent for those interested in joining to first take a very close look at what is hidden under the SGI sheets before making any hasty decisions to get in bed together ‚Äì for all this unbridled Ikeda-ism presents an extreme case of  ‚Äúbuyer beware‚Äù!

I haven't read it, but it sounds very interesting, so I thought I would post a blurb about it here.

Commence blurb:

>For many of us who grew up in a theistic world of 'God', the idea of God becoming a Buddha may seem confusing and disorienting, as we tend to think of God as the creator of the physical universe and ""the Buddha"" as just a human being within this creation. And while it is certainly true that the historical Buddha (Siddhattha Gotama) was a human being just like us, this book examines his past lives as a God, his discourses to the Gods, and central teachings from the Dhamma he taught to shed light on the logic and nature of Buddhist Cosmology and its relationship to the path of spiritual liberation from the things that make us suffer.

>One may ask, how could a God who ruled the universe not be fully liberated spiritually, as the awe, overwhelming power, and genius of the physical universe appears beyond human comprehension, and therefore its ruler must have achieved the highest state of being. Complete mastery of the physical laws of the universe - the elusive goal of science - is widely considered the ultimate in human development. But through examining Buddhist Cosmology and the numerous discourses the historical Buddha gave on the nature of the God(s), we learn that the Gods were/are imperfect and addicted to form and/or sense gratification, and had many spiritual fetters that kept them bound to the gross and finer material realms of existence despite significant spiritual advancement.

If we do not tell the offendeer that, they very well may continue with the behavior that is angering us. Why should they stop if there are no consequences?

"Something happened to me tonight, and I don't think I'll ever be the same.","Earlier tonight, while waiting for the release of Black Ops 2, I smoked what my cousin told me was weed. It probably wasn't simply weed, because something happened to me that I can only describe as a 'bad trip', even though I've never done any hallucinogenics. My reality shattered. I still have no words that I know that will make the thoughts and feelings that I experienced for a few short minutes coherent enough to be
truly understood, but I can say a few things. First, it was terrifying. I believe that the moment in my life, at least up until now, in which
I experienced the most fear and/or anxiety was this one. I had no control over what was happening to me. Later, I would describe the initial minutes of what happened to me to my cousin as feeling like I was stuck in some kind of loop that only lasted a few seconds but seemed to go on for eons, only there was really no 'I'. I know that that sounds strange, but the closest I've come to putting one of the feelings that I had into English is that I felt as if I were all that is, and that everything was me, and that everything was that moment. I can remember it feeling like it took years for me to realize that the things that my cousin were saying to me were not the things he had just been saying to me. There was also this concept that was horrifying to me, something that for some reason makes me recall a word like brood or bluud. It was the concept that what was happening right now had never happened before, or something like that. I was in a car, so I started thinking about cars, and about why cars, and why people, and what are people...I'm not leaving out words, that is just the best feeling way to describe what I was thinking about. After I finally came down, and I say finally even though it only lasted about 5-8 minutes, I felt, and still feel, like something fundamental changed in me. I don't know how I ended up on /r/Zen, and then /r/Buddhism, but what I'm reading on here, in the sidebar..It's REALLY clicking. I just ordered the book Hardcore Zen by Brad Warner, since it was suggested for skeptics in a sidebar post. I don't know how Buddhism and Zen view recreational drug use, again, I'm VERY new to all this. I've been an athiest for years now, with no spiritual views, but this...is really making sense. The stuff I'm reading about like impermanence and interconectivity are making so much sense. I just want some advice. Where should I go from here? This feels like a huge deal for me right now. It feels like my life is changing.



(I left a LOT of detail out about my experience, but only because I have NO way of describing it without it being a disjointed incoherent word salad.)



EDIT: I don't really want to talk about the drug. I made this post primarily because I was in awe of how much this subreddit and the information on it are speaking to me in light of this experience.


Edit again: I don't feel like my interest was welcomed. I was downvoted because what led me to look into Buddhism was smoking something instead of consciously deciding, ""Well, seeing as how I've been an aspiritual athiest for years now, I ought to sit down for 20 minutes and think about the innate suffering in life."" Should it really matter HOW I was brought towards learning about the Buddhist teachings, just so long as I was at all, especially since life is constantly changing, people are always experiencing new things, and things are happening in new ways.

The key role of emotions in letting go of attachment,"This explanation relies on you knowing correctly what attachment is, so I will explain it first:

When we say someone is attached to something isn't because he carries it, but rather because he can't let it go. Making this difference is crucial. Here's an example: *A mail man carries a package which is very heavy to it's destination, when he arrives, he tries to leave it but he finds he's been glued to it, so when he leaves it on the ground he rises it up again with him, and he's very unhappy because he can't leave the package where it belongs.*

In this example, the mailman is ourselves, the package is anything we can hold: family, love, money, even our life... Everything that doesn't accompany ourselves after we die can be the package (whether you choose to believe there's somewhere to go after life or not, it's your choice). And the location is where we must leave this thing we are attached to; if it's our family, we must leave them when we have to make decisions by ourselves or when we have to create our own family, for example, if it's money, we must leave it when we are hurting ourselves and others, if it's love we must leave it when we are hurting the other person or are hurting ourselves.  Again, whatever you carry, be it money, family, love, fashion, pleasure, melancholy , anything, even things you consciously know are attachments themselves... It's ok to carry it, as long as you can leave them when you must.

I hope you understood attachment, if you have questions you might ask in comments. 

Now, if that is clear, we must understand what causes attachment to be able to let go of all attachments.

An attachment happens when we are overrun by one emotion, thus by this saturation, the other emotions seem to disappear and we seek to perpetuate this state. Actually all emotions are always there (in potential of being experienced) but since we seek to perpetuate this state we ignore the chances we have to experience them.

The next logical question would be ""why we seek to perpetuate this"". The answer is: because it's comfortable, and comfort is ego wanting to perpetuate itself as it is now. Explaining it a bit further: Since all material things face change one day or another anything (again, material) that attempts to perpetuate itself immobile (or immutable) will begin to face decay when change happens. Thus, ego must always destroy itself and rebuild itself, in this particular way (too) ego doesn't exist, since each time you look it's always something different. But ego is a whole different subject.

So, going back a few steps, the reason, or rather, the happening that causes attachment to happen is being overrun by one emotion, thus choosing to be blind to the other emotions. So, the solution of attachment would be quite simple: Seeking other emotions. But some times it's not like that so I'll explain a bit further.

We seek happiness in our lives, and particularly in buddhism like seeking to be ""white"". In what sense? We seek to be white while illusorily thinking that white is a color on it's own, we think this because we see always the result, not the process. Since white isn't made of ""white"", like blue is made of blue, which is indivisible into other colors, white is made of all the colors mixed in the same amount. By this example, happiness isn't aiming to be happy, but rather experiencing every emotion in the same amount as our choices lead us to experience them, without ever lingering in one and allowing it to overcome our will, of course unless we chose to (which in such case, it isn't overcoming our will). We usually avoid emotions like anger, sadness and anxiety, but these emotions are all part of the cycle, and we can't ignore them if we want to be happy and free.

Going back to the subject, we can't seek other emotions since now we want to preserve this emotional state and we are in samsara. We hold a problem inside us so *we must give it a solution*. All problems must be solved in our mind, or else they will haunt us.

In this there are two cases:

- If the problem can be solved, the solution is facing the problem, which will lead to experiencing the emotion further, then experiencing a new emotion.

- If it can't, which then would mean it's somebody else's problems since only the problems that are not our own can't be solved by ourselves... Then we must accept that we can't solve it, learn and simply forget about it.

In these ways we will release ourselves from the emotions and thus allow ourselves to jump to the next one, never attaching to one emotion, cycling thru all of them, thus being ""white"" or happy. I hope this was clear.

That was the long explanation, the short one is: live in the present, altho not throwing away your future.

Hope you found this useful.

How should a Buddhist fall asleep?,"The only way I can fall asleep normally is to 'turn-off' my Buddhism.  Go back to automatron and stop mindfulness, stop awareness and breathing meditation.  

I would not sleep for days if I continued to be 'fully' Buddhist.

What happens if I don't turn off is I will eventually meditate into a trance, and then into a semi lucid state, where maybe I'll fall asleep but more likely blast into an out of body experience.  This SUCKS because it is very uncomfortable.

So my question is for experienced Buddhists, on falling asleep.  Techniques / Tips much appreciated.

Is secular Buddhist identity - Thoughts,"I know we've had some discussion on the impact of secular Buddhism on Buddhist discourse a few days ago, and I'd like to take a slightly different angle of reflection: is the Secular Buddhist identity a coherent one? I would argue no through a series of reflective exercises:

**Definitions of words** ***can't work for 'everyone'***

Claiming that the term *Buddhist* needs to be inclusive (of atheists, materialists etc), is illogical, since one of the functions of a noun, is to ***delineate*** an object in the world ***from other objects/phenomena***. This makes *productive communication possible*. 

So when we say *Buddhist,* we mean a member (nominal or otherwise) of the Buddhist religion. *So we know immediately*, by the use of that term, ***we are not talking*** about: Atheists, Quakers, or Salafi Muslims or Santeria devotees etc. 

The term Buddhist, if it is to remain a ***coherent*** term, *must exclude*, those who are *not* Buddhist.

Now we know from previous threads, secular Buddhist ideologues have time and again, made their commitments to atheistic, scientistic materialism very clear: ***by their own conviction and insistence***. 

So the plea that they *also be seen* as a ""type"" of Buddhist is incoherent and schizophrenic.  

**So who is a Buddhist?** 

Well, Lord Buddha had a very [succinct answer](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an08/an08.025.kuma.html) to this: 

>""Venerable sir, in what way is one a lay follower?""  
>  
>""Mahanama, inasmuch as one has gone to the Buddha for refuge, has gone to the Dhamma for refuge, has gone to the Sangha for refuge; in that way, Mahanama, one is a lay follower.""

And today in 2022, this formula of Refuge remains part of all devotional practices, *regardless of school.* Buddhists in Myanmar, Tibet, Japan and Indonesia ***do not share*** language, culture or diet, but what they do share, is that Refuge formula (and an array of other practices and precepts).

So Buddhists *can be identified* not by (what are by now) nebulous concepts like: ""mindfulness"" or ""meditation"", but by ***their commitment*** *(nominal or otherwise)* ***to the Three Jewels/Triple Gem***.

In other words, *where you place your faith* determines if you're a Buddhist or not.

**""But no one owns the word Buddhism!""**

The issue really has nothing to do with ownership (a red herring), but with *coherence and harm*. 

Like many Buddhists have said in last weeks thread, perpetuating the idea that atheistic materialists/sceptics are Buddhists (when they say they are) has an impact on historically Buddhist communities, particularly those in settler colonial states (like the US and Australia). 

And by insisting that Buddhism is a ""non-religion"" (another outdated, nonsensical claim), *actual Buddhists can be denied their rights to religious liberty/recognition*.

So claiming you're Muslim when you're not,  (and speaking over actual Muslims) is harmful to Muslims, the same goes for Buddhists.

""**But I can call myself what I want!""**

Yes you can :) But that right *runs both ways*: based on the precedent of 2600 years, ***I also get to respond*** to claims about identity, as it pertains to my religious tradition. A wise black women once said: ""If the glove can't be worn *both ways*, the entire enterprise is a sham.""

""**But you're persecuting me!""**

The hyperbole: I find it especially delicious when secular Buddhist ideologues invoke (mistranslated) suttas to appeal to ""logic and reason"", but when Buddhists seek to test their various claims (through our established epistemologies), we've somehow set up an inquisition to ""persecute"" them. 

This is a huge red flag for me personally, since uncharacteristically for ""Buddhists"", they're pleading for their ideas ***not to be scrutinised*** (under threat of being called a zealot of course!)

\-------------

Ladies and gents, I think as the pressure continues to mount (I'll do my bit in that department) around this issue, we will see many largely abandon the unskilful use of the label *Buddhist*. More and more people are now better educated around the orientalism and fetishisation that lies at the foundations of this strange ideology.

Secular Buddhism is starting to age as badly as those old Judd Apatow movies from the 2000s. It just feels outdated, when you look at how far we've come in globalising Buddhist discourse here.",Buddhism,1665913179.0,t3_y5co8r,0.59,7
A closer look at Secular Buddhism and Cultural Appropriation,"Hi guys, so I have another article on Secular Buddhist movement. I'll share it here in its entirety for comments/discussion. Thanks!

Full article below:

As part of my series in critiquing the Secular Buddhist movement, I thought it worthwhile to take a deeper look at the phenomenon of cultural appropriation, by taking a look at how we define culture. One of the claims of the Secular Buddhist movement is that culture can be separated from ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù. Now, let‚Äôs begin by having a look at the definition of culture and cultural appropriation and see whether this particular feat is possible.

For my analysis, I‚Äôll look at two definitions of the word ‚Äúculture‚Äù as listed in the [Oxford Learners Dictionaries](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/culture_1):

Definition one states that culture is/are: *the customs and beliefs, art, way of life and social organization of a particular country or group.*

Definition four states that culture is/are: *the beliefs and attitudes about something that people in a particular group or organization share.*

For the definition of cultural appropriation, I‚Äôll be using an article from [NCCP.org](https://nccp.org/):

**Cultural Appropriation:** *‚ÄúTaking intellectual property, traditional knowledge, cultural expressions, or artifacts from someone else's culture without permission. This can include unauthorized use of another culture's dance, dress, music, language, folklore, cuisine, traditional medicine, religious symbols, etc. It's most likely to be harmful when the source community is a minority group that has been oppressed or exploited in other ways or when the object of appropriation is particularly sensitive, e.g. sacred objects.‚Äù* (Who Owns Culture? Appropriation and Authenticity in American Law; Susan Scafidi)

So we can see that: cultural appropriation refers to a phenomenon where dominant groups can change the very meanings of the cultural capital of other non-dominant groups and thereby marginalising the source community.

Now, let‚Äôs look at some claims in the FAQ section from the [Secular Buddhism website](https://secularbuddhism.org/faq/). I‚Äôve placed the entire section on appropriation here, and as you will see, problematic ideas around culture become immediately apparent, when placed alongside the Oxford Learners Dictionaries definition:

>2.We reject the appropriation of Asian/Diasporic culture/s as part of engagement with the Dhamma  
You will see many references to separating the Dhamma from specific Asian/Diasporic cultures.

Given the dictionary definition of culture, one has to wonder in what way is separation of ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù from Asian/Diasporic culture (or say any other culture) even possible? If my point is not immediately apparent, allow me to tug at this particular conceptual thread a bit more:

If definitions one and four apply to all human communities, it stands to reason that culture is an inevitable by-product of all these human communities, whether religious or secular. So then again, the question is, how is it possible that a separation of ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù is possible from culture?

For this to be possible, the following phenomenon should be scientifically observable and demonstrable:

1. That certain groups of humans are devoid of culture,
2. which puts them in a position to extract ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù from another group of humans who have a culture.

If that is the claim, then we must ask, how do these humans attain the state devoid of culture? Is there some facet of their development that renders them thus? Could it be linked their ‚Äúsecular‚Äù worldview? If so, how does the secular worldview render these humans immune to generating culture, as defined in the Oxford Learners Dictionary? Would it not make more sense to claim that ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù moves ‚Äì through the concerted effort of individuals and groups ‚Äì from one cultural context to another?

So in my view, the claim that ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù is separable from culture, is not only impossible as an ontological claim, but also obscures the implicitly religious claim: that ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù is a set of transcendent truths that exist outside of time, space and culture and that it can be extracted/mined from those who remain mired in culture.

At this point, we can see that we‚Äôve moved far from a ‚Äúsecular‚Äù worldview to an explicitly religious one. This is a particularly curious position for the Secular Buddhist movement to hold. Is Secular Buddhism even a secular movement at it‚Äôs foundation? If the claim is yes, given the claims about culture and Dhamma above, what renders it so? Surely it can‚Äôt hinge on the existence of devas and rebirth etc, since many Heritage Buddhism(s) place little to no emphasis on these phenomena.

>Unfortunately, these are often read as attacks on those cultures; it is claimed that this separation is due to an aversion to these cultures or as a preliminary step to appropriation. Truthfully, some of the confusion is our fault.

Actually, as far as I can tell, this has not been the claim at all. The claim has been, that existing Buddhist traditions have been subject to the colonial gaze, framing these traditions as a degeneration of a pure unadulterated version located in the distant past. In fact, Western, normative narratives/histories of ‚ÄúBuddhism‚Äù, are essentially those of degeneration and contamination. This is why we still see the widespread misunderstanding of Vajrayana and Mahayana Pure Land teachings as ‚Äúlater‚Äù, degenerate forms of a ‚Äúpurer‚Äù form of Buddhism.

This Western, colonial gaze continues to frame living Buddhist traditions as simply collections of moribund rituals and superstitions. And that ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù can be extracted, to be spirited off to lands where humans have no culture, to forever exist there in pristine glory, far from the mindless religious and superstitious masses.

However, many non-Asian Buddhists continue to practice Buddhism(s) in their traditional forms while applying creative innovations to reach people from other cultural milieus. This makes perfect sense, as the task in rendering ‚ÄúBuddhism‚Äù intelligible to others, will require cross-cultural understanding, religious literacy and most basic of all, that Buddhist ideas ‚Äì in this process ‚Äì are shifting/moving from one cultural context to another.

>We haven‚Äôt been able to find the right words to express ourselves. (However, we‚Äôre going to try here and now:)  
The opposite is actually true. We do not wish to appropriate these cultures with our practice of the Dhamma. For those of more European descent, this prevents a repetition of historical harms.

If this is the case, my recommendations would be the following:

1. Redress of the historical harms that have been done to heritage Buddhists,
2. acknowledging that cultural adaptation and exchange is actually what should be happening
3. Disavow ‚Äì in theory and practice ‚Äì the harmful idea that ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù can be separated from cultures

>For those of more BI/POC descent, this allows us to engage with the Dhamma without dealing more harm to our already harmed (by Imperialism) cultures (i.e. there is a responsibility to uphold our own cultures to combat harm to those cultures that the adoption of Heritage Buddhist forms can interfere with).

Once again, the same misunderstanding is repeated here. The issue for Heritage Buddhists, is not that ‚Äúpeople from one culture should not participate in the culture of another‚Äù. That position, is not only impossible, but is in fact a straw man of the phenomenon of cultural appropriation, largely perpetuated by those who refuse to intellectually engage with these issues and cast negative aspersions on Heritage Buddhists who raise concerns they deem valid.

>And for Asian/Diasporic Secular Buddhists specifically, this allows practice of forms that are not specific to their specific ethnicity without similar issues around appropriation and harm to the practitioner‚Äôs culture (i.e. a person of Thai heritage could explore elements of Zen without issues that might otherwise arise).

The example above is logically unsound, as Zen Buddhism, is very much the historical contribution of Chinese Buddhists. Chinese cultural engagement with Indic ideas, literally gave the world the basis of the Zen traditions we know today. Again, people of different cultures sharing practices is not the definition of cultural appropriation.

>This is why we seek a separation of specific cultures from the Dhamma ‚Äì to prevent appropriation and to facilitate access to the Dhamma by those of BI/POC descent (who otherwise may have to choose between the Dhamma and healing their cultures) ‚Äì and NEVER as a form of erasure.

As the reader can see above, once again, the magical claim is made regarding separating the dhamma from specific cultures.

>The Asian/Diasporic peoples who started and maintained (i.e. transmitted) Buddhist Forms for millennia, allowing for Secular Buddhism to eventually arise ‚Äì our Dhamma ancestors ‚Äì have our deep and explicit gratitude for that and always have. (And, again, part of that gratitude is making sure that we do NOT harm cultures with appropriation as part of our practice of the Dhamma.)

Here we can see a carefully crafted paragraph meant to give the reader the impression that the secular Buddhist movement is simply another school of Buddhism. I will not delve into the doctrinal issues (in this article at least) that make the above claim problematic. I will say, that from the authors point of view, the Secular Buddhist movement seems to require this association, to position themselves as legitimate heirs to the extant Buddhist traditions that have their wellspring in Asia.

The fact that a vast (and growing number) of Buddhists (regardless of heritage), by and large do not recognise them as such, should make us pause and reflect on what is actually being peddled as Buddhist Dhamma ‚Äúwithout culture‚Äù. It is the authors opinion, that **the Secular Buddhist movement is ‚ÄúBuddhist‚Äù only in so far as association with an ‚ÄúAsian religion‚Äù can add legitimacy and orientalist mystique to their particular quasi-religious movement**.

So, to some up: the claim that ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù can be separated from cultures **renders the cultural biases of those engaged in this magical process invisible**. It renders *their assumptions* of what constitutes ‚Äúthe Dhamma‚Äù and what does not, opaque. **Who** gets to decide what constitutes the ‚Äúcore‚Äù of a tradition and what cultural conditioning is at play when making these decisions?

Buddhists, heritage or not, should be willing to engage this movement with the difficult questions it repeatedly refuses to answer. Secular Buddhists continue to build institutions, invoking the name of a world religion, of which they claim to be ‚Äì simultaneously ‚Äì members and secular detractors of. This astounding position makes perfect sense if one factors in cultural appropriation, driven by materialist, scientistic, capitalist concerns and reinforced by [orientalism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Orientalism), a form of racial essentialism.

99% sure I've attained to Stream Entry AMA!,"Hi all at /r/Buddhism!

First off, I've decided to write this purely to stir things up a little - to convince people as best I can that SE is possible in this very life, and not after spending years living in Tibetan caves either! 

How I did it/my meditation history: I began meditating in late 2009, so less than 4 years ago. Back then I practised very irregularly - maybe once or twice a week IIRC. I will say that I did seem to always have quite an appetite for meditation even at such an early stage. I think I pretty much always practised in hour-long sessions, not without difficulty, but my point being there was some natural aptitude towards still-sitting, solitude and introspection. 

For over two years I devoted myself to practicing samatha, with my goal being the first jhana. It wasn't bloody easy. There were many, many disappointing sits and times where I was forced to change tack, realising that you don't just brute force your way beyond a light first jhana, which was the furthest I could get, using a forced-breathing technique (no doubt millenia-old) that I discovered. 

What really pointed me in the right direction (though I believe could easily have sent me on a years-long sort of fool's errand, based on what I've read of other people's accounts) was a ten-day Goenka retreat I did around April of last year. This left me convinced that a return to unforced breathing was the only way forward samatha-wise, and also in retrospect was when I first crossed the 'Arising and Passing Away' stage of Mahasi Sayadaw's progress of insight map. I spent that summer practising samatha two hours a day, figuring that a solid grounding in concentration practice would give me the best chance of landing Stream Entry in daily life (I was not prepared or able to drop out of normal life to do it, though of course there were many times when I wished I could). 

The effects of the 'dark night' or 'knowledges of suffering' stages also started to set in. This involved a slow, steady descent into complete anhedonia (something I'm still living with to this day), accompanied with regular low moods, apathy, strong aversion, loss of connection with emotions (though I do wonder if some of these are unrelated and simply the result of my life being unusually difficult as the latter of these also remains with me) and a general sense of everything I thought I could rely upon/cling to was crumbling apart in my hands ‚Äì a real process of purification, of being left with nothing but oblivion, and in the end wanting nothing more than to surrender to it.

The anhedonia I think played an especially important, and probably helpful, role as I think I may have being getting jhana by late summer and simply not realizing, though it could also have simply been a very strong pre-jhana ‚Äòaccess concentration‚Äô. Either way I‚Äôll take a brief detour here to explain what worked for me in finally making substantial/lasting progress in samatha:

* Incorporating mindfulness into my sits. This is enormously important. At this point I see it as one of the two key aspects of success in samatha, the other being mental stillness.
* Developing a mind ‚Äòinclined to abandoning‚Äô ‚Äì realizing that ‚Äòyou‚Äô don‚Äôt ‚Äòdo‚Äô jhana. It‚Äôs entirely a process of letting go, making less and less effort. Ideally I think the mind should be allowed to naturally sort of reset to attention on the breath, not be pulled back there. Though I‚Äôm aware that it‚Äôs also not about never doing anything. Maximum effiency for me then (post-SE it‚Äôs a whole different ballgame) involved knowing when to allow the ‚Äòdoer‚Äô to step in and make a slight tweak, say to re-establish mindfulness if it had become dulled, or change the width of attention‚Ä¶
* Finding a width of attention that worked for me. That meant focusing on the sensations that made up my head generally, and especially those of mental movement and concentration. This I think is especially powerful as a kind of positive-feedback reinforcement loop is created where the more one concentrates, the more one has to notice. It also helps sustain the benefits of the following‚Ä¶
* Taking a few seconds to objectify/see the three characteristics in sensations of my head and temporarily root-out the sense of self or centerpoint, really helping to speed up the solidification as otherwise the self can start to panic and squirm as concentration encroaches on it.

With all of these employed my early-jhana/access concentration could be really ramped up so that by Christmas I was getting super-intense mental solidification where the five hinderances were totally stamped out through the sheer brunt of concentration. Then over three days I went from a very obvious and sustainable first jhana, to the first four the day after, to all eight the day after that, albeit these were still quite light and wouldn‚Äôt qualify by Ajahn Brahm‚Äôs and a lot of people‚Äôs definitions of jhana, and five to eight may not qualify by less-strict standards either as they weren‚Äôt truly formless ‚Äì I could still sense my body, hear and think, etc. But they did clearly align with the names of ‚Äòboundless space‚Äô, ‚Äòneither perception nor yet non-perception‚Äô etc., so I do consider them valid attainments.

By January of this year the dark night was really hitting hard, or maybe my ability to endure it was wearing thin. I started ruthlessly investigating reality around then mainly out of desperation. There was no formal meditation technique involved that I‚Äôm aware of ‚Äì I couldn‚Äôt abide the idea of starting from scratch with some new technique I think (body-scanning from what I‚Äôd read wasn‚Äôt effective for getting path). So maybe once a week, usually at my lowest ebb, I would try to unravel the sense of a centerpoint. This involved:

* Pretending I was in the stage of ‚Äòequanimity regarding formations‚Äô (and indeed this often left me there) and trying to be as inclusive as I could in objectifying the sensations that made up reality for me, really hitting at the false sense of duality until all seemed to become one and the centerpoint was part of it.
* Riding the jhanic arc up to ‚Äòeighth‚Äô and residing there as long as I could, trying to attain ‚Äòhard‚Äô jhana as best I could, stewing in fourth jhana‚Ä¶ doing anything I thought would boost concentration, then beginning the investigation.
* Pretending the observer was outside looking in, pretending an arrow or bullet was being shot right through my skull, destroying my self.
* Seeing bodily sensations as not just not self, but not me at all ‚Äì more like any other object. This was an important turning point I think.

What I believe helped me get there:

* A strong (though not exceptional or anything) intuition that was always running in the background during meditation, throwing up insights.
* A thorough clobbering from the dark night until as I said I wanted nothing more than oblivion ‚Äì in other words, I was a little bit suicidal.
* Not obsessing over dissolving coarse sensations until the body was entirely vibrating particles, as Goenka would have you do, but having confidence that I was seeing the impermanence, suffering and not-self in everything anyway.
* Hanging out on forums like the DhO and Kenneth Folk dharma where attainments are discussed openly and there‚Äôs a strong message that this can be done by lay people in years, not decades.
* Having the self-knowledge to focus on concentration over dry insight, knowing that my awareness doesn‚Äôt naturally flit quickly from one thing to another, etc.
* Realising that the three characteristics apply just as completely post-SE as pre. Getting to a point where I only wanted to attain this in order to better help others. Thinking my way out of the trap of anticipation of path.

So I kept this up for about 3 months, practicing samatha daily and vipassana once or twice a week. Then, early this month, feeling thoroughly fed up with everything one night and turning to vipassana for an hour or so before going to bed, I was laying there in bed ‚Äì I say I but at this point there was no I, just a mass of atoms not anticipating or doing anything or locating themselves on any map ‚Äì when I decided to focus on bodily sensations, remembering that Goenka advised doing this while on retreat (I think?). After I believe no more than a few seconds of this, just beginning to relax after a long day, there was a sudden, bright flash of light and a discontinuity - not exactly pleasant, probably entrance through a suffering door ‚Äì followed by a shower of warm, tingling sensations through my head. No pleasure of course due to the anhedonia. 

I don‚Äôt think I jumped to conclusions but just laid there. It was anticlimactic. But very soon I started to cycle and before I went to sleep I must have completed four or five cycles through nanas 4 to 12, then 15. It did seem to be nana 16, the ‚Äòreview‚Äô stage, though I was still skeptical. The following two weeks saw the following, which left me convinced:

* Regular cycling that sped up when I stopped to pay close attention to it.
* A sudden increase in samatha skills ‚Äì I can now simply drop ‚Äì not do much of anything ‚Äì and end up in jhana. Indeed the cycling meant I was only seconds off a light jhana.
* A jump in perceptual ability ‚Äì seeing vibrations in equanimity in daily life without even trying. Easily dissolving blind areas where I struggled before.
* A transparency and increased sense of things unfolding as they always have. Just a general reduced sense of there being a self at the controls of this body.
* An increase in intelligence, or maybe just a return to my pre-dark night intelligence level, which was so long ago I‚Äôve almost forgotten what I was like then.
* Much-reduced feelings of craving and aversion towards anything.
* Much-reduced capacity to become even slightly irritated or stressed out by anything.
* ‚Ä¶in other words, a quite significant reduction in general suffering that makes it all worthwhile.
* I believe reproducible fruitions are also a sure sign, though not diagnostic. I‚Äôve found them tough, though not impossible, as all sense of self and doer needs to be completely out of the picture for them to happen.

I write these in the past tense because I‚Äôve since begun a new progress of insight for second path, so it‚Äôs all died down a bit and gotten confusing as to which nana I‚Äôm in.

Ok, so maybe I‚Äôve just answered most of the questions people would be interested in asking me. If you have any left, I‚Äôd be glad to field them!

Is cheating always BAD KARMA and wrong?,"  

Hi,

Is cheating always BAD KARMA and wrong?

I and this girl I like started getting physically intimate recently and she is in a relationship. Now this is cheating I understand. But I wanted to understand if with added context, is it still wrong or is it less wrong or something.

She has had emotionally abusive and in general bad relationships especially with one ex trying to commit suicide when she wanted to break up with him. 

About a year back she met this guy whom she liked and within a few months of meeting once a month physically\[rest of the times on phone\], the guy‚Äôs father died and he begged her to commit to the relationship because he really needs it right now and she did. Since then it has turned into this unhealthy thing of him trying to control her and tell her how she should feel, and to make her talk to his mother for long durations in which the mother \[who is a psychologist by the way\] would vent out her life‚Äôs troubles on this girl for hrs sometimes. She has difficulty saying no due to various reasons and just tries to not confront and can‚Äôt deal with her boyfriend getting angry and shouting and is v afraid that he will self harm if she ends things and doesn‚Äôt want to be the cause of that.

I know talking to her that she doesn‚Äôt want to be in the relationship but she really cant confront or take any decision right now in the midst of studies and all. She wants to be physical and close with me. But she said that she really cant end things right now. I know she doesn‚Äôt secretly talk to him or anything, she just gets scared by him and his mother and tries to talk just enough to avoid them or avoid being shouted or guilted at. My bonding with this girl is something I really cherish. I have been honest with her that this is unhealthy and she says she understand but needs time, she cant bring herself up to end things right now.

Now I am caught up in a dilemma. Should I stop being physical with her, is it wrong even with the above context? Or should I continue being close with her because we have a good bond and she is like a healing presence for me, the first one for me till date. Am I generating bad karma for myself being with this girl sexually?

I apologise in advance if this is v na√Øve and things are obvious, this is my first time being close with any girl.

Thank you for reading till now:)

Rock Bottom,"I came to Pattaya (which is the world's biggest brothel) in Thailand to enjoy the girls, but I ended up hitting rock bottom, alone in my hotel room crying. Not because I was lonely or was rejected. I had all the fun and sex I expected. Money will literally fullfil your wildest sexual fantasy ever imagined. And you will not understand what lengths mankind do to satisfy themselves.

I always refuse/try to ignore the Noble truths, because I refuse to give up what I have and what I will have. However I cannot turn a blind eyes to what I experienced next.

Yestersay, I took a cheap bar girl to my hotel, let's call her Fern, as the night progressed, we had a lot of fun together. But at the same time, I learned to know about the guys Fern slept with and how her life is being a bar girl. Eventually I understood that even though she's is 27, her mental age is like 17 and is used by men of all ages as a sex toy including me, stringed by promise of money and especially the promise of true love. For example she tells me about the guys who started out as her lover but then started beating her, but she endured in the hope of he being the one. You can literally see a life devoid of love and full of exploitations. But who would ever love a bar girl? So do I, I only wanted Fern for the holes she has. I never believe in love anyway (love often blinds people). So I gave her the money, she leave in sadness of separation and I go mongering for other beautiful prostitutes.

Fast forward to today, I spend around 700 bucks having a blast at various brothels. I had the blast of my life, I saw hundred of amazingly sexy girls stripping throughout the day. I used some prostitutes to what ever I fantasized. Most of them did not like it but do it because of financial needs. But who cares right? I know they didn't like it but I ignore what they feel anyway. In the mean time, Fern, the girl I used last night, started to posting statuses about how fucked love is which I immediately know is about me. Even thought I paid her, we had genuine fun and did really connected but I ditched her and listened to my dick like always. At last I took another girl home and used her until I no longer can and kicked her out of the hotel.

 Then the reality started sinking in. This have been in the back of my mind for the whole time but I wanted to turn a blind eye to it. I started to realize how serious the suffering of these prostitutes I used. They are mostly young girls employed by bars aimed to roll in as much money to the owner as possible. They will do whatever degrading things you wanted, if you give them money. Call me a hypocrite, but if you ask me how bad the future of these girls will be, I would say they have no future. I started to realize that these girls have hopes and dreams, just like I do. That Fern the bar girl also has hopes and dreams, she wanted to have a confidence, well off foreign guy like me (I can be quite charming to girls and manipulative as well). But the difference between me and her is, my future has a chance of success, I will be wealthy, will marry a beautiful wife, and hers has none. She will spend every single day in her life dreaming about a good husband while being used by men like me until the day she turns old and discarded by society. I don't blame her, to survive here is tough and selling your body can make you decent money.

I started crying. The great but short fun I have with these prostitutes is over, but what will remain after that? Fern is literally the result of countless exploitations, which I AM THE CREATOR OF ONE. While I was enjoying the new girl, Fern was once again grieving about a guy she connected with ditching her again, and have once again learned that it is best to not falling in love being a prostitute. 

I feel so heartless. It makes me feel sickened how I did the same thing with other girls, only using them for their bodies. I am stuck in a cycle of continuously creating sufferings while seeking for pleasures and her in an endless cycle of suffering while providing it. And the roles shall be swapped.

Why was I born with such an insane sexual desire that I have to do these kind of things? I am so conflicted. I am selfish in nature, I won't abandon my needs but at the same time, I can no longer turn a blind eye, especially to the one you have connected and choose to ignore but you can't. I tried to enjoy the girls and drink a bit to ignore the problem, but I can't.

I hope that was my lesson. That I have had enough and end that cycle. I do not want to see girls like Fern suffering anymore. And me suffering because of the unfulfillment of my desire.

I think I loved Fern, she is only an innocent girl. However, I know money is not the solution, I will not sponsor her and sends money to Thailand like many foreign men do with the hope to wife her.  I still have a few days with her and I will be gone forever. I will pay her the cheap daily price, while at the same time broaden her knowledge about what I know about the world, taking her to go do charities with me, and to the temples. I hope with this she can get out of this cycle by her own. After those days I will not be back.

I know there will be still some of my selfish motives with Fern's body. That is the conflict. But I can inspire her, even as a lover for a short time. I truly want good for her too, that I will not lie.

But im afraid do I have high hopes?
Would it create more suffering as I once again lead her on? Would it fall on deaf ears? Should I just focus on my own actions first?

"Banned from /r/Buddhism for quoting one of the mod's (Bobba Phet) malicious private messages. Some of Bobba's words: ""Fuck off asshole ignorant fuck face""
","I was recently debating (that is being generous with the nature of the discussion) one of the mods here in a thread about a shakespeare quote. 

He originally went back and deleted only the spiteful responses, but now I see he has gone back and deleted all of them. IDK if mods can see deleted comments, but I know at least one other board member (lvl_5_laser_lotus) saw some of the comments as I discussed them a bit with him (http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/y5w3x/awakening_and_psychedelic_drugs/c5topoi). Like I said there, I really was trying not to make this a big deal - I don't want Bobba Phet to feel unwelcome here. At the same time, when I see him making others feel unwelcome because they are drug users (which I am as well, and I refuse to be made to feel badly about it by anyone but myself), I just can't abide that - when someone sees he is a mod, and look at his comment karma, they may assume he is an authority on Buddhism. He is not - or at least not in any kind of Buddhist practice. His own words are all the proof one needs. 

And so when I see him disparaging people for exploring their mind with substances, I feel the need to raise the counterpoint ""Hey this guy clearly doesn't know what he's talking about, he is not practicing what he is preaching"" by quoting the private messages he sent me after our discussion on the Shakespeare quote. I don't want him banned - I just feel very strongly that he should not be a moderator. If nothing will be done about this, then I'm going to stop coming here. I know that probably doesn't mean anything to any of you, but it means something to me. There are few places in real life, much less the internet where you can have thoughtful discussion without it devolving into petty arguments. I thought this was one such place, but apparently as it sits I was wrong. 

I fully admit, that towards the end of the original thread that spawned all this, I lost my patience a bit, and made some condescending/insulting statements. But you'll just have to take my word that it is a fraction the vitriol that was being spewed at me which was being reflected in my statements. 

Which is not an excuse, but rather some context. And like I said in the thread, I'm not really ashamed of any of it, and that is why it is still there - Bobba Phet cannot say the same of his comments. 

Anyways here is the full exchange of private messages which took place, the posting of which prompted my being banned. (posting in first comment reply because it's too long)


Hopefully it will result in something other than this account being banned. If you have any questions feel free to message me at my main account - sh3rog. Unfortunately I cannot post here under that identity.

It's a good thing identity is meaningless

**EDIT**

So bobbaphet (or another mod IDK honestly the mods seem to be in collusion a bit in my opinion, given that Bobba had to notify them about my banning)

""Check the Sidebar"" has to be the laziest, BS answer anyone can give when somebody comes here, asking questions about Buddhism.

to me, ""Check the Sidebar"" says that the commenter does not give enough of a shit to provide an actual answer. It indicates nothing, it says nothing. 

When somebody asks you for advice within your realm of knowledge, do you say: ""I don't care enough to answer, ask somebody else""? When somebody needs help from you , do you tell them that you don't care enough to share your own experience?

THAT's what I see when ""Check the Sidebar"" comes up. Instead of a column of resources that we could pick out in order to answer a question, it has become a crutch that further breaks our legs. I am not advocating that we remove it, but I do not believe that it exists so that people don't have to think about their answers.

When any Lama, Roshi, or what-have-you gives a Dharma talk, they're not just reciting some party lines, or beleaguering a go-to sutra, they are necessarily sharing their experience, and that's all they can do. Otherwise they may as well all say ""Check the Sidebar"" and wash their hands of helping anybody. 

All this talk about compassion and it seems that some don't care enough to give a response a full ten minutes of their time and effort. I don't care if you hate what I'm saying, as long it gets stuck in your head, and forces you to reflect before vomiting out that same tired crap.

"""Is Buddhism against Birth Control?"" (Master Sheng-yen, ""Orthodox Chinese Buddhism"" 3.23)","*3.23 Is Buddhism against Birth Control?*

This issue has yet to be discussed widely in Buddhist circles. In accordance with the basic principles of Buddhism, as long as one does not break the precept against killing a person by having an abortion, there is no reason to oppose birth control. Birth control is moral if it is done to improve the children‚Äôs quality of life and education, or to avoid financial burden.

Abortion is strictly forbidden in Buddhism and is considered equivalent to killing a human being. It does not matter whether the aborted fetus has developed recognizably human features or not; any abortion is the same as killing a person. So Buddhism is opposed to birth control through abortion.

So we need to investigate the various techniques of birth control.

MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhists believe that the intermediate-state body (*zhongyin shen*) (the spirit-body in the stage of existence between death and rebirth) enters into the mother‚Äôs womb while its parents are copulating. Seeing its future parents united, the spirit becomes deluded; if it feels passion for the father, it enters the womb to become a female, and if it feels passion for the mother, it will become a male. It also clings to the father‚Äôs ejaculated sperm and the mother‚Äôs ovum as its ‚Äúself.‚Äù But as we can deduce from embryology, this concept of self should not arise until the ovum is actually fertilized‚Äîthat is, at conception‚Äîwhich does not necessarily occur while the parents are copulating. And this account cannot explain how artificial insemination occurs. So this traditional view must be an explanation that was expedient under certain circumstances.

It follows then, if one wishes to use birth control, it should be done before the sperm fertilizes the ovum in order to avoid abortion, which constitutes killing. It may be moral if prior to sexual intercourse one takes anti-pregnancy pills or installs anti-pregnancy devices and/or medication inside the uterus or vagina. Such treatments will prevent the sperm from reaching the ovum or cause the sperm and eggs to lose their potency. But one must be absolutely sure that one is not killing the fertilized ovum. Otherwise, it‚Äôs best not to use birth control at all, and to instead use the method that Buddhism praises most highly‚Äîto practice sexual restraint.

Meditation and Ableism?,"I'm a very big advocate for disability and I have been practicing Buddhism in the Hu√°y√°n tradition for about three years now.

Recently I've been having second thoughts on meditation as a vessel of enlightenment. As disability studies informs us, not all minds are neurotypical, which is to say that all individuals experience phenomena differently. I have heard a few concerns from autistic individuals about the inability of certain neurologies to meditate (in the traditional practice) and it makes a lot of sense to me that the primacy on particular forms of meditation may be exclusionary of non-neurotypical individuals.

A contradiction I've found in Buddhist teachings,"I've been discovering philosophy and different religious traditions for myself for a while. And of course I could not pay no attention to Buddhism. But unfortunately, I've found a contradiction in Buddhist teachings. If one supposes that at least once a while someone reaches the enlightenment then eventually the whole world will do. But according to Buddhism the world is eternal, it passes through loads of cycles. Thus it should not exist now! It's like water passing from one place to another, eventually all the water will be spent. But if from any point the time which has passed is eternity, then from any point the water must not be in the first place. Then we should admit one of those: 1. The world is not eternal. 2. The enlightenment and nirvana are not ultimate and the person having reached it may be returned back to samsara. Well, perhaps it's a false dilemma and other options how to avoid contradiction exist, but I can't think of any.

Is it possible for women to achieve anuttara-samyak-sambodhi?,"
TLDR: is it possible for women to achieve the same feat as Gautama Buddha, anuttara-samyak-sambodhi?

In the 12th chapter of the Lotus Sutra, Longn√º the dragon girl attains enlightenment, but only after first transforming into a man. I'm not sure if she attained anuttara-samyak-sambodhi or another form of enlightenment, but either way she did so in the form of a man.

Many nuns in the Pali Canon achieved enlightenment, but unless I'm mistaken they all became arahants, or ""sravakabuddhas,"" rather than samyaksambuddhas like the Buddha Gautama.

In modern times, the Kagyu nun Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo ""made a vow to attain enlightenment in the female form, no matter how many lifetimes it takes."" Assuming that the enlightenment she is referring to is anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, will it be possible for her to fulfill her vow?

I feel like a lot of people say ""all enlightenment is the same,"" which may be true but seems a little off-topic. The intention with this answer I think is to say there is no difference between a man achieving anuttara-samyak-sambodhi and a woman achieving sravakabodhi or pratyekabodhi, but my question is whether a woman can achieve anuttara-samyak-sambodhi like Gautama Buddha did? This answer might also be an oblique way of saying that in fact women cannot achieve anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, but that it's no big deal because the other two are just as good.

If the answer is no, why not?
If the answer is yes, who is a woman who has achieved it?",Buddhism,1701713281.0,t3_18aq4zg,0.47,0

"Hindus and Buddhists view on each other's spirituality, and thoughts about Jesus","Hello,

I was wondering how Hindus and Buddhists (from all sects or denominations) view each other and each other's spirituality and religiosity. Your religions and world views amongst other Asian religions are somehow interconnected, and I'm really curious how they are viewed amongst you as followers.

I'm asking this since I'm taking a broad interest in Asian religions, and I am myself open to the thought of rebirth, karma and meditation. I spend a lot of time reading literature from gurus and about Buddha. I am learning how to meditate, albeit still at the beginning and it's taking time.

You might wonder what tradition I come from, and I come from an Eastern Christian tradition, and I regard and love Jesus Christ highly as an awakened person and a godly messenger. I guess he might be easy to revere from Buddhist and Hindu perspectives? I believe Christians with their religious practice have misunderstood him and his message. I find myself seeing him through new eyes. I would also like to hear common views about that.

Questions I didn‚Äôt get real answer about Buddhism,"Hello all. 
I tried asking these questions in various forums. But usually I was copped out. 
I hope someone who is not a blind fanatic can help me:
1) how far can you be kind? If you are kind to people that harm you or your kin, isn‚Äôt that not right action? On the other hand there was some ruthless killings in mynmar. Which I assume related to defending the Buddhist religion against annexation. 
Also, narcissistic people can take advantage of kind people. And not care or ‚Äúconvert‚Äù to be kind as well. 
I‚Äôm sure all of us had that kind of behaviour upon us, and it‚Äôs very challenging to me how to approach it, as I want to be kind, but I also know it won‚Äôt do him good. Or me. Like a spoiled child that needs educating. If you‚Äôll only care without borders you will get cruel behaviour from him/her. 

2) regarding reaching the highest state of non- rebirth. (The stage where you gained stream entry and you won‚Äôt be reborn again) 
That sounds to me, from what I‚Äôve read, and heard from
Various monks, practitioners is that the current existence isn‚Äôt the ultimate one. 
And here‚Äôs what puzzles me. If you actually reached a stage where nothing harms you mentally, what kind of suffering would you endure? Only physical. But you won‚Äôt suffer really. So what does it matter? Why do you think non rebirth is the best? 
It‚Äôs either nihilistic. Or there‚Äôs something I don‚Äôt understand. From what I know about life in my 48 years of experience, is that resilience is needed, and flexibility, to suffer less. And to absorb more and enjoy life by just existing. Which I found such a huge discovery when I start with Buddhism.",Buddhism,1683045434.0,t3_135t2sh,0.54,1

I'm interested in the more widespread Buddhist beliefs on abortion,"Hello friends, I am a secular Buddhist who has come to my own understanding of the intersection of Buddhism and the modern world. One thing that I am interested in discussing is the topic of abortion.

Tenzin Gyatso has said that he supports abortion in cases which birth would either kill the mother or result in a deformed/""retarded"" child. (I don't know the direct translation of his words, though I'm sure the word he used could mean either or both)

I personally disagree with his thoughts on the child, specifically in the act of denying someone existence solely because they would be born extremely neurodivergent or deformed. I understand what he means and I think that if the child will undoubtedly face a rate of suffering much more than normal that abortion would be considered sparing it then it could very much be used.

As well, I am of the belief that there should be measures taken to hopefully prevent women and trans men from undergoing abortions (such as financial aid, therapy, healthcare), but ultimately it should entirely be the choice of the pregnant person in question. In other words, I'm very strictly pro-choice as long as that choice is well-informed.

Rethinking about secular Buddhism and the ability to attain to stream entry,"I had been asking in r/streamentry about if a stream enterer there believe in rebirth before and after attainment, and it seems that the answer is agnostic.

The lay stream enterers whom I can interact with seems like imply that there is no need for belief in rebirth to attain to stream entry. The view which is purified is no self view, not neccesarily no rebirth stuffs.

If secular Buddhists can attain to stream entry, is there a big reason to blast secular Buddhism?

Yes, we can still say that some of them who wishes to rewrite buddhism is wrong view, but any tradition of Buddhism who has enlightened ones might be dangerous if one disrespect them.

Pali Canon: Samsara is not nirvana. Nirvana is a distinct element of reality, Samsara (earth, water, fire, air, space, life, consciousness etc.) are the conditioned and nirvana is the unconditioned, but it exists and exists separately just like anything else. The perception of the nirvana element is the realization of nirvana, a definite state of consciousness is associated with the perception of nirvana (not unlike eye-consciousness or ear-consciousness arises when colors or sounds are perceived, there is nirvana-consciousness when nirvana is perceived).

"""Dark"" Buddhism","**OP edit: dayum, considering this is a Buddhist forum there's some hardcore judgment and downvoting going on. Good job.**

Trying my hardest not to sound like an edgelord here.

So what I've noticed in my ""practice"" (not a normal morality-focused eightfold-path following one) is that there comes a point (years down the line) when the facts of unsatisfactoriness, Impermanence and no-self doctrines are so deeply ingrained in you and felt in your everyday life that psychologically it could be called depersonalisation.

I'm chasing pleasures of all kind (sex, drugs) and observe my desires being quenched and leaving me empty inside immediately afterwards.

I see constant change, flux and impermanence everywhere. This I think is the biggest truth of Buddhism. I realise how attachment to anything is ultimately futile and the only things I attach to are endeavours of pleasure, kinda going along for the ride (can be as innocent as being focused on a TV show until I binge it). Can't attach to people, wouldn't want to anyway, I see most people (and all other animals for that matter), as inherently selfish, temporary bundles of flesh and bone with a disgusting-looking organ in the driver seat.

Don't consider myself an exception in the least.
I also know that our personalities are made up of a constant flow of different emotions and thoughts, utterly meaningless.

Death is final and there is no reincarnation, just as there is no heaven with Jesus or Allah in it. I only believe what I observe and see about life as the Buddha intended.

Now this obviously does free me from a lot of suffering when I let go of attachments. It also, obviously, makes it extremely hard for me to connect with other people and even be emphatetic instead of utterly selfish.

Goodness is only a coping mechanism for inevitable death.,"I've been contemplating my own mortality and the meaninglessness of it all for the last few days. I have especially been curious about how Buddhism seems to avoid this issue and what differentiates it from Existential Nihilism.

Then I found this comment in a zen thread by a deleted account from a year ago:

""When you live for happiness, you fear death. When you live for goodness, you don't need to. Death is an enemy to happiness, but not really an enemy to goodness. I know that's vague but that's the direction I'd point you to, and is probably the extent of my wisdom on the topic!""

From [https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/82x9mb/zen\_and\_the\_fear\_of\_death/](https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/82x9mb/zen_and_the_fear_of_death/)

This brought me to two realizations:

\- living life for your own happiness, whether through pleasures, relationships or accomplishments, is ultimately unsustainable and brings only suffering

\- when you shift the focus from your own happiness to another person, a goal or even the worship of a god or an ideal (such as goodness), it is nothing but a psychological coping mechanism that allows you to reconcile your getting up in the morning with the futility of your impermanent existence.

The original zen/chan masters seem to disregard both theravada and mahayana Buddhism as lesser vehicles, in fact they throw out both good and evil as merely conceptual thought and for them, realizing the unborn Buddha mind equals killing the Buddha and ordinary mind being the Way.

"Karma, Dharma, and Acts of Compassion 101","If you are interested in Buddhism, or any Eastern philosophy/religion for that matter, here are some basics you should know and/or teach.

Karma is a Sanskrit word, and just like any other Sanskrit word it has dozens of definitions. But one of the more practical ones is ‚Äúaction‚Äù. 

On a grander scale it refers to the cosmic law of cause and effect, action and re-action. Everything that occurs on any level in the universe percolates through the mysterious fabric of reality to create a change that must eventually resolve somehow to maintain equanimity. That‚Äôs nice to know and all, but for all intents and purposes it‚Äôs just theory. How does that apply to you personally? 

On a smaller and uniquely individual scale there are three basic types of karma to keep in mind. The first is a sort of ‚Äúprenatal‚Äù karma - this is what brought you to the precise time, place, and circumstances in which you were born on earth. The second is ‚Äúactive‚Äù karma - this is everything that is currently happening to you based on your actions since you were born. And the last type of karma is a little tricky - it is a sort of combination of the first two  and can be thought of as ‚Äúdestiny‚Äù karma, this is karma that will manifest at some point in the future. The trippy part of this one is that it can be altered based on your understanding and eventual manipulation of the law, which is where dharma comes into play.

Dharma, another Sanskrit word with dozens of meanings, essentially means ‚Äúduty‚Äù. Karma and dharma go hand in hand. It is because of karma you are here (again), and it is your duty to understand how to free yourself from subsequent misery-making incarnations. One of the most effective ways to do so is by realizing the true nature of the ‚ÄúSelf‚Äù by sincerely practicing a meditation technique similar to the one taught by Lord Gautama (pranayama and breath control are good places to start). Proper meditation will either help you ride the waves of karma with more ease as they come and eventually cease, or it will ‚Äúroast‚Äù the seeds of karma completely.

And once you master these principles, it is also nice to know the main types of compassionate, or ‚Äúliberating‚Äù, acts that will also help balance the karmic scales in your favor, until you reach the goal of caring about karma no more. In this world of ‚Äúsuffering‚Äù, having inner compassion for others is fine. Doing something about it is better. One can alleviate the suffering of another by three ways (in order of increasing utility) - material, mental, or spiritual. For example, you could give someone money, shelter, clothes, or food - this would help, but wealth such as this depletes. Or you might teach someone a physical skill or a mental tool to help him get along easier in this world. But, most importantly, you could also find ways to give someone lasting peace, such as teaching him how to meditate to the best of your ability or showing him where to learn. This is true spiritual wealth, and it is the kind of wealth that multiplies exponentially as it is passed on. 

The world can never have too much good karma, so let us continue creating it.",Buddhism,1496886228.0,t3_6fxxx4,0.5,0
Have I reached enlightenment?,"Six or so months ago, I was lying in bed on my own late at night. I usually think about various things late at night.

"I think certain drugs (dissociatives) have the potential to Enlighten or liberate you. I've seen the Supreme Self and the Absolute. I've seen the universe/Samsara from ""outside"". These experiences are just as valid as meditative ones. Right?","Different paths to the same place, I feel. 

Last night, I had an M-Hole that felt so spiritual and divine. I had an out of body experience, my ego was nowhere to be found. I was dissociated from my ""self"" and all that was left was pure consciousness and awareness.

Nirvana was perceived as a paradoxical truth about existence and non-existence. Existence is eternal and has always been here and will always be here. Things might go into and out of existence, but existence itself is always there. It makes you question, how is it that something has always been yet never came into being? You also wonder, instead of this reality we experience, why wasn't it just non-existence of all things forever? We know that has never been the case, because if reality never existed and there ""was"" nothingness for eternity... then we wouldn't even be here to question it.

The tricky and paradoxical part is that within existence, there can be non-existence. There can be non-experience. So in a way, even though there was always something here and it was never just eternal nothingness (which has never existed, can't exist by definition) the concept of nothingness has also always existed (within existence, paradoxically). 

The mind realizes that there was always a nothingness and  emptiness that it could attain. Liberation from itself.  It's difficult to express in language, that's why you get statements like ""neither perception nor non-perception."" It's possible for the Mind to detach from experience and be in a state that is neither experience nor non-experience. Nothing coming, nothing going.  

At least, that's how I see things at the moment... it's extremely difficult to express these understandings, words really don't do them justice.

MDMA and enlightenment,"This may just be downvoted into invisibility due to the general anti-drug sentiment in this sub-reddit, but I'll give it a shot.

-----------------------------

Does anyone else think that the MDMA/ecstasy experience is very close to nirvana? For those of us that have never done ecstasy before, let me clear something up: MDMA is *not* rolling around on the ground laughing, as it is portrayed in the media. The main effects are endless happiness, empathy, love, and peace.

When I take MDMA, I have unlimited feelings of peace and love towards all people. I don't act like an idiot like you've seen in movies. I feel as if something has been unlocked inside of me and it's finally spilling out like it always should. Sometimes I will just yell out things like, ""I love all of you! Peace to everyone! I now declare the world a happy place!"" This makes everyone around me happier too, even if they're not rolling.

I know a lot of you have negative reactions once people on here start talking about drugs. I don't think that the Buddha was experiencing an acid/mushroom trip for his whole life. I do feel like what he had was similar to what I experience when I take ecstasy. 

I'm not saying that we should all take ecstasy all the time instead of practicing. However, if you've always wondered what enlightenment is like and what you may be in for if you do awaken, you may want to try out MDMA or its siblings.",Buddhism,1342455259.0,t3_wndji,0.5,0

"Dharma Master Hengyun answers questions about abortion (3/3): ""Should a doctors perform abortions?""","**Question: My relative is an OB/GYN. If a pregnant woman has financial difficulties or already has too many children, is it okay for the doctor to perform the requested abortion?**

Answer:

...

A woman once brought her husband, an OB/GYN, to the temple. He had been diagnosed with cancer and hoped that the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas could help him. He told me that he took good care of his body and exercised everyday to maintain his health. Therefore he had no idea why he still got cancer. Actually, with abortions being so prevalent nowadays, OB/GYNs especially need to be careful. A doctor‚Äôs duty is to save lives, and performing abortions is contrary to this duty. Whatever causes we plant, we reap the corresponding effects. Karma results from our daily actions, while we create a cause only once in a while. Let me give you an example to illustrate these concepts. If we plant seeds in the spring, we need to wait until autumn for the harvests. 

The Brahma Net Sutra‚Äôs Bodhisattva precepts state that ‚ÄúA disciple of the Buddha must not kill by himself, tell others to kill, kill with expedient means, praise killing, or condone killing. He must not use any methods whatsoever, not even mantras, to kill. He must not create any causes for killing, effects of killing, methods of killing, and karma of killing. As long as the being has a life, he must not end its life intentionally.‚Äù ‚ÄúTo kill by oneself‚Äù means not only to take other‚Äôs life, but also to take one‚Äôs own life. ‚ÄúTelling others to kill‚Äù includes advising others to kill or sending someone to kill on your behalf. Whether the act of killing is done by your own hands or by others‚Äô hands because you told them to do so, the offense is the same.

...

During the 1980s, a manager came all the way from Southeast Asia to visit the Venerable Master at CTTB. This man had cancer and hoped the Venerable Master could save him. . .The Venerable Master further asked, ‚ÄúHow about your wife?‚Äù In surprise, the manager answered, ‚ÄúOh, I remember now. I once talked my wife into getting an abortion!‚Äù All the lives he had taken were coming to him and demanding payments. Therefore, if someone asks you whether she should get an abortion, you should advise her against it. Don‚Äôt say things such as, ‚ÄúIf you are in a difficult situation, just get rid of the fetus.‚Äù If you tell someone to get an abortion, it is considered as telling others to kill.

Upholding the precepts creates merit and virtue; breaking the precepts creates negative karma. However, causes and effects exist regardless of whether one has received the precepts. By killing a fetus, one will bear the consequences. I once saw rebirth plaques made by a mother who tried to cross over more than ten fetuses that she had aborted. It was frightening to realize how many lives she was indebted to! Our current ignorance creates a future full of ignorance, and a future full of ignorance causes us to be even more ignorant, thus creating a snowball effect.

I remember being an animal. How is this possible?,"I was a house cat. I still remember a few snippets of my previous life - I can remember the spot I liked to eat, a small glimpse of my owner, and the moment I died. When I became a human, I was close to my owner - I was able to verify that my memories were legitimate. Apparently, my cat self experienced kidney problems and had to be euthanized because I was no longer able to eat. I was even able to remember some fragments of the time in between lives, although some of it has no doubt been forgotten.

The reality of the world I found myself in has led me to ask a few questions about this experience.

1. Aside from a brief few seconds as a baby, my memory started to be continuous in roughly October 1999. Back then, I realized that I couldn't remember anything other than the day I was experiencing, the brief memory as a baby, parts of my cat life, and the time ""in-between"". According to my owner, my cat body was long dead before my human self was born. With this in mind, was my mindstream always inside my human body since birth, or did I possess someone?
2. How did some of my cat memory survive? If my cat body was dead before my human body was being formed, this must mean that the cat's ability to possess memory was dead too. How could it be, then, that I have those cat memories in my head?
3. Where are the other animal -> human individuals? Early on, I questioned others about their past lives, thinking it was common at first. When I realized it was not, I read stories about people remembering past lives as other humans, but there was never one about an animal life. Am I really that alone?
4. I read that habits can influence where you end up in the next life. I very much want to try and retain some memory of my current or past life for the next one. If I think about my strongest memories moments before death, is there a better chance that those memories will survive? I don't know if my cat self was actively trying to pass memories on - maybe I just got lucky that I could remember something.",Buddhism,1593073933.0,t3_hfik4b,0.64,16
The compassion and wisdom of the herb spirit Auspicious,"Hello r/Buddhism ! Since today is 4/20 (in the U.S at least), I think it would be valuable to show our appreciation and gratitude towards herbs. The following excerpt is from chapter 1 of the Avatamsaka Sutra (The Flower Ornament Scripture). This sutra is vast and the wisdom incredible. I pray this excerpt expresses the great compassion of the Mahayana sutras in liberating all types of sentient beings.
------

Furthermore, the herb spirit Auspicious found the door of liberation observing the mentalities of all sentient beings and striving to unify them. The herb spirit Sandalwood Forest found the door of liberation embracing all sentient beings with light and causing those who see it not to waste the experience. The herb spirit Pure Light found the door of liberation able to annihilate the afflictions of all sentient beings by pure techniques. The herb spirit Universal Renown found the door of liberation able to increase the boundless ocean of good roots by means of a great reputation. The herb spirit Radiant Pores found the door of liberation hurrying to all sites of illness with the banner of great compassion. The herb spirit Darkness Destroying Purifier found the door of liberation able to cure all blind sentient beings and cause their eye of wisdom to be clear. The herb spirit Roarer found the door of liberation able to expound the verbal teaching of the Buddha explaining the different meanings of all things. The herb spirit Banner of Light Outshing the Sun found the door of liberation able to be the advisor of all sentient beings, causing all who see to produce roots of goodness. The herb spirit Seeing in All Directions found the door of liberation of the mine of pure compassion able to make living beings give rise to faith and resolve by means of appropriate techniques. The herb spirit Everywhere Emanating Majestic Light found the door of liberation causing beings to remember the Buddha, thereby eliminating their sicknesses.

At that time the herb spirit Auspicious, imbued with power from the Buddha, looked over all the herb spirits and said,

*The Buddha‚Äôs knowledge is inconceivable‚Äì*
*He knows the minds of all sentient beings,*
*And by the power of various techniques*
*Destroys their delusions and infinite pains.*

*The Great Hero‚Äôs skills cannot be measured;*
*Nothing he does is ever in vain,*
*Unfailingly causing the suffering of beings to vanish:*
*Sandalwood Forest can understand this.*

*Observe the Buddha‚Äôs teachings like so:*
*He practiced for immeasurable eons*
*And has no attachment to anything:*
*This is the entry of Pure Light.*

*A Buddha is hard to meet, in a million ages;*
*If any can see one or hear one‚Äôs name,*
*It will unfailingly bring benefit:*
*This is the understanding of Universal Renown.*

*Each of the Buddha‚Äôs hair pores*
*Emits light annulling distress,*
*Causing worldly afflictions to end:*
*This is the entry of Radiant Pores.*

*All sentient beings are blinded by ignorance,*
*With an infinite variety of miseries from deluded acts‚Äì*
*Buddha clears it all away and opens the radiance of wisdom:*
*This Darkness Breaker can see.*

*One tone of the Buddha has no limiting measure‚Äì*
*It can open up the ocean of all teachings*
*So that all who hear can comprehend:*
*This is the liberation of Great Sound.*

*See how Buddha‚Äôs knowledge is inconceivable‚Äì*
*Appearing in all realms he saves beings there,*
*Able to make those who see follow his teaching:*
*This Outshining the Sun deeply understands.*

*Buddha‚Äôs ocean of compassionate means*
*Is produced to help the world,*
*Opening the right path wide to show beings:*
*This Seeing in All Directions can comprehend.*

*Buddha emits great light all around*
*Illumining all in the ten directions,*
*Causing virtue to grow as the Buddha‚Äôs remembered:*
*This is the liberation door of Majestic Light.*

If you read this far, I hope you found the excerpt enlightening. Now to conclude by dedicating merits:

May these profound merits and virtues
Be dedicated to all sentient beings
May we eliminate all karmic obstacles
And together may we attain the state of Buddhahood.

"How Buddhism comes to Earth, how it disappears, and what you can do about it","For a while before the Buddha awakened, the Earth was devoid of Buddhism (dhamma vinaya). Without the knowledge of dhamma, beings are bound to perpetual, stressful existence. 

But then a Buddha arose, around 520 BCE, and set the wheel in motion. By giving his teachings, people lend ear, implement them, awaken to them, and teach others. This is how dhamma spreads throughout the world. 

For the sheer fact that we are on a Buddhism sub-reddit, we can give thanks to the Buddha for giving that first teaching to his four friends. From that teaching, that wheel has still been spinning. The teachings have continued to spread in all directions, and the unprecedented power of the world wide web has facilitated the teachings and their spread even greater. 

But as soon as the Buddhas body dies, the teachings start to erode and the wheel begins to slow down. This is because the Buddha is no longer around to verify the dhamma, so it is up to us and our sangha to preserve it. The dhamma, the Buddha said shortly before his death, should be our teacher and guide when he is gone. 

Many things can help facilitate the erosion of the dhammas existence on Earth. Off the top of my head they are:

    -a schism in the sangha
    -allowing women into the sangha (dhamma disappears 2x as quickly)
    -listening to other teachers and not the Tathagata

From these actions, the dhamma is pushed a bit further into disappearance from this Earth. 


So what can we do to maintain the dhamma. First of all, realizing that dhamma comes and goes as a natural cycle is healthy and rooted in right view. But that doesnt mean we cant do our part to help it be preserved and even continue to grow. The webadmin at ATI is one person I can think of who has helped spread dhamma. We do it everyday here, too. As long as its real dhamma.

Because of the scope of audience online, the disappearance or spread of dhamma can be manifold. Hopefully we contribute to the continued spread of dhamma. :)

Before the recluse Gautama, there were numerous Buddhas (28 in our aeon) who awakened and there will be numerous Buddhas in the future who awaken to the truth on their own. 

But right now, 2014, we are still experiencing and learning from the teachings in what we hope to be their preserved form. And this is why putting the teachings into practice is so important. This is how the dhamma becomes a living thing within everything. 

Try and facilitate the spread of true dhamma, and not its disappearance. 

-----------
**The Buddha explains how Dhamma disappears from the Earth**

Staying at Savatthi. ""Monks, there once was a time when the Dasarahas had a large drum called 'Summoner.' Whenever Summoner was split, the Dasarahas inserted another peg in it, until the time came when Summoner's original wooden body had disappeared and only a conglomeration of pegs remained. 

""In the same way, in the course of the future there will be monks who won't listen when discourses that are words of the Tathagata ‚Äî deep, deep in their meaning, transcendent, connected with emptiness ‚Äî are being recited. They won't lend ear, won't set their hearts on knowing them, won't regard these teachings as worth grasping or mastering. But they will listen when discourses that are literary works ‚Äî the works of poets, elegant in sound, elegant in rhetoric, the work of outsiders, words of disciples ‚Äî are recited. They will lend ear and set their hearts on knowing them. They will regard these teachings as worth grasping & mastering.

""In this way the disappearance of the discourses that are words of the Tathagata ‚Äî deep, deep in their meaning, transcendent, connected with emptiness ‚Äî will come about.

""Thus you should train yourselves: 'We will listen when discourses that are words of the Tathagata ‚Äî deep, deep in their meaning, transcendent, connected with emptiness ‚Äî are being recited. We will lend ear, will set our hearts on knowing them, will regard these teachings as worth grasping & mastering.' That's how you should train yourselves.""

"How Aqua's song ""Barbie Girl"" relates to Buddhism (long)","Sometimes when I'm in the middle of some sort of process like driving or showering, I'll randomly start singing a piece of a song. I'll only sing a line or two, but inevitably, whatever I sang will prove itself to be a sort of signal for where my mind is at. It's like my subconscious wants to make a musical connection to whatever is going on. Today, I found myself singing a piece of the song ""Barbie Girl"" by Aqua. Which part?


""Imagination, life is your creation.""


It got me thinking about how the funny part of doing away with attachments and aversions, or living in the past or future, was that those things are all imaginary. It's like somewhere along the way I was told ""The imagination isn't for making friends unless you're a kid! If you're an adult, it's for reminding yourself of your past failings and future doom!"" hahaha. 


But the imagination is just the tool of the mind to create some something. Some concept, symbol, stuff like that. Essentially through my years of Buddhisting, I've learned the hardest lesson is simply making the mind a friend. At first, it felt like someone I didn't want to hang out with at all. Why would I? All it ever talked about was terrible things, and it looked down on everyone else for every reason it could muster unless they had something to offer me. What a jerk, right? That was my imagination. Now, I realize that imagination is just as much a part of me as anything else, and it deserves equal amounts of love and most importantly, space to grow. You can't just duct tape an annoying person's mouth, or run away from them or whathaveyou and expect that person to be any different the next time they make contact. You have to let them know that they are capable of infinitely different things, and that includes seeing the world in infinitely different ways. Sure, that friend might struggle, and the growing pains may feel hard to bare. But then, it's all imaginary anyways. 


I've learned that meditation can be a tool for me to run away, or a tool for me to explore and befriend. Either way, nothing is really happening. It's all in my imagination, but meditation helps me relax my imaginary concept of what kind of person I'm supposed to be, and with what mindset. The present moment is what I contrast that imagination with. The present is reality. My breath, my room, my bed, my a/c, my senses, my awareness of everything, that's the reality. 


If I take one more step back I can see that even that present moment is imaginary. It's all empty, and selfless. Nice work, 4 seals of Buddhism. And to contaminate that present with my imaginary b.s. attachment and aversions will never lead anywhere. That's like playing hide-and-go-seek with an imaginary friend and expecting to win in a real way of actually seeing them with my eyes, haha. 


So if my imagination creates all of this, and I can create whatever I want, what kind of world do I want to create?


Imagination. Life is your creation.

The White Privilege of Zen Buddhism?,"If there is no concrete self to be found and if we, before a single though occurs are all essentially perfect and the same. If we are to put down opinions of good and bad, like and dislike to just perceive a situation clearly, treat all beings as our self.... Where does the white privilege of the Buddha dwell and where is the white privileged of east asian Zen masters?

I tried to give the simple advice to a family member distraught by thinking about race and thinking about the thinking they were having to put it all down and just look at what is before in every situation. I tried to say that we are all one race despite and that we should just moment by moment respond compassionately with a clear mind and that if we all can do that that is how we end racism and war. But I was just told that such a view was itself racist and was a product of my white privilege. 

If this practice and philosophy is extends back 2500 years to India and also over a thousand years to east Asia how can I be founded on white privilege and how can one show someone that they are just perpetuating suffering by clinging to ideas?
