How to Deal With a Mothers Concerns,"Hey fellow Stoics,

Just wanted to share a common struggle many of us might face – dealing with a parent who's overly concerned about our life and relationships. It can get quite annoying. How do you guys maintain your stoic principles in such situations? How do you keep your cool among well-intentioned but sometimes overwhelming concern?",Stoicism,1706285302.0,t3_1abluhw,0.75,2
Does perception affect the outcome in your opinion ?,"For example, if i am facing hardship right now that i have never faced before.

Does believing that i will eventually get out of this state and be back stronger actually affect the final state i will be in or does it not matter.

Accounting for the fact that the action that will be taken and the circumstance are a constant.

Will time do the trick regardless or does faith play a role ?",Stoicism,1706284591.0,t3_1abljwa,0.87,6
Habits to develop courage,Hello I feel like I’m lacking in courage. And as a man I think it is an essential character trait. I have felt how liberating it is to be courageous.

Feeling unappreciated and disrespected,"Been reading/listening about Stoicism recently and would like know what Stoicism says about my situation which is as follows:

I have been with my company for very long time and just got a new role/ promotion 
within the company after a long time trying. During the transition with the new employee, I have noticed an utter lack of gratitude from my previous group and this new person. My social skills aren’t great but I am always very nice to my coworkers and tend to have a “people pleaser” quality. 
Feel little hurt that my work isn’t appreciated.  I know these are old coworkers but still feel disappointed after one spent so much time in a role.
The other thing, I have noticed people junior than me have gotten higher roles which has created an inferiority complex in me.
So both of those things seems to be bothering me a lot and causing stress.
Any suggestions on what Stocism says around that would be helpful….

I would like to quit this company but the job market in my industry isn’t very well.",Stoicism,1706272504.0,t3_1abhbx3,0.9,8
Maintaining Confidence in One's Beliefs and Opinions Despite Disagreement from the Majority,"There were a couple of [studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments) done in the 1950s that looked at the influence of other people's opinions/beliefs on an individual's perception. These studies had a group of people view series of lines and determine which was the longest in each case. However, only one member of the group was actually a participant; the rest were actors. While the actors chose the correct lines in the beginning, over time they began, as a group, to select obviously incorrect lines as the longest. This had a marked influence on what the participant chose, and, despite many times having misgivings about the answer, ended up conforming in most cases.

I've noticed in my life that there are numerous opinions that I'm well read upon that most people disagree with reflexively. My opinions are controversial and I'm sure most of you here would disagree with me as well. However, I'm a logical individual and I try to learn about the reasoning of the disagreements through discussion and debate. Often times, however, I'm told I'm a bad person for having my beliefs, but I've not heard very substantive reasons that I'm mistaken: they're mostly value-based. I remain unconvinced.

At the same time, however, I can't help but always have doubt in my heart because so many people disagree with me. In fact, the more often, I hear I'm wrong, I'm more and more affected, even without a logical reason.

Rudyard Kipling says regarding being a man, ""If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, But make allowance for their doubting too"". I believe this fully. As a stoic, how does one balance trusting in his or her own beliefs while taking into account the input of others, even when they view you as a bad person for those beliefs?",Stoicism,1706272408.0,t3_1abhayh,0.71,4
Yesterday I used the stoic advice for the first time efficiently after losing my wallet.,"So I took a bus home yesterday.

I left my wallet on the seat next to me. 

I was reading something on my phone about atomic bombs and I was very interested about it, so I didn’t do the lifesaver check I normally do on the area I’ve been before leave, so when I got home, where’s my wallet?

Back from work, tired, hungry, I started feeling like the rage and anger were increasing within myself.


“feck, it is not anywhere, I’m quite sure I forgot it on the bus, FECK, There’s always something new isn’t there? OF COURSE, how amazing of me, F*CK, I didn’t pay attention NOW I’m paying for this” 

All this dialogue going on in my head while I was brutally in a way throwing my blankets far away in the hopes I’d still find it somewhere in my room.

I was hungry but then I wasn’t anymore, like, how can I enjoy a fecking meal now?

At some stage I gave up, I froze my credit cards through the apps.

All of a sudden, however, this realization strikes me:

WAIT, I can’t control what happened, but I can control how I’m going to express my emotions after acknowledging whatever is happening on the surface.

So, magically I could gradually calm myself down, and for the first time I could actually use the stoic advice.

We only know if we really absorbed the philosophies when we face hard times.

Suddenly I was able to adopt a stoic posture in relation to what happened.

I thought logically that it wouldn’t be worth to ruminate about the whole “what-is-the-outcome”. 
Instead, I faced the possible reality of the facts and accepted it.

“I’ll call the bus station tomorrow, if they didn’t find anything, I’ll do all my documents once again, and that is it” 

I was filled with calmness once again.
I ate some food and the thought that would before become some kind of obsessive thinking barely went through my mind last night.

It was also interesting to see from time to time my mind trying to function in the “old” way. 
So I was reading something on my laptop and my mind randomly goes “My wallet, bro I lost my wallet, F*ck” and seconds later I’d also hear the thoughts “saying” “haven’t we talked about this already?” The end.

I lost things before because I used to be very forgetful.
This kind triggers something in me.
But THIS time it felt like I was in control after a LONGGG time.

It felt like there was a catalogue of emotions, and I picked one that made me feel “You don’t control what happened, but you control how you respond to it”


Ps: btw, I’ve called them and they have my wallet at the bus station. Yayy",Stoicism,1706262291.0,t3_1abepd9,0.88,24
"""The slightest movement frightens him(me) out of his life.His baggage makes him(me) a coward""","I read Seneca's letter 63(someone here recommended it)about grieving a death. In the end it said, ""you lost someone you love, now find someone to love"". I took it out of context replacing ""love"" with ""trust"" and death with general rejection. By the way the title is from the letter before 63. But I struggle with trusting again after I've trusted and it has led to being rejected in one form or another. Be it in relationships or in expressing yourself freely as in being who you really are. And yes we are only entitled to our actions and not their results but a statement from Seneca like, ""he who while he gives thinks of what he will get in return deserves to be decieved"" is an oxymoron because aren't we biologically hardwired to expect a return(consciously or unconsciously) and for good reason? To be like ""a bee when the honey is stored"" or, in being virtuous to be the like the sun that shines on all people everyday without judgement regardless of what horrible things they've done is to not account for human emotions(which, let's face it is part of what makes us human). And even if I do the right rational thing, it doesn't eliminate the influences of these emotions. So baggage, what brene brown called ""armor"" for someone with trauma exists to protect me, saying to me, ""if you take off this armor, we die"", but she(Brown) would have you believe that this armor also holds us back from being everything we can be. On some level, I am a coward, regarding love for example because it involves an element of loading my unfinished business(baggage) on someone, expecting to get something from them that I didn't get in the past and ofcourse this is like setting myself up for disappointment because the only one who can fulfill such expectations is me. Meditations 6.20 concludes by saying ""we need to excuse what our sparring partners do and just keep our distance, WITHOUT SUSPICION OR HATRED"" and I ask myself..how?. Epictetus says Archilles was ruined the moment he forgot he was at Troy to fight, not the get women. But if this was preordained by the logos, how can it be considered ruin? Mark Twain wrote that we should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is in it and stop there. I am the cat he talks about. The one that sits down on a hot stove lid. He will never sit down on a hot stove lid again-and that is well, but he will also never sit down on a cold one anymore.I struggle with the past being my master instead of my teacher, because a part of me believes that only as my master can it strengthen my ""memory of the future"". It's only in moments when I'm overwhelmed by an appearance, caught up in a moment, it's only then that my past experiences become non existant and I am able to act boldly and audaciously. Perhaps that's courage?, I don't believe so because in those moments I am not being consciously vulnerable. I don't think I am capable of concious vulnerability, but perhaps ""unconscious vulnerability"" also counts as courage.",Stoicism,1706260007.0,t3_1abe6u7,1.0,3

Have any of you changed the thought of I wish or I hope something nice would happen to, this will happen? And how has it effected you.

Only time can heal what reason cannot.,"Many a times, we would have come across this situation. We know that worrying about it is fruitless for there is nothing to be done. What I've noticed if we persevere through the emotions, we forget what it is we worried about. I love how fate is fate. I love how stoicism tells us to let it be. Things run it's course.

How would a Stoic approach working in sports betting industry? (or any other gambling industry for that matter),"I'm about to start work in a new company that handles sports betting. I see the workplace as beneficial for my development with challenging problems, skilled coworkers and good benefits for me and, hopefully at some point in the future, my family. Even though I thought about the moral implications if such a job before accepting the offer, as the start date is approaching I'm starting to question it because at the end of the day it's profiting off of others suffering.

Some argumentation that I thought of is that even if betting shops didn't exist, people would still find ways to lose money due to the reasons why they would bet in the first place, it would just be replaced with something unregulated. This however just seems like a coping mechanism, so I'm curious if there is a Stoic approach that can be taken here and what would be some main guiding points for it. Any Stoics working in such environments like betting shops or casinos?",Stoicism,1706231309.0,t3_1ab5ryp,0.63,2

I’ve come to realize that some of my former friends have become insufferable and I always feel worse talking to them than before as they constantly talk about topics that make me feel uncomfortable. I wish things could go back to last year where I had a stable friend group with multiple people that cared for each other. Now I feel alone in school which has been making my time there miserable leading to greater burnout and anxiety.",Stoicism,1706223294.0,t3_19fmb1x,0.6,1
Some things you may not know about Marcus Aurelius,"I was talking today to Brian Muraresku, author of the *Immortality Key*, about Marcus Aurelius and the Eleusinian mysteries and it occurred to me that it might be worth sharing a few bits of trivia that I've learned over the years while researching my (three!) books on Marcus' life and times, especially my biography, [Marcus Aurelius: The Stoic Emperor](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300256666/marcus-aurelius/).  None of this is earth-shattering but I think they're things most people haven't heard about, which help make Marcus a more three-dimensional character, and for many people, like myself, being able to visualize the author can help them get more out of reading the *Meditations*.

1. There is a bust of Marcus Aurelius that survives today in the grounds of the temple complex at Elefsina, just outside Athens, where it once adorned the pediment of the *propylaea* or main gate leading into the temple of Demeter, used for the famous Eleusinian Mysteries.  It seems to be circled with poppy flowers, a symbol of Demeter.  We know Marcus went here around 176 CE to be initiated and presumably drank the famous kykeon, which Brian believes contained *ergot*, a hallucinogenic drug.  Marcus became a patron of Eleusis, paying to rebuild the temple after it was sacked during the First Marcomannic War, by Sarmatian raiders.
2. Some people believe we know nothing about Marcus' life when in fact we know far more about him than we do about almost any other ancient philosopher, because he was a famous emperor.  We have the *Meditations*, of course, but also three Roman histories of his reign: Cassius Dio's *Historia Romana*, the *Historia Augusta*, and Herodian's *History of the Empire from the Death of Marcus*.  There are also many fragmentary references to Marcus in other surviving texts.   
 But we also have numismatic evidence (from coins and medallions), statues, inscriptions, and other archeological evidence.  Some of you may know we have a cache of private letters between Marcus and his rhetoric tutor, Marcus Cornelius Fronto, discovered in the 19th century.    Perhaps the least well-known source of information exists in the Roman legal digests, which contain hundreds of references to Marcus' legislative activity, and which some scholars have used to try to reconstruct a picture of his political agenda.
3. In Carnuntum, in Austria, there's a huge archeological park, with an entire working reconstruction of a 2nd century Roman villa, and many ruins from around the time of Marcus Aurelius, as well as three museums.  Marcus famously mentions being stationed at the legionary fortress here, on the banks of the Danube, when he was writing the *Meditations*.  If you ever get a chance - go there!  It's an amazing location, just outside Vienna.
4. I had a chance to [interview the director of archeology](https://youtu.be/qALCMTLND0g?si=e0e_4DcyqXVTlmP4) at the park and ask him if they had discovered anything that could shed light on Marcus' life.  It's often difficult to tie in archeological finds with textual evidence - when you do that's kind of gold dust for historians!  However, they found the funeral stele at Carnuntum of a Praetorian which is dated 171 CE.  The Praetorians are the emperor's personal cohort of guards so it strongly suggests that Marcus would have been there at that point in time, which confirms the date historians have inferred from textual evidence.  He was probably writing the *Meditations* at Carnuntum in 171 CE.
5. We say Marcus became emperor in 161 CE because that's when he was given the title augustus but at this time the office of emperor doesn't really correspond with our English word, e.g., it's composed of several titles and powers, some of which can be shared, whereas others cannot, and which can be assumed at different times.  Marcus was actually granted most of the imperial powers in 147 CE, after the birth of his first child.  So for over 13 years, Marcus ruled alongside Emperor Antoninus Pius, as Caesar, imperator, husband of an Augusta, and wielding the tribunician power in the Senate.  They were notoriously only ever apart for a few days.  I would say Marcus was a *de facto* or virtual (albeit junior) co-emperor, alongside Antoninus, for many years before we normally think of him assuming power. 

If anyone is interested, maybe we could do another AMA or something in this Subreddit talking about research on Marcus Aurelius' life. ",Stoicism,1706216625.0,t3_19fjtcd,0.95,70
I am stuck. I need help," 

I am a high school student from India. I am stuck in a situation, which I think, Only stoicism could solve.

Actually I am fooling myself. I am preparing for JEE. world's second toughest exam. Now to main thing

 Whenever there is any test. I try to skip it. Not because I hadn't studied the topics, but because my performance is below my peers. The JEE system pushes  emphasis on your result and ranking. Thus making everybody, ie your fellow classmates, Your potential enemy. Recently I scored 18/100 while the average was 45/100. Now I can handle low points in my life but for 6 months, no matter how hard I try, I never score more than my peers' average.

Also, I've recently started procrastinating. To be honest, This is not procrastination. This is a fear. Actually my dad is obsessed with JEE. But since my performance has been low for a long time, He just says that I am trash. I ignored him for a few months, but now I really feel that I am trash. I am scared of examinations because of my dad's reaction. 

So, Whenever I study and I get stuck on a topic, I really feel that I am trash.

This feeling also takes away all of the fulfilment. And then, whenever I go to my doubts teacher, I feel like an imposter. I feel that I have not studied or I have not done anything meant to be done before doing the question sets. All of these sometimes leaves me hopeless and sometimes suicidal too.

 I believe Journaling can only help to a limit. 

And whenever I sit to study I feel as if it's not worth it . All of the studying is just drama. And I actually do think that I am doing drama.

Then there is another problem. Germany offers free education for people who want to immigrate to Germany for a long time. and whenever I ask whether JEE is worth it or not, a thought always comes that Germany is still my backup option. and then I waste my time dreaming about peaceful german way of doing things instead of the Indian way. (and I really hate my country's work culture) 

You could say ""focus on progress, not perfection), Well here I am. It's been 6 months and I really feel that I have achieved nothing. I gave up on dating girls just so that I could focus on studies, I also moved away from all of my friends who were not interested in studies, Just so that I could focus on myself and I couldn't even do that properly. 

I don't know what stoics would do in this situation. But for me there seems only two ways, One reaching out to someone like you guys and Second, suicide ",Stoicism,1706213026.0,t3_19fidux,0.72,3

How can Stoicism help me if I am destined to a life of suffering and failure?,"My mom is making me to literally stay in another country, which is Nigeria possibly permanently. I recently am starting to feel depressed because it’s like I am having all of my dreams and goals torn away from me that I wanted to accomplish. I didn’t like the idea of my family controlling my life at all. It’s hard because in Nigeria, there’s no future for me at all. I haven’t even started my life in America yet. In America, I have thousands of student college loans debt, unpaid credit card debt, and so many other medical and debt that’s unpaid and could potentially damage my credit score. I also wanted to go to the gym and get a career for myself as well learn how to fight professionally one day. The issue is that in Nigeria, it’s less than a 1% chance of me accomplishing these goals. Also, getting a job here is difficult and moving to the United States can be very, very hard as hell. I tried to talk to my mom but she doesn’t listen and I have an extremely bad relationship with her. My whole life is basically being thrown away. You see, if I was getting back to America, I would have tried to get the hell away from my family but it was very difficult as hell. Lately, I have been looking into stoicism as for help and guidance. I have the books, Meditations and “How to think like a Roman Emperor “ for help with my mind.

Stoicism and being gay,"Hey,

Ever thought if there are other LGBTQ+ folks like me dealing with stuff from the gay community that’s not so cool? I’ve been wanting some real values and a way of thinking to figure out why I don’t always click with this crowd and why what’s usually accepted doesn’t sit right with me (specifically if you’re a gay man in a big gay friendly city) .

"Using Stoicism to help me control my emotions, communicate more effectively, and be more authentic.","I have found myself in a tough spot within my relationship. I have always struggled with opening up to others and sharing my honest emotions and feelings. I have struggled with telling people “no”, or sharing with them when they have done something that annoys me or hurts me or makes me feel angry.

I also struggle with being defensive in arguments and hurling out harmful words that I don’t actually mean. I feel as if I’m in constant fight or flight mode and struggle to be able to center and calm myself in the middle of difficult conversations, leading to those hard talks turning into blown up arguments.

I feel like I am responsible for these issues we have been having and I am stuck trying to adjust my mentality and fix what I can control in myself to help improve our communication, and in turn, our relationship.

Can Stoicism assist me with this? What tips, readings or advice can you share with me to help me combat my anger, defensiveness, self-criticism, and tendency to not be my authentic self?",Stoicism,1706209469.0,t3_19fgz4g,0.88,6

Half-Sister [50F] reached out to me [42M]: Turns out she's racist and transphobic. How do I empathically and assertively reply?,"TLDR: Half-sister wants to connect but she's clearly got racist and transphobic attitudes that I don't want to just ignore. Do I work with her on it, ask her to just not say that stuff to me, or slam the door, or is there another way?

My dad quite likely got a girlfriend pregnant about a year or two before meeting my mum, though both mum and dad both died 8 years ago. The daughter, ""Rachel"", actually reached out to him by letter when I was a teen. They told us 4 kids about it, but to my disappointment they didn't continue contact with her (as far as I know).

She recently reached out to us 4 siblings to get to know us, and we've talked about getting paternity testing for peace of mind. I'm pretty sure she's our dad's daughter, but as a loner introvert I (and one brother) would prefer empirically knowing before investing in a whole new relationship.

She currently lives overseas with her husband and visited my country last year with a view to moving back here. There wasn't time for either parties to meet in person, but in her summary of her trip she said ""I""m not racist but..."" and then talked about one of the major cities as having ""too many <nationality>, <nationality>, <religion>"", them being rude and hard to get to know, and ""it felt like being in <other nation>"".

She also talked about wanting to move to one of the country towns where ""it's easy to get to know people there and they're so nice and it's just like being back in the old times"".

She's also has previously talked about people that are transexual as not being the gender they're transitioned to, using sports and genetics as her arguments. In that conversation I talked about the variety of sex characteristics, the discrimination that even cis people get for not showing them all, and I tried expressing empathy about the struggles of people that transition or are transitioning.

I tried gentle challenging rather than being confrontational, though it seemed like she held her opinions very strongly. She concluded that we'd ""agree to disagree"".

On the plus side, she's expressed being bisexual, doing some casual drag, and shows no homophobia to my sexuality. But with this additional issue, she clearly yearns for living in a location with little racial or gender diversity, and I can see that I probably can't change her values about her racism and transphobia any time soon.

I personally want to behave according to my principles of compassion, integrity, courage, and truth. I also don't have the energy or time to try empathising with her through these horrible attitudes with the hope that she'll someday open her heart and mind to people different to her.

How do I assertively reply to this while standing by my values?

EDIT:  I forgot to mention Justice as a principle. I'm wondering if there are there any references to virtuous use of time that would also help with figuring out how much to commit to these unjust attitudes and this relationship overall?

Falsely accused but lying and agreeing to the accusation would save the relationship. What would you do?,"
Throughout my life I watched people lie. Lie to get the desired outcome they were seeking. Lie to make themselves appear more prestigious than how they thought society viewed them. Lie to cover an embarrassing moment or situation. Lie as a way to receive love or kindness from others. Lie to protect their families. Lie to provide a decent life for those they love. Lie to advance in their career. Whatever the reason, I can empathize with some decisions to lie but I couldn’t condone it. 

I’ve lied. I’ve lied many times in my life. 
I’ve lied to secure a higher paying job bc society told the hiring managers I wasn’t qualified bc I didn’t have the notable title that said I was capable.  I’ve lied to advance in my career so I could afford to feed my children without the help of foods stamps. I’ve lied to cover shameful situations with the hopes of not disappointing anyone, yet that was never going to be the outcome. I lied to project perfectionism so that I could fly under the radar so that everyone around me could be happy. Even after I was told I could be honest, I still lied. I heard that statement over and over in my lifetime and yet being honest didn’t put food on the table, allow me to pay my water bill before it got shut off for the 3rd time. Being open and vulnerable didn’t encourage those meant to protect me, to do the right thing.  

The time came and I was shown that humans aren’t perfect. They make mistakes. Their mistakes aren’t excusable but what they do moving forward is the only way to make amends, even if no one outside of myself can see the change. I know and the Universe knows. 

I made a promise that I wouldn’t lie again.  No matter the situation. No matter the outcome.  No matter what- I would be truthful and forthcoming. Even if that meant uncomfortable consequences or loss. I’ve stuck to that promise and I’ve worked through the anxiety of having the uncomfortable conversations, the fear that comes from being judged and idea that I don’t have to be perfect to be loved. 

Yet I sit here in a situation where I have the opportunity to lie knowing that the outcome would allow me to stay in a relationship that I would be devastated to lose.  But I can’t…..I want to so badly but I can’t and I’m so angry bc I can’t.  I could hear the “ but no one would know and you can just fix it right now….” Yet that voice isn’t even recognizable to me anymore. I would know! I would carry that heavy weight knowing that I lied to someone I loved and I broke the promise to the most important person in my world….me. 

So, here I am facing the consequences of telling the truth. Having to accept that no matter how hard I’ve tried to prove that I did not do what I’m being accused of, if I would just lie to confirm the accusations then we could work through anything.  Knowing that I’ve lost someone so special to me and all I would need to do to fix everything is lie…..",Stoicism,1706159807.0,t3_19f1rdg,0.33,0

Hope to cope with this Tragedy of 2 years,"I’m 28 M

The Lie of Perception,"Wherever we go, whoever we talk to, whatever we do, has perception behind it. **But as a result of that,** life is not naked.

🧖 Naked? N*aked.* We hold connotations to almost everything we see, hence, our life does not have the b*are-bones naked perception.*

And **Marcus Aurelius directly** encouraged himself to have these **naked perceptions** to remain indifferent, which lead him to write this passage:

>“Like seeing roasted meat and other dishes in front of you and suddenly realizing: This is a dead fish. A dead bird. A dead pig.

>Or that this noble vintage is grape juice, and the purple robes are sheep wool dyed with shellfish blood.

>Or making love - something rubbing against your penis, a brief seizure, and a little cloudy liquid.

>Perceptions like that - latching onto things and piercing through them, so we see what they really are. That's what we need to do all the time - all through our lives when things lay claim to our trust - to lay them bare and see how pointless they are, to strip away the legend that encrusts them.""

>Marcus Aurelius, Meditations (6.13)

🥩 Meat is a dead animal.

👚 Clothes are materials with synthetic dyes.

❤️ Sex is two bodies rubbing together for temporary pleasure.

That **doesn’t mean we should avoid it;** but instead, recognize that it is an indifferent to us. Continue eating meat, wearing clothes (obviously), and having sex, on the basis you’re not allowing these things to **control** you or change your perceptions.

Once you allow *externals to control you,* you become *a slave to yourself* and emotions, which is completely contrary to what the Stoics strived for day-in, day-out.

**We all know the clouded perception we have when we are urged or tempted.**

And these *urges/temptations* are caused by these perceptions.

**See things naked**.

How to deal with people who only respond to anger?,"Stoicism teaches us that no situation is made better with anger. Often times, handling conflict while being angry makes the situation worse than whatever it is you were originally angry about. 

However, what if the person you're in conflict with only responds to anger? I'm mistreated by somebody time after time and despite me calmly and patiently asking them to stop, the mistreatment continues.

"Seneca Letter 111 - ""learn the single principle of despising life"" Uh...what?","[Letter 111, On the Vanity of Mental Gymnastics](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_111), makes perfect sense to me until the last line,

*""... learn the single principle of despising life. 'What? Did you not mean 'control' instead of 'despise'? No; 'controlling' is the second task; for no one has controlled his life aright unless he has first learned to despise it. Farewell. ""*

What does he mean by ""despising life""? Is this an awkward translation and simply another way of saying we should be detached from life's externals, material possessions and irrational fears?

I know he's not saying, ""Hate life."" Perhaps he's saying something closer to ""despise uncontrollable bullshit, before controlling what you can control.""

""Realize most of life is unimportant. Don't worry about the small stuff, because it's almost all 'small stuff.' Only then can you hope make meaningful change with what you do have power over.""

When I come home and reflect at the end of the day, I write of guilt. Guilt from the idea that I'm not keeping fully committed to myself. I do well in keeping away from the shame trap, though something tells me I'm making missteps. This message, however, is foggy in the eye of my mind at best.

What do you think of this? Is there any lessons from Stoicism that might help me reach a little more clarity here?",Stoicism,1706050223.0,t3_19e1iwv,0.57,1
How to deal with students.,"I've been teaching IT and Multimedia for almost 17 years. 90% of my students are young adults and/or adults who are either unemployed and looking for new opportunities or employed professionals looking for an update/new skills. I love my job and always feel good to deal with people from different backgrounds and ambitions.
However, every now and then I have groups of teenagers. Most of them have 0 interest on the subjects and are only attending classes because they're mandatory. Right now I have a class that adds to the mix a high level of indiscipline and bad behavior.
I have always believed that the only way to go is to keep going... And since I found Stoicism I worry only about what I can control... But what can I control on such environment?
I find myself lying on the bed almost looking for an excuse not to go tomorrow.
Giving up is not on my ""DNA"" specially because I need the money and I have a pretty decent reputation on this ""market"" that I don't want to ruin...

my ego and arrogance is growing ever since I became more confident and idk what to do,"When I was a little kid I was an asshole. I didn't really understand at the time until my friends started sharing stories of how I was a complete bully before they knew me, or even when we were friends in middle school. 

In highschool and college I got humbled. No one really liked being around me and a lot of that turned to self hate. Am I really that annoying, am I super ugly, am I not funny or entertaining, why dont people seem to like being around me?

I have spent YEARS self hating because I couldn't understand why I wasn't very likeable. 

Recently I started trying to work on myself and meet more people. 

Here's the thing. Turns out im a really likeable person. I started a new job and everyone loves me there. Not trying to blow smoke up my own ass but the higher up's are always praising me, I keep getting invited to out of work events from multiple coworkers, my friendships are strengthening with them, people are talking good about me behind my back. 

I went half my life thinking im this insanely annoying, unlikeable, lazy, worthless piece of shit. 

Turns out once I stop shitting on people, they actually start enjoying being around me.

Anyways, now im at the point where I know how good I am, both with work and social relationships, and I cant help but feel a bit arrogant. 

Im slacking on my job because I feel invincible. Im being a bit harsh on people because I feel like im above them, Im more aggressive with my jokes because I feel like everyone's on my side...

Coping with Loneliness during my Gap Year,"After high school, I decided to take a gap year before heading off to university. While I am grateful for the time with my parents, the loneliness has been quite overwhelming.

I have a few friends in different cities, but our conversations are limited to once a week. The lack of daily social interaction is taking a toll on me. There are moments when I open my phone, only to find no notifications, and it feels like a heavy weight on my chest. I've shed a few tears because of it, and the days seem to drag on, making time feel slower than ever.

As someone who values Stoic philosophy, I'm reaching out for advice on navigating this lonely period. Despite understanding the principles of focusing on what's in my control, the isolation is taking a toll. Considering getting a cat as a companion to bring some joy and comfort into my days.

Do Gut Microbes Affect Your Prohairesis? | Kathleen McAuliffe | TED,"McAuliffe is an adjunct professor at the University of Miami where she is currently teaching a course on the human microbiome.

In this Ted talk she describes the research that was done with “bubble mice”. Mice grown up in such a sterile environment that they don’t have the gut microbial biome that wild mice have. Her video states that introducing the gut flora of a depressed person to these mice also makes them depressed. And how changes in their gut change the mice’s decision making processes affecting their drive, curiosity and so on.

She goes on to speculate based on other research that the bacteria in our gut contribute to our behaviour by producing the chemicals our brain interprets, and even says they stimulate the vagus nerve directly.

"Did you there was a very influential form of Stoic psychotherapy in the early 20th century, which almost everyone forgot about?","This is a short excerpt from an article I wrote for *The Cambridge Companion to Marcus Aurelius' Meditations*, edited by Dr. John Sellars.  I wish I could share the whole article.  I wanted to publish it here as I know very few people are aware of the fact that an explicitly *Stoic-influenced approach to psychotherapy* was once quite common, at the start of the 20th century.  Dubois and his colleagues often write beautifully and express self-help ideas derived from Stoicism in quite striking and memorable language.  One day, maybe, it would be great to write a popular self-help book based on this forgotten form of Stoic cognitive therapy and explore its relationship with ancient Stoicism in a lot more detail.  I hope some of you find the self-improvement ideas and techniques here helpful.  *Enjoy!*

# Stoicism in Early 20th Century Psychotherapy

Dubois was the first modern psychotherapist to draw directly on Stoicism.  During the first few decades of the 20th century, he was Freud’s main rival.  Indeed, at the First International Congress of Psychiatry and Neurology, in 1907, there was considerable opposition to Freudian psychoanalysis, the more conventional techniques of persuasion and suggestion being still considered central to psychotherapy. 

>Dubois told of his method of treating phobias. Emotions, he said, always follow ideas, so the treatment should go to the root, namely, the erroneous idea the patient has allowed to creep into his mind. (Ellenberger 1970: 797)

Dubois not only shared with the Stoics the premise that emotions are fundamentally cognitive in nature but also the conclusion that by cross-examining someone’s underlying beliefs, through a form of Socratic questioning, we can help them therapeutically.  The psychoanalysts had little or no interest in the methods of ancient philosophy.  In contrast, Dubois clearly stated that he saw Socrates and the Stoics, including Marcus Aurelius, as the forerunners of his own “rational” approach to psychotherapy. 

>If we eliminate from ancient writings a few allusions that gave them local colour, we shall find the ideas of Socrates, Epictetus, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius absolutely modern and applicable to our times. (Dubois 1909: 108-109) 

Dubois noted that, paradoxically, the Stoic words of advice he read in the letters of Seneca, although written in the first century AD, “seem to be drawn from a modern treatise on psychotherapy.”  Moreover, even when Dubois isn’t directly quoting the Stoics, we may detect signs of their influence upon him.  

>We should react briskly, act enthusiastically for good, obey the impulse of our better feelings. But however spontaneous this reaction may be, we must nevertheless leave time for calm reason to exercise a rapid control. Our reason is that which as an arbiter judges finally the value of the emotions of sensibility which make us act. If it is a sentiment of goodness, of pity, which carries us away, reason very quickly gives its approval. But when we are about to give way to a feeling of anger, envy, vexation, reason should intervene to correct the first impression and modify the final decision. (Dubois & Gallatin 1908: 56)

Following the teachings of Epictetus, Marcus likewise reminds himself never to “allow yourself to be wholly carried away by your impressions” (Med. 5.36) for “things go well for a rational nature when it never gives its assent to a false or doubtful impression” (Med. 8.7).  Indeed, this advice to remain mindful that we are not “carried away” by strong desires and emotions seems to have been implied in the writings of Chrysippus and endured all the way down to the time of *The Meditations*.  

Like therapists today, Dubois often recommended reading to his patients as homework.  He felt it was necessary to direct them toward more inspirational and improving texts, “the moralists of all times, and especially to the ancient philosophers, who have portrayed the human soul as the artists of their time fixed the ideal form of  the human body in marble.”  He refers his readers both to the Epicureans and to their rivals the Stoics, particularly the letters of Seneca, *The Handbook* of Epictetus and *The Meditations* of Marcus Aurelius.  “In these works of our predecessors”, he says, “there is an inexhaustible treasure of accurate and fine thought.”  In other words, Dubois considered the perfect complement to his rational psychotherapy sessions to be prescribed reading of the Stoics, including Marcus Aurelius.

Dubois gives the impression, though, of having been more influenced by Seneca.  He mentions him more frequently than the other Stoics.  He also tells a memorable story about a young man to whom he’d prescribed reading Seneca’s letters as therapeutic homework.  As is often the case, the client had grasped the basic idea and was racing ahead of the therapist.  

>A young man into whom I tried to instil a few principles of stoicism towards ailments stopped me at the first words, saying, “I understand, doctor; let me show you.” And taking a pencil he drew a large black spot on a piece of paper. “This,” said he, “is the disease, in its most general sense, the physical trouble – rheumatism, toothache, what you will – moral trouble, sadness, discouragement, melancholy. If I acknowledge it by fixing my attention upon it, I already trace a circle to the periphery of the black spot, and it has become larger. If I affirm it with acerbity the spot is increased by a new circle. There I am, busied with my pain, hunting for means to get rid of it, and the spot only becomes larger. If I preoccupy myself with it, if I fear the consequences, if I see the future gloomily, I have doubled or trebled the original spot.” And, showing me the central point of the circle, the trouble reduced to its simplest expression, he said with a smile, “Should I not have done better to leave it as it was?”

Dubois concludes:

>“One exaggerates, imagines, anticipates affliction,” wrote Seneca. For a long time, I have told my discouraged patients and have repeated to myself, “Do not let us build a second story to our sorrow by being sorry for our sorrow.” (Dubois 1909: 235-236)

He adds that this diagram illustrates that “He who knows how to suffer suffers less.” The burden of physical pain or illness is light when we are able to look at it objectively, without drawing “concentric circles” around it, which multiply our suffering by adding layers of fear.  Although the inspiration for this patient’s rather compelling analogy came from reading Seneca, Dubois had also read *The Meditations*, where he would have encountered the same idea.  

>Let anything from outside that so wishes happen to the parts of me which can be affected by this event; for it is up to them, if that is their will, to make their complaint. But I myself, if I do not suppose that anything bad has happened to me, have yet to suffer any harm; and it is open to me not to make that supposition. (Med. 7.14)

As Marcus put it, our passions do us more harm than the things we’re upset about (Med. 11.18).

Another major Stoic theme in Dubois’ writings is the idea that we should learn to accept events that lie beyond our control.  This is interwoven with observations about causal determinism.  Dubois was an ardent compatibilist, like the Stoics, who believed that the popular concept of absolute “freewill’ derived from metaphysical libertarianism lay at the root of many psychological maladies.  We blame people to an irrational degree when we interpret their actions as being uncaused except by their own volition.  This leads to pathological anger towards others or, when we blame ourselves, to pathological guilt and depression.  Dubois believed that to understand all is to forgive all.  Empathic understanding, though, requires acceptance of the philosophical position that their actions have antecedent natural causes – people do what they do for a reason.

Dubois is led to advocate a philosophy of empathic understanding and brotherly love on the basis of his acceptance of universal causal determinism.  He quotes Marcus Aurelius’ saying, ""Love men with all thy heart"" (Dubois 1909), in order to equate it with the words of Christ, ""Love your neighbour as yourself,"" which he says condenses admirably the moral precept known as the Golden Rule. 

>All things therefore whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, even so do ye also unto them.  (Matt. 7.12)

Although Marcus doesn’t quite state this principle in the same terms, he does refer several times to the Stoic themes of kinship with our fellow men, and the doctrine that we are social creatures designed by Nature for mutual cooperation. 

>Nor can I be angry with my kinsman, nor hate him, for we are made for cooperation, like feet, like hands, like eyelids, like the rows of the upper and lower teeth. To act against one another then is contrary to nature; and it is acting against one another to be vexed and to turn away. (Med. 2.1)

Dubois perhaps had passages such as these in mind when he brings Marcus into his discussion of the Golden Rule.",Stoicism,1705985535.0,t3_19dgev0,0.92,36

Seeking Practical Guidance in Meditations," Good day everyone,

I recently began exploring Marcus Aurelius' *Meditations*, and I've found it to be an insightful journey. While the wisdom within is profound, I'm grappling with the idea that some verses appear to be conventional rules that we encounter in various aspects of life. It raises the question: How can I apply these principles to navigate the complexities of everyday problems?

While it's evident what's generally considered good or bad, what I'm truly seeking is practical guidance on how to confront and handle the challenges that life throws our way. I'm eager to delve deeper into Marcus Aurelius' perspective on the application of stoicism in the real-world scenarios we encounter regularly.

For those who are in this path, how have you personally translated the Stoic principles from Meditaions into practical actions for daily problem-solving?

Are my inclinations and judgements completely up to me?,"From my observations I see that my mind can be in different states.  One of the dimensions is some kind of mental resource - ""a battery"". Depending on the ""battery"" level, the rational faculty operates more accurately and faster or less.  

The rational faculty requires thinking to withhold asent of impressions,  and  to critisize the judgement and believes. And active thinking is consuming a lot of energy.  

The level of the battery is affected by some factors:  the quality of sleep and physical health and activity,  by the food I eat,  by the cognitive load during the day,  etc. Those things are either preferred indifferenes or just indifferences,  and therefore not up to me. 

Does it mean that my inclinations and judgements are not always up to me?
 Maybe they're not really up to me when the"" battery"" is low? When the ""battery"" is low I might think not enough and less accurately, meaning I miss to recognize my inclinations and irrational judgements.

I surely can prioritize the rest and recovery to recharge the battery,  but at the same time I'd like to avoid getting into self-indulgence: postponing some tasks and decisions only because I ""decided"" (I judged) that the battery is low. Moreover, the circumstances sometimes require the best of our mental capabilities even when the battery is not full. Off Course it's difficult to properly judge about the ""battery"" level from within...

Axioms of accountability,"This is something I've been considering for a while, and I thought maybe others would want to add to it. I would like to flesh out a modern stoic system in formal logic. It uses what I would call philosophical logic, basically modal predicate logic. No symbols, everything is written in terse English that can be easily interpreted as philosophical logic. First person pronouns can be universalized to other people. I haven't pre-written any of this out and I request critique. 

First, a lexicon. These are the predicates used below with variables indicate arguments.

- x belongs to y
- x is internal to y
- x is external to y

Here are the axioms of accountability:

1. Nothing that belongs to me belongs to another. (axiom of accountability)
2. Everything is either external or internal to me and not both. 
3. Everything that belongs to me is internal to me.
4. Not everything that is internal to me belongs to me.

Deductions: 

- Nothing external to me belongs to me. (2 and 3)
- Something internal to me belongs to another. (1 and 4)

Im tired of everything. I want to improve and change so badly. I wanna do the work just dont know what to work on. What actionable steps do i take??,"These are my thoughts: I dont like this clown guy trying everything just to entertain and please others, or be needy or desperate and says things and gets ignored, or overexplains and they just reply with one words, or his ""friendships"" are all one sided and no one asks about him, or tries too hard or makes fun of himself just to make others laugh or takes things personally or insults others or puts others down, im 2 years into college and still have no friends, its like i want to feel important heard and seen by everyone, and i feel like i have nothing to offer, and i get forgotten quickly, i hate this guy. 

Its like i try to put on a performance for others like am a circus clown. And try to entertain them and i dont really get to know them because i dont know what to talk about. 

I know i bore others, and others aren't interested in me, maybe im not truly interested in them and i just want to get their attention and approval just to feel better about my self. Its like im a sucker for attention and approval. I hate this guy. 

I think my problem is self esteem and confidence. 

Many said to find my interests, and do things that make me happy on my own, and im trying really hard to stay away from porn, i try to dress nicely. And try to be respectful, im reading, 

 i try to ask questions about others,but still get end up getting ghosted in real life or texting, in texting its way more common and i think irl people just respond to be nice. 


I got called boring, a girl said that i had too much free time because i was trying to entertain her with my stories, and i wasnt interested in her i was more interested in her giving me attention and laughing so i feel better about my self. Selfish af i know. 

Im tired of trying to make people the source of my happiness . Im trying to find happiness on my own. Being happy about the little things, fighting my negative battles and setting boundaries, being greatful for just being alive, not depending much entire personality on others reactions, and not counting every thought as reality. But once i fail an interaction it all goes downhill or i get ignored . And tell myself ""i knew it"" i even try to tell my self that maybe my behavior was wrong not my personality

I guess it all goes back to basing my self worth on others actions and thoughts and words towards me

Now before any interaction i tell my self that my self worth isnt based on others reactions or opinions. 

I know others are attracted to positivity and how you make them feel when you are with them, i know i shouldn't text just because im bored

So now what? Do i pick something i dont like about my self and work on it since self improvement is so vague, Find a hobby an interest a passion? Do i keep reading? I wanna take action to change my self. I dont wanna just keep repeating the same freaking cycle that am stuck in, i dont wanna keep coming here and asking for advice and still be the same people pleaser. 

Im even trying to change my self beliefs by doing or saying things that i like and avoiding things that i dont like. 

I keep trying to find whats most important to me, it should be me but what? Things that make me happy? 

Everyday i go to my roof and some suicidal thoughts come in but i tell my self that im not someone who gives up. But i also dont wanna keep wasting time and my effort with no results... 

And maybe im still trying to base my efforts on others reactions. Like i say something or do something and it doesn't go well i tell my self that i haven't learned anything... maybe im still seeing ""making friends""  as a goal to achieve to feel better about my self. 

Maybe i need to accept my self and my life. But still work on things i need to improve",Stoicism,1705953980.0,t3_19d4w7j,0.74,7

Why We Shouldn't Give Up,"When we’re physically exhausted, there are a lot of remedies: relaxing, sleeping, resting, etc…

But when we’re mentally exhausted, our minds gravitate to only one solution: *giving up.*

I know for me personally, when I feel like I've had enough I always get thoughts like *“Is this even worth it?”* or *“Why am I doing this?”* or the infamous ""*I don't feel like doing this anymore.""*

Mental exhaustion will make us give up long before our physical exhaustion gets to us. At times, I simply felt like kicking the can and throwing everything off my desk. But Marcus Aurelius reminds us that **it is a mistake** to do so:

&#x200B;

> ""Disgraceful: for the soul to give up when the body is still going strong."" - Meditations (6.29)

&#x200B;

Physically giving up because of mental exhaustion thwarts our human nature to persevere. Thwarting perseverance makes us give up the difficult (and most likely beneficial) long-run for short-term rest. 

We should recognize that feelings are constantly fleeting; what you feel today may quite possibly be the opposite of what you feel tomorrow. 

*I do agree that there are times where you should give up without taking things to the extreme: If you're injured, give up on working the injured body part temporarily. If you recently have started a business and you can't see yourself doing it a few years down the future, give up before you become too invested into it.* 

**But we should discern these feelings from giving up simply because of laziness/exhaustion.**

On whatever venture you’re walking down that you're confident in, it will be difficult. It will most likely question why you’re walking down it in the first place. It will give you mental exhaustion to heights you may not expect. I know I have questioned myself whenever I embarked on difficult ventures, 100%.

But **who said** it’s not supposed to be like that? 

We owe it to ourselves to not give up because of a fleeting feeling, trading off short-term comfort for a potentially better future.

Dealing with chronic illness,"I have chronic scalp folliculitis - it started when I was 18, and this May it will have been 12 years of suffering. It causes my entire scalp to be inflamed, and produces these acne-like pustules. It is not a pretty sight, it is painful, it constantly itches, and it has had a major influence on my focus, mental health, self-esteem, and overall well-being. 

No doctor or dermatologist have ever been able to figure out the cause, and I’ve tried many harsh courses of various medications without any long term effect (except for giving me a few frustrating long term side effects, from accutane especially). 
I’ve done and am doing everything within my control - I live healthy, I avoid potential food triggers, I’ve found the best routines to manage it, and have realized I just need to accept to live with it … but how does one do that? 
I am generally good at accepting it as “it is what it is”, but more and more often I catch myself living in a state of self-pity and feeling cheated; or like some curse or life in general is out to get me. I know it’s ridiculous, but I find it harder and harder to live with this disease. It holds me back from so many things in life, and it feels so incredibly unfair. 

From a stoic point of view, how can I build resilience to this toxic mindset so I can live with it? I know that it is counter-productive to think about it negatively, but since I’ve run out of options for treatment and there’s no healing in sight, I just don’t know how I can get my mind on track to deal with it.

"The more I interact with people, the more I realize my flaws and disregard for safety. Help.","The more I interact with people the more I realize I lack some skills essential to survival and that's because of my unique circumstances.

I always wanted to be a high achiever. I have read and re-read all ancient stoic texts many times. I have a large number of friends. Yet I still think I have some basic and dangerous flaws, especially if I learn from my online interactions.

In person I believe I am a clear communicator, but when it comes to digital communication people straight up say I am a bad person. Where I come from, all my behaviors are normal and in fact I am less dangerous to myself than others.

But still I have made some bad decisions in my life, like the one time where I should have hired lawyers to protect me from corrupt anti-democratic officials from annoying me.

I was forced an overly academic life - despite that I have at least in theory excellent social skills and excellent understanding of overview of stoicism.

So I was wondering how to fix some basic flaws in me, right now. I always wanted to join special forces reserves, but if Reddit thinks (based on a limited text-only version of me, albeit) I am ""creepy"" or whatever, where the fuck has everything gone wrong so horribly?

I don't think anybody lives a perfect life. I always try to live virtuously and I am always trying to be the best version of myself, including in terms of

* Social connections
* Basic skills and abilities in all aspects of life, whether soft skills, hard skills or life skills.
* Time management
* Stoicism as a personal guidance philosophy.
* Working as a lawyer, pursuing an LLM after LLB, joining the army reserves after a shit ton of work on my health, keeping family happy, etc. are some of my goals.

But if based on my text, if Reddit people say I am not good enough... is it true? I don't think it is, although offline I do get shit also - they don't understand I am from a minority community.

[Here](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/06/racial-wealth-gap-may-be-a-key-to-other-inequities/) is a good introduction to ""wealth inequality"" by Harvard. Just posting it here for additional context.

Edit: In a developing country resources or services are not readily available. Judicial cases go on for like decades even for lawyers themselves (if the lawyer is the victim) and thus obviously I learned some irresponsible or grandiose stuff or did just plain wrong (like never hiring a lawyer - that's a recipe to be targeted by criminal groups) and only very recently I have been taking steps to ensure my protection.

Question about stoicism,"So, let’s imagine you are training for a job during a month. Interview come, but you didn’t get it.

« Not having a job » is not objectively bad, from the universe point of view. It’s only bad if you consider it being bad. And i saw several video saying « to see it as an opportunity to find a better job »

But…if staying unemployed was better, or gave you better career opportunities, why would you have trained then? If you prepared to get this job, that mean you considered being hired as a good thing no? Meaning not being hired is a bad one.

The Value of a Stoic Mindset in real life,"Hello everyone. I have been reading as many of the posts and comments hear and thought as an inspiration I would share a recent experience where a Stoic mindset provided a moment of clarity to me...... 

I am choosing not to use names or genders in this post. It has to do with my work. 

Context I work as an Aircraft Engineer, I gain a great deal of happiness in my career and have worked for many years to finish my masters degree in alternative engine design.  

Thursday a coworker was ""having a bad day"" although this seems to be a common occurrence with this individual. This person was yelling out about everything that is wrong, how they were the only one doing certain things, implying that the rest of us are lazy, incompetent, and in general being mental abusive The quote form Epictetus  ""Control what you can, cope with what you cant, and concentrate on what truly matters.""  kept me in line for most of the work day until the individual turned their attentions to me. Clearly my calm and the dedication to my work bothered them as myself and three others were the only ones not engaging in the hateful exchanges that were in the work place.

All of a sudden I was the primary target for this persons anger and rage. Nothing I was doing was correct, I was being unsafe, and I am stupid. I am aware of myself and although I'm Dyslexic I am by no means stupid. I could feel my anger and rage mounting and was about to engage with said individual when I was reminded ""The best revenge is to not be like your enemy."" I paused a moment and looked at the source of so much negativity in the work place, allowing my thought to settle I smiled saying 'What you have said is all very interesting and informative, I always seek to better myself and accept your point of view.' My coworker stopped clearly this person were expecting me to stand my ground and argue, or give a snappy retort as others had been doing all day. The appearance of cooky confidence that had been plastered across their face all day vanished in an instance, stuttering and mumbling ""well.. just do better."" That was the only response I got, still smiling 'I wish you a good life.' I replied my colleagues were shocked not believing that the terror had been delt with so effortlessly.

Remember the more you embrace the stoic teachings, mindset, and lifestyle the easer it becomes to deal with the situations that cause us all stress.

Love hurts like hell and I need advice from people,"I am seeking not only advice but needed some people to hear what I wanted to say, my story and such.

I have a girl best friend, and we have been friends for six years now, and have been best friends ever since, 2 years after being friends, she wanted to be my girlfriend, but I declined because I had just broken up with my past best friend, she got sad but we continued to be best friends, fast forward a few years later, she went to another country and we continued to be best friends, and we made a promise that if neither of us got someone, when we made thirty we would marry.

 I have seen some people do this but I really don't know where it's from, when I made the promise I wasnt thinking much about it, since she was in another country I really didn't care much, other than that, we are best friends right?

 Well, gentleman, life sure has some cursed humor, because when she came back for a little while, I was head over heels for her, and felt my heart hurt everytime we weren't near, all I could think about was her, she then went back to the country she is living, and I thought the feeling would pass, but oh well it didn't.

I am very emotional, and tried some stoic philosophy before, but my chest hurts a lot everytime I try to do this kinda of stuff, and well, I told her, told her that if needed I would wait for years if that meant she would wait for me, she told me that I shouldnt do that, tha I should live my life, she is right, I should.
Then I proceeded to not do that.
And now she has a boyfriend that she met a few months ago.

Now, why is this dumbass emotional man coming here to say all of this, I just needed to say, I saw this coming from a mile away, I'm not blind, she was getting distant, and we weren't really talking, more answering each other, I remember thinking of excuses, but we are practically adults now, life doesn't work like a fairytale, there isn't a princess waiting in the castle to marry for a promise we made years ago, even then, I convinced myself that it wouldn't happen, I heard it all, that this kind of promise is a backup plan, the so called Friendzone and things like that, and well, In the back of my mind I knew, so why does it hurt like hell over here? Is there some radical stoic way of thinking that won't hurt my chest everytime I think about someone I loved in the arms of another person? This is more of a rambling, I don't know how this community sees this kind of thing,

 I'm just asking for wisdom, a little push to grow as a person from people that are more experienced than me, so I'm being a little more vulnerable here, yes I'm happy for her it just hurts, thanks for your patience.",Stoicism,1705893960.0,t3_19cm15t,0.72,9
To Just Do What's Right,"❄️️**Imagine** it’s a **cold winter morning** on a **Saturday.** You promised yourself that you’d wake up early, go the gym, go run, etc… You wake up; however, it’s cold.

*Too cold.*

🛌And you find that it’s warm under the blankets.

*Addictively warm.*

Instead of following through on the promise you made, you stay and keep sleeping… because the condition would worsen if you left.

Marcus Aurelius **felt** the same thing. He noticed that doing what’s right is hindered by our state of condition. But as a means of discipline, he outlined that, **regardless of our condition,** *we must keep going:*

&#x200B;

>**Just that you do the right thing. The rest doesn't matter. Cold or warm. Tired or well-rested. Despised or honored."" - Meditations (6.2)**

We must always do the right thing\*\*, especially\*\* and **most notably** when we are suffering or there’s a potential of suffering.

🚲 I have to bike 30km (18.6 miles) to school every other day. And while most days I am disciplined to get out of bed, *there are still those days that I wake up and struggle to throw my blanket off of me.*

""It's so nice and warm"" I tell myself.

It's a constant battle I have. And I'm sure other people have the same battle but in different circumstances. However, I always remind myself of this quote whenever I get up: ""I have to do what's right. I was born to do what I am doing now, so I should begin doing it."" And so should others; regardless of what you're doing, make sure it's the right thing.

The **state** of our human condition **should not** define what we decide to do and which promises we decide to break.

Does life being unfair justify us being unfair?,"I'm from Argentina, currently in my second year of university. Last year, my interest in politics and stoicism grew. I witnessed the injustices within politics and the university – instances where individuals lacking knowledge are hired due to connections with family and acquaintances.

Last night, I discussed these issues with my mother. In her job, many co-workers benefit from the privilege I mentioned earlier -working without having studied anything. She has witnessed corruption and theft committed by managers and coworkers.

To all this, she told me that she did not want the same thing that happened to her to happen to me; she struggles every month with financial problems, while those who take advantage of privileges, those who steal, those who are hired without ever making an effort in studying, they live comfortably without having to worry about their money.

For all this, she advised me to take advantage of any opportunity that appears. Because the others wont hesitate to take it.

I expressed to her that unlike those who took advantage of these privileges, she can be happy to get her money honestly and legally, to which she replied that no one takes from those people what they enjoyed with that money.

What would a stoic say to her? Do you think that in circumstances in which all people act unfairly, it is justified to act unfairly as well? Even if acting correctly means not being able to feed your family tomorrow?",Stoicism,1705881040.0,t3_19chnpl,0.89,58
I don’t know if I’m properly practicing stoicism,"I ask that because it feels like I’m only applying parts of the philosophy to my life, and stoics believe in constant practice or else you’re not a proper stoic 

I also don’t apply the temperance method to my life, where I’m constantly letting my pleasures get in the way of a proper routine, and I understand that this is a crucial step to fix 

I also believe in principles of pragmatism, materialism and existentialism 

Where one focus on the actions rather than the theory alone, be flexible with your environment, scientific explanations such as a person’s pre disposed biology and different results of chemical reactions in their brains but not in a sense of limitation as one can work hard/with different methods to achieve their goals (I assume that one can study other philosophies and not devote to only one) 

I honestly believe that the best way for a person to live their lives is to follow an above average lifestyle and have discipline with their actions, no one will strictly work out 9x a week for 6 hours straight and study the rest of the day and not sleep or eat nor will waste your life with mundane things, it’s always the best to find a middle ground, we are only human beings we are animals but we have logic and is this logic that gives us control over our raw emotions and desires such as understanding that you need to exercise and study but allow yourself the time to rest and enjoy life",Stoicism,1705872619.0,t3_19cedhc,0.57,1

So recently I found a palpable lump in my chest just below my collarbone, and every day I feel some pain radiating from it.

I went to the doctor the other day, hoping that it would just be my hypochondria and to be sent off fine, but the doc confirmed that there is a lump there, and they took blood to find out if it is ""an accumulation of cells"", whether that be benign or malignant and so on.

I haven't got the blood test results back yet, and I have been emotionally very all over the place, going from feeling fine, to straight up crying for hours. To be honest, I am a bit scared.

""An animal decays upon death, rocks seemingly eternal withers against time. Even trees who stand straight bows down eventually. What about the mind and soul?

My own interpretation is the following:  
""It's hard to be a good person when no one is watching. But know that posterity always watches. When you understand that your body and belongings will be returned at some point, and together with your actions(the result of your thoughts) will be judged by posterity. Then you will always be motivated to do the right thing.""

Turning to you guys for help. Lost faith in life.,"Stoicism has helped me through many of my tough times but I’m out of it now, I’ve slipped into depression. 

This is why: I’m from a fairly lowly background and I dedicated my life to a career.  The idea was I would prove my worth by becoming successful through grit.  

Over the last few years:

One of my friends from a well-connected family got an offer from a friend - a connection.  He spent a lot of his life living like a playboy and now he’s leapfrogged me in career due to the network he has that I don’t. 

My other friend who didn’t graft like me is set in inherit money I would never dream of. 

My brother, who has spent a lot of his life avoiding hard work, has pushed a pretty weak medical negligence claim but will win more money than I’ll ever have and retire from it.  

My parents inherited all the family money and left nothing for us, spent it all on drugs and alcohol and on my brother.  

Now I am trapped working long hours in a hard career and I have less than all these people.  As I have to work hard my daughter is having issues in school.

The link between what I do and what I get is broken.  I’ve ended up with less than everyone but I did everything right.

I’m losing faith in life, everything.  I want to give up, it keeps happening. Everyone I know is ending up wealthy through fate and I’m stuck still with a mortgage, long hours etc. 

What was it all for?  I can’t stop as we will be impoverished.   Why did fate choose me to be the worker?  The other hilarious point is my earnings are taxed heavily but all their inheritance and claim is tax free, so I’m having to pay their taxes too. 

I know these are externals etc but I got to wake up at 5 every day and have health problems.  I got to have less time with kids. It’s not money, it’s my quality of life.

What drugs was Marcus Aurelius taking?,"Galen, his physician, says that Marcus Aurelius took a traditional remedy called *theriac*, which contained ""a grain"" of opium. We don't know what precise quantity this denotes, unfortunately, but Galen seems to be implying that it was a small amount.  Marcus complained that it was making him drowsy, so Galen reduced the dose further.  Some people have speculated that he was an addict.  I don't think the evidence supports that conclusion as use in very small doses, from what I gather, wouldn't necessarily lead to addiction, and the fact that Marcus requested a *reduction* in the does perhaps also speaks against it.

What's less well-known, perhaps, is that we're told several times in the Roman histories that when Marcus finally visited Athens he was initiated into the mysteries at nearby Eleusis, in a ceremony which entailed drinking a potion known as the *kykeon.*  In his bestseller, *The Immortality Key: The Secret History of the Religion with No Name*, Brian C. Muraresku collects evidence that suggests the *kykeon* contained ergot, cultivated for its hallucinogenic properties.  Marcus' trip to Eleusis seems to have been an important public event but it happened in 176 CE, which was probably after he'd finished writing the *Meditations*.

Incidentally, a bust of a Roman emperor, believed to be Marcus, was placed over the main gate of the Temple of Demeter at Eleusis.  It still exists there today ([photo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Cuirassed_bust_of_Marcus_Aurelius%2C_Eleusis_%2813945732075%29.jpg)).

Years later,"Hi All, 28F looking for some advice here..

I grew up in a small town with a tight group of friends from elementary school through high school. Growing up, we were attached and all thought we’d be friends for the rest of our lives, in each others weddings etc. When we went off to college, we each went our separate ways, got jobs in different cities but stayed in contact thru social media, keeping each other up to date in a group message. At the time, I had gotten into a new relationship which eventually became toxic. I had made some new friends where I was studying/working and they knew about what was going on and what I was dealing with but I was so reluctant to tell my hometown friends about what I was going through.. I remember feeling embarrassed by the situation I was in. They all seemed happy and successful and I didn’t know how to communicate it. 3-4 months go by, (maybe more, I can’t remember exactly) where I don’t respond or update my life in this group message. One day I sign on and see that one of the girls removed me from the group. I remember a ton of emotions and at that time (6-7 years ago) I was still young and spite got over me, so I deleted all of my socia accounts which of course was wrong in hindsight. The first few months I felt pissed/angry and then as time went on, I felt an immense amount of guilt for never addressing it properly.  I’m at a point in my life where I know that we all moved on and that’s life, to accept it and I don’t feel as guilty as I did, considering no one reached out to me during one of the hardest times of my life to see how I was doing. But Im now having my own milestones my life and I miss them and so I’m having a hard time accepting it at the moment and I’m starting to feel guilty again",Stoicism,1705785978.0,t3_19bmd61,0.67,3
I've been (is) worried about the state of the world - was told about Stoicism,"Hello. I have been doomscrolling throughout the internet. I've been keep reading bad news all over the world ever since europe warns citizens from Russia.

I have a problem with not knowing everything and I cannot accept it (right now).

I'm a father, kid is 1 years old, I love him to death. I wish nothing bad to ever happen to him (like every parent I hope). After all this war related stuff, i've been very depressed and I fear for the future.

I've been reading about Russia/Ukraine, NATO/Russia, North Korea threats, Iran building nukes, Israel/Gaza war, China/Taiwan. To a point where I just couldn't handle all the information and just broke.

&#x200B;

So i've come here, hoping to learn from you guys. I don't know much about stoicism but I read this simple definition of the term ""In simple terms, Stoicism **teaches us to focus on the things we can control—our thoughts, emotions, and actions—while accepting the things we cannot**, such as the actions of others or the natural course of events going on in the world around us.""

This is probably just what I need to learn in my life, but I don't know how to accept that this is what I need to do.

Thanks for reading.

My feeling when I am unhappy in general,"Hello, dear friends! ❤️

I have very difficult situation..
I am unhappy now .. in everything..
I am confused und very tired emotionally in soul. 

A lot of different situations create responsibilities for me which I must to do. It is not fantasy, it is from reality. 
As example, to study German language every day from 7:30 - 16:30 on classic school in 14 faculties and after study it in integration course 17:00-19:15 Monday - Thursday.
After I have to do a lot of tests and exams in Bio/Chemie/History/German Literature/Ethik/Art/Informatik/Math/another subjects in school for grades minimum 4 - maximum 1-2. And I have to do general exam in B1 German from integration course in March.
And in Juni I have to do Exam from German History for integration.

In another side, I have to do a volunteer project in school because it is special  important program for to get grades for all students in 9 classes from 3 faculties - GRW, Deutsch, Ethik. It is a main responsibility inside school for everyone in 9 class.

And also I have to do a lot of homeworks in 14 faculties of school and in integration course. 

I have to go to doctors also at this time when I must to be in the lessons.

I have to send all documents for Jobcenter because of Bafög (Bafög is smaller for me then Burgergeld which I got earlier. I can not to pay for my flat by this money, and for food it is also not anough per month). I have to write in Email a lot about it for Jobcenter. I am tired also of it.

I have to have good grades in study. When grades will badly in study faculties or in exam of integration German, - in faculties I have to repeat 9 class once more, and in integration corse I have to pay new course to repeat last level of German language because it is new law which government of Germant created for Ukrainians in January 2024. It is a biggest stress.

In result...

I love in my heart English, study in English, work in profession in English (as a UI/UX Designer - 5 years, Front-End developer - 7 years). 
I love to paint illustrations in study materials also.
I love a lot to be as a mentor in developing software (have 2 years experience in this area).
But...
I can not to do it in Germany.. because they from government wanted from me to study German language and go to work which they want (not a developer, not a designer/illustrator). For designer/illustrator/developer in requirements for work in companies they need a lot of ""Ausbildung in Graphik/Kunst/Digital"" , ""B2 Deutsch"", ""Akademische Ausbildung"".
When I see it, I feel myself unhappy. 

I am cry today a lot when I opened German language book of integration because I have to do a lot of Homeworks of study it, and I really hate it now(o Got, I said it.. hope, the Germans will not hate me of this). 

Why I have to do things and processes in Germany which I don't like/hate/because another institutions want it?

I feel happy when I paint illustrations of study books/materials, when I teach development for somebody and believe in this person, when I see how my student goes to get win in study process and how he gets it with happy in his face, when I can develop software by myself, when I can do researchment and read / collect special data of research for create some functions in software.. 

But.. I can not to do it in Germany.. 
I have education in internet from Ukraine, not from Ausbildung in Deutschland.. it is not enough here for work and study, and study German language for my mind is more difficult as English.

I really love English with all my heart.. I also would like to teach English for German people as a teacher.. but this needs Uni/Studium of Teaching and special license of teaching (only according German standards of teaching)

When I understand this, I am cry once more..
I am confused.. 

What do you think, what will do in my place Aristoteles or Mark Aurelius?/or Kannt/ or Nicshe?

I am very grateful for your help..

Because today I am in a border of depression..
During all last week I had to take Krankenschein because I am very tired psychologically and physically.. 

I am grateful you 🙏

Advice like ""life is too short for this"" and ""They don't think about you"", or ""You can't control their thoughts"", or ""It's all in your head"", are kind of useless when my reaction is automatic and my thoughts are buried in my subconsciousness.

It isn’t an event happening under my control. So it isn’t my job specifically to get involved. Even if I did get involved, the preventing of one instance won’t change the person doing the harm. They will continue to harm people. 

But another rationale to even think about interfering is that I really want to to create an environment in my business where everyone is treated with dignity. But I am also young and haven’t been given the responsibility or ownership to the business yet and any involvement in advising family members would only make relationships worse. 

How would you make a rational decision when something so complicated comes up? And in general, is it your job to stop injustices, or just accept it and move on knowing that there is evil everywhere.",Stoicism,1705739111.0,t3_19b750f,0.81,10
What would be beneficial for Stoic Student Association?,"Hello fellow stoics, I'm reaching out today for some ideas/suggestions on various items for a budget that might be useful for a Stoicism club at my university. I have the privilege of being able to construct a budget where I request money for the upcoming fiscal year that should be used to further the mission statement of the organization, which is quoted as follows:

>The Stoic Student Association’s mission is to educate the public on the lessons of Stoic philosophy and encourage the practical application of the teachings of philosophers from the Hellenistic to Roman Empires and beyond. In one meeting, we aim to discuss a particular Stoic lesson by engaging in discussion, sharing thoughts and experiences, and molding the idea to work in the modern world. Anybody is welcome to learn more about these teachings and provide insightful conversation to all members of the club. Ultimately, these Stoic teachings were developed thousands of years ago, and therefore a very important process for all members will be deciding how to interpret and practice them in the modern era.

I have the following ideas so far:

* Books
* Merchandise
* Special Events

However, at the current moment I only believe that books are the best source of information and progression for the organization, as they directly fit the mission statement of educating the public and leading to more engaging and thoughtful discussion. For merchandise, I suppose I could spin it to encouraging members to practice the philosophy and have it fit in the mission statement, and for special events, I don't even know what that really could be but it just sounds cool. Ultimately in the future I would like to have a notable modern Stoic maybe on a virtual call with the club, but that would be likely in a few years and by that time I'll be out of uni and seems like a stretch for the first budget request

Does anyone have any other ideas on items I could request on the budget that would fit the mission statement? One additional note is that we are a relatively small club (15 people total, maybe 6/7 per meeting sometimes). 

Thanks in advance for any suggestions!",Stoicism,1705721063.0,t3_19b24xp,0.67,2
My classmates think i am a creep but i cant prove i am not,"I am an international student and i have history of anxiety and depression. I was on meds for an year two years ago. I came to Canada to do my masters. Initially it was all good but on one day while i was walking on a street, a random stranger was acting weird by coming in and out of my sight alternatively in both sides behind me. I fret and kept an eye on him and suddenly from behind he tried to attack me. I barely dodged it. I ran away quickly to place where many people were there. This incident has triggered me anxiety and panic. I never reported or did anything about this.

Now in my class, there was this girl who always sat infront of me diagonally. I never noticed earlier but she was always making sudden movements, looking back dont know why, this has triggered my anxiety and panic and hypervigilance. My mind would switch to fight or flight kind of mode. Even without my control i would keep tabs on her from corner of my eye. I try not to but my anxiety and panic mind could never be controlled. I think at some point she picked that im looking at her from corner of eye. I feel bad because of fearing what she might think of me. I changed my seating place finally. It was all good but even in my new place, another girl who sat triggered my anxiety due to her sudden movements. Its becoming tough to me, i changed places but i noticed that this girl is also staring at me occasionally and i feel atrociously bad for sending such signals. I never have any kind of feelings or anything like that. Now i suspect or think others are also picking on that i am kind of a creep staring at women etc. I am changing my places and avoided seating near women st all due to this fear but I cant control my anxiety as i always fear due to the aggression attack i faced two months back.

I am trying to get back on my meds and began practising mindfulness. I came to know im suffering from hyperawareness, sensorimeter ocd coupled with anxiety. Due to mindfulness.  Its getting better and i am  changing my places(i plan to stop this). But i hate being perceived as a creep but i guess i cant do anything about it.  I yell to myself that their opinions on me dont matter as i am stoic follower, but i am finding it hard getting out of it. I think im silently suffering.

the thing I struggle with in this scenario is dealing with some strange feeling i cant identify i deal with jealousy and while that was something i ignored in the relationship now that i ended things i feel guilty for worrying about who she may or may not be with. its a struggle just to be in the same room as her i have been able to manage my emotional reaction and not make rash decisions based on my feelings but the struggle i face is internal i understand that stoicism is not the practice of not feeling emotions but i do wish there was a way to temper my internal monologue a bit especially when i hear or see things that make me over think. i don't struggle with dealing with an external reaction at all i just struggle with being stoically minded particularly in the sense of what i do and do not control i want to be able to be at peace and happy knowing that she and her actions are not in my control and that it doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things one quote in particular ""we often struggle more in imagination then in reality"" comes to mind and im looking for any advice that might pertain to gaining the ability to be at peace internally and not just externally ",Stoicism,1705713098.0,t3_19azgto,0.4,0
Dealing with shitty neighbors.,"So I have these neighbors who are an absolute unit of dumbfuckery. My apartment has indoor hallways to get to the units and they consistently leave trash around for the cleaning lady to deal with. I'm talking zero regard for any kind of decency: throw up, fast food wrappings, melted chocolate (which really bothers me because of my dog.)
I'm struggling on how to deal with this the proper way and I'm trying to turn to stoicism, as I have in the past to try to find the best solution. I'm not too versed in stoicism besides the introductory readings, such as Aurelius and Epictetus, so any advice is much appreciated.
On one hand I can see the stoic belief being to make society better with what I can control i.e. helping the cleaning lady out picking up trash as I go and such.
However, as is the pattern with many shitty people this just reinforces the bad behavior.

By whom are the 4 basic stoic vritues that get so often quoted on here?,"I've read a bit Marc Aurel and some interpretations of Epictetus and those very never (as the ""cardinal virtues"") mentioned. Online (horrible source though) it seemed like the 4 virtues are by Zeno himself, but it didn't seem very legit at all.

Personally, it seems to me that people (on this sub as well) often use these as an easy way out (rather than an easy way into more stoicism) and oversimplify their world view by trying to follow them to the end. Of course i've seen them beeing mentioned, but only amongst other wisdoms (or ""virtues"" for the sake of it). All of them are mentioned countless times in meditations the interpretation of Epictetus i read, but never as THE BIG FOUR.

Maybe someone here has some bigger knowledge on that or maybe you know a sub (maybe history subs?) where this question may be more likely to get answered.",Stoicism,1705704626.0,t3_19aw8rp,0.81,21

My biggest life mistake was wanting to live an easy life,"2023 summons this the best, I didn’t want to exercise, diet, barely studied, barely did anything useful, expected my friend to do all the work for me, procrastinated a lot by saying that “tomorrow I start to do this”, got addicted to porn, tried to be a people pleaser (even going against some of my own believes), etc 

I regressed a lot as a person and what  were my rewards for wanting to live an easy life basically in autopilot with no logic and following just pure emotions ? Anxiety, memory issues, suicidal thoughts, weight gain, burnout, a lot of extra final exams that almost cost me a full semester, almost lost some of my friendships, i got way behind my peers and didn’t get my driver’s license 

Growing up I was never pushed/expected to do great things, if I was average that was enough for my parents and me, my mom basically did my homework for me, I would eat and watch tv all day and not leave the apartment and no one would care, so I never developed discipline, sense of urgency and maturity 

I have my ups and downs but basically to this day I lack those core elements and the 4 stoic principles 

With no temperance no self discipline nor control so I will waste my days with pleasurable things and just “do the important things tomorrow”, even tho nothing guarantees me a tomorrow

With no wisdom no intelligence and resourcefulness making me have bad grades at my college and be afraid to treat patients (I’m learning to be a dentist but I don’t reread core concepts such as anesthesia so I just ask my friend to do all the work for me at the clinic)

With no courage no scape from my comfort zone so I don’t try to improve myself 

With no justice I abandon my principles of wanting to be a good man and focus only on pleasing people and not strengthening or even developing a sense of character 

I hope that this serves me as an experience of what living a shallow existence is and how to always try to be better than yourself from yesterday (even if it takes baby steps)",Stoicism,1705691126.0,t3_19aqv6w,0.97,183

Does stoicism care anything about how simplistic or grand your goals are?,"I've been thinking a lot about meaning lately, and I guess I'm in somewhat of a crisis. 

I know a lot of people in the world might say that if you want meaning or purpose in your life you need a respectable goal. Which, on the surface, I can understand. 

My concern is that...what does it mean if you can't? What if you fail? We're all prone to do so. What if other obligations come along and you have to give up your dreams? What if you become disabled? What if you straight up die the very day you decide on a goal? 

I'm not saying that if someone is dreaming of being an astronaut they should just give up. But should our goals be where we find meaning and contentment? 

is there something, existing independent of our ability - or even desire - to self-actualize, from which we can draw value in our lives? ",Stoicism,1705689787.0,t3_19aqbnt,0.67,3
How does one stop being so emotional?,"
Hello,

A few months ago, I stumbled upon stoicism, and I've been thoroughly enjoying immersing myself in its teachings and practicing to become a true stoic, striving to be the best version of myself. However, I find that I'm facing a challenge in effectively harnessing my emotions. I comprehend that the teachings emphasize the practice of refraining from expressing unnecessary emotions, but I'm particularly struggling with becoming less emotional, especially in my interactions with other people. How can one navigate the path to emotional restraint and cultivate a more stoic approach, particularly in interpersonal relationships?

Even though I have researched and tried to apply my findings of stoicism, I feel that the one thing I still struggle to control is my emotional decision-making.

It’s easy to say to yourself “stop being emotional,” but I find it’s counterintuitive, especially if you encounter situations that will strike an intense emotion.

I appreciate your feedback.",Stoicism,1705688478.0,t3_19apsri,0.83,11

Today I will begin a path of gratitude,"4 years ago, coming out of high school. I experienced mental struggles that changed myself and the way I view life. For over a year, I struggled with severe depression and anxiety. While it did get a bit better, these mental issues underlied my time in college. They were related to regret, guilt, and insecurity.

4 years later in the present. I'm honestly in a position I never thought I'd be in. I've gained a lot of personal confidence, lost social anxiety, have a great girlfriend, and will be starting a job after college making more money than I could ever imagine.

But still, lately I've found myself more low than normal. Starting to spiral down into some of my old thoughts. Which are triggered by specific things that I won't get into. These past years, I don't think i've ever truly felt peaceful and free, at best I could push my thoughts away and try to ignore them. 

4 years of overthinking, dark thoughts, self-doubt, anxiety, closing myself off to others. What did I gain from that? Nothing at all. Just lost time.

Today I will try to being a path of gratitude and perspective. I cannot base my happiness on my current situation. I need to appreciate everyday as it is, not regretting the past or worrying about the future. I need to focus my energy into the things I can improve on and control, my work, the gym, building friendships, my relationships etc.

I'm so sick and tired of myself. I just don't understand why am I not taking actions in life to improve my life. It seems like I'm just living a meaningless life, where I can't find any enthusiasm optimistica. It's always ""sighs"" feeling whenever I even try to think of doing something. 
Often times I just feel like ""just do it"" but I'm making it so hard and complicated. Im repeating 2023 in 2024 and I feel this heavy burden like I just can't let this keep going anymore.

You already accepted failure and aren't doing anything to change. If I just keep going this way, then history will repeat year after year. I wanna get out of my head. I want to change my mindset. I have too and need too change. I told myself I want to start driving so I could become more independent. So I can go college in campus and find jobs that are far. I haven't even worked last year because I've been fed up working dead end jobs near my area. All I worked is fast food and retail jobs.

What are some actionable steps to practice Stoicism?,"Recently I've been making a planned effort to study philosophy everyday, where previously I'd just passively consume information as my Youtube and Reddit algorithms put it in front of me. 

I've been primarily reading about Buddhism, and some Taoism as well. What I like about Buddhism, is that it is very clear about the steps you must go through in order to attain enlightenment. You must follow the Eightfold Path in order to attain enlightenment, and each step has very clear instructions. 

For example, Step 1 is to understand the Four Noble Truths, Step 2 is to internalize them and allow wholesome actions to naturally flow forth. Steps 3,4, and 5 precisely tell you what actions are wholesome or unwholesome and clear up any gray areas. Step 6 instructs you how to remove the 5 Hindrances (mindsets that hold you back from enlightenment), and cultivate the 7 factors of awakening (positive mental states). I haven't gotten to steps 7 and 8 in my studies yet, as step 6 is very dense with information. I'm getting this information via Ajahn Sona from this playlist of videos https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCXN1GlAupG0_DzIOFNrDSp0fTwTLkTxV&si=fiBpd9SM2c4m8XRA

I was wondering if Stoicism had similar actionable steps. I'm familiar with Memento Mori and the following quote from Meditations:

""[2.1] When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they cannot tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me.""

I was wondering if you know of any other actionable steps that can be taken in Stoicism, like there is in Buddhism. 

Also, from what I understand, Stoicism seems to be a reactionary philosophy. It seems to suggest waiting until something offends us, then rationally choosing a reaction during the time between stimulus and response. Buddhism seems to be more proactive however, allowing me to exert energy in order to remove the 5 hindrances, and giving me a task of cultivating healthy mental states via the process of meditation and mindfulness/metacognition. What do you think about this interpretation?

I made a very similar post in the /r/Taoism if you'd be inclined to see their responses. I enjoy learning about Buddhism, Taoism, and Stoicism; they seem to have a lot of overlap. The answers from that subreddit may potentially help you develop a deeper understanding of Stoicism if you're so inclined.",Stoicism,1705605483.0,t3_199y6r7,0.4,0
"'[...] Certainly it has made the inferior in the interests of the superior and has connected the superior one with another. You see how it has subordinated, co-ordinated, and allotted to each its due and brought the ruling creatures into agreement one with another.' Book 5, Paragraph 30, Meditations","
Adding:

'[...] For it has been proved long ago that we are born for fellowship; or was it not plain that the inferior creatures are in the interests of the superior, the superior of one another? But the animate are superior to the inanimate and the reasoning to the merely animate.' (Book 5, Paragraph 16, Meditations)

-----------------------------------------------------------

Hey, this quote(s) left a big questionmark on my mind, so I'm here for some input to understand them correctly. I conclude I've got more then one question to ask as they built up on each other.

(1) It translates to me that the old stoics distinguish between valuable and less valuable people.

(2) If my first impression (1) is right, why do high valuable people and superior only be the interest of likewise people and the inferiorjust existng just for the earlier mentioned? Why is the superior not helping the inferior to rise or at least show a new way of being and try to practice it? It seems that inferiors are only in the equation to look up to the rational ones (At first without judging it, just what it seems objektive. Later on it seems arrogant.).

I guess it's the distinguish between people who serve stoicism no matter what stage there on and the other people. A second or more detailed guess is that they distinguish between those who think, act and behave for the community/social mind and those who lay on them because they don't bring something valuable into it.
(3) Am I even close with my guesses?


From actually looking in our society we indeed have people who think, act, behave, yeah work and live for the society and e.g. others who can't or simply don't bring that much value into it and need to rely on others help, get cure or a financial minimum (at least to live) etc. We could see them as 'less valuable' because of the different input we all put in the big pot. Also thinking of disabiltys some people experience. But everybody is gifted individually and although I see those more- or less-'valuable' people in society, I wouldn't morality-wise treat them less respectful or think of them like less of a human being. Indeed it is humanly.

I slightly remember (might remember wrong) that Seneca said that as a stoic and aiming for getting wise you need to sort of break contact with those who aren't on the same path. Like choosing not to deal with them.

Please correct me if wrong or missing anything.)

"What would be the Stoic approach to dating and finding love? Is it even worth me, as a man, trying my hand at dating?","Long story short: I’m 28 years old and have never been on a date, and thus never been in a relationship. I’ve never known love outside of that given by my parents. And I also never had friends growing up and thus spent the majority of my life alone. That was until recently when I finally managed to acquire two genuine friends. 

To put it simply, I’m lonely. I feel an emptiness inside me that no amount of Lexapro (antidepressant medication) can seem to fix. I want the feeling of waking up next to someone I love and feeling genuinely happy. But I also know how hard it is for men in our day and age to find romance/love and how dating apps can be like bottomless pits of swiping over and over again, just hoping and praying one girl out of 100 will match with you. But even then, there’s a good chance she’ll ghost you just because. It all seems so hopeless. 

But, I also know the Stoics would say things like “Your happiness should not be dependent on the people in your life and the value you place on them”. And I just don’t know how to reconcile the Stoic philosophy and finding true inner peace and tranquility with my desires I want out of life and not wanting to be lonely anymore.",Stoicism,1705586183.0,t3_199qp1t,0.86,48

I need a stoic solution on how to deal with an issue in my relationship.,"Hi, my (F30) husband (M32) have different levels of affection whereby I am more affectionate and love spending quality time, hugs, kisses, asking about his day etc whereas this doesn't seem to occur to him naturally. Therefore I always feel deprived of affection and acknowledgement very often. It's as simple as not being acknowledged when I walk into the house after a workday, barely even looks in my direction and I have to initiate a Hi let alone a kiss. When I initiate he does respond but this is wearing on me since it would be nice to have that without asking for it. I have expressed this multiple times but he changes for awhile and goes back to old patterns soon after. I'm beginning to grow resentful especially because this last week and part of this week I have really struggled mentally and would have loved a genuine ""How was your day today?"". I would also love hearing ""I love you"" without having to say it first. So I decided to mirror his behaviour and not Initiate any of my usual affection and conversation, we've been quiet for 2 days. I wonder if I should focus on controlling my own actions as recommended by stoicism and maybe seek the affection elsewhere? Or maybe not give affection either so that I don't feel short changed and hence protect my peace of mind. His family is the same way, naturally dull and cold and have an almost professional relationship unlike mine that is very much affectionate hence my personality.

What’s the point,"Hey everyone. I got into stoicism about a year ago while I was having some family problems and the philosophy helped me get through those times. 

Because of Marcus Aurelius I started reflecting on my death a lot more. Originally this was helpful as it helped me put a lot of things into perspective. I realised how temporary my problems were.

However I’ve been thinking about death almost all the time for the past few weeks to the point where I don’t see the point in most things. I’m in college and used to be really focussed on my career and working out but now I feel like why should I bother being the best version of myself or strive towards being virtuous if it’s so temporary. Does it matter if I live according to my nature if I’m gonna be dead anyway? The advice I’ve gotten is to be good for the people around me but even their lives seem so temporary.

Practical advice to not dwell/feel guilt on past mistakes/regret,"When you make mistakes, big ones. Ones that might change the trajectory of your life. It's hard not to dwell on them.

It's very easy for me spiral into overthinking mistakes. Part of it is due to my perfectionist personality. The past few years for me have been rough to say the least. At times very low, but at times I felt happy and found joy in life.

Like I said, I often spiral into deep places of guilt at what I've done, anger at myself, anxiety towards the future, and so much regret that I just feel hopeless towards life. How can I help myself when this is happening.

Some things I try to tell myself.

\- Comparison is useless, I will always hurt myself looking for what I lack in others.

\- The only good a mistake can serve is a lesson, other than that it's just needless suffering

\- If my mistake does cost me now or in the future, than that is something I have to deal with, suffering in my mind is just extra punishment",Stoicism,1705552475.0,t3_199hmtv,0.9,17

"Hell, Camus, and the Ancient Stoics","I have a thought experiment and a question for y'all. 

**(The setup)**

Imagine that on the Day of Judgement, God, the Christian god, banishes the ancient Stoics to Hell. 

There are many Christian views on Hell, but let's suppose this Hell is an *inescapable*, *eternal* stream of *torment*. 

I know there are many Christians on this sub. Out of respect for their faith, let's not argue but simply suppose that the Ancient Stoics come to the conclusion that the Christian God is unjustful and thus not worthy of worship. Their claim is that an inescapable, eternal stream of torment is unjustifiable and inappropriate for punishment for whatever ""sins"" they committed in their finite lifetimes. If humans can forgive their persuctors, they reason, then surely the ""all loving"" Christian God can forgive. And if humans have the instinct to correct, rather than just punish, bad behavior , surely the ""all loving"" Christian God would eventual seize the torment so that people could reintegrate back into a relationship with God. 

**(The question)**

What attitude would the Ancient Stoics take in Hell? How would they handle themselves in Hell?

To be clear, this is just speculation. I speculate the Stoics would forgive the Christian God. I would imagine them like Camus said of Sisyphus:  *One must imagine Sisyphus happy*

And I would even imagine Epictutus whispering to himself:

> To incarceration. Do I have to complain about it? To exile. Is there anyone stopping me from going with a smile, joyful and content? ... **You'll shackle my leg, but not even Zeus can conquer my will.** 'I'll throw you in prison. My body. 'I'll cut off your head? Well, have you ever heard me suggest that I'm unique in having a non-detachable head?

So, what do you think? How would the Stoic handle themselves?",Stoicism,1705548648.0,t3_199gema,0.55,1

Example of daily Journaling,"Today at the grocery someone was backing out of a spot. I didn't see them until I was already behind them. I just kept driving because legally I had the right away. They laid on their horn. Now I didnt get mad and I didn't get worked up. I did get out of the car after parking knowing that they were about to drive past. I didn't want to seem like I was hiding or avoiding them as im trying to become more comfortable facing conflict, this is something ive struggled with my entire life. I also got out with a smile waved and started to say sorry. But the guy cut me off with some attitude ""boy you don't know how to drive do you"" (SO MEAN RIGHT?!🤣) here is were I lost sight. I got a annoyed and said something about how I was going to apologize but if he wants to be an ass we can be assholes. I could of just said. You know what man. Im sorry. In my defense me and my wife were talking about how she is currently having a miscarriage and I haven't really had a chance to grief and process the loss. So my emotions might of been a little off. 

In this situation there are a few things I could of done better. 1. Not let his comment annoy me into getting into a play ground argument. If he's not physically coming at me there is no reason to engage and 'save face'. Just apologize and move on with life.
2. I got a little bit of an adrenaline dump from arguing with him. This tells me I was looking into the future and the possibility of a fight from having words with him. If words are to be had then have them and be in that moment at that time and only get ready for a fight if a fight is about to happen. ""I have to die. If it is now, well then I'll die now. If it is later then now I will take my lunch"" 
3. After I walked away and into the store I was still worked up and it took some time to really come down and let go. I was still replaying the moment in my head. But not in a ""could I have done that better way"" in a ""I could of said this, that dude was such an asshole, I would of kicked that dudes ass"" way.  In this moment I was ""suffering more in my mind then in reality""

Stoicism is incredible !,"Hey friends, I didn't imagine that a philosophy could impact me so much in such a short amount of time. It's just incredible.

I discovered Stoicism recently, and to be honest, I didn't believe much in the effect. Out of curiosity, I started delving deeper, and just wow, it resonated so much with me and really improved my mind. I found peace with myself. The idea that life is about balance; I found that controlling your actions is not achieved by fighting your emotions, but by accepting your emotions at their fullest and letting them express inside you. Little by little, I began to feel a kind of moment where you face your mind, and you see your feelings taking over. With time, I feel more and more able to see clearer and take better decisions and I'll be happy to learn more.

"I do not recommend ""How to be a Stoic"" by Massimo Pigliucci","When I started this book, I expected a philosophical manual on Stoicism, at the end of a most underwhelming read however, what was delivered was a poorly written and thinly disguised self-help book.

&#x200B;

It started out decently enough though, a brief history of the philosophy, followed by an examination of its main tenets. All the good in it was contained in the first 20% and even then there were traces of the navel-gazing to come. Everything after... shockingly poor.

&#x200B;

Never have I seen an author miss the mark so much. The decision to write this in first-person only served to show how flawed the author is, all of his biases and prejudices were laid bare. A better title for this book should have been ""How to be Massimo Pigliucci"", every chapter was littered with entirely boring and braggadocios anecdotes of a man who evidently thinks himself an embodiment of humility, modesty and fine character. You would see interesting chapter titles that ended up being neither informative or thought-provoking, for someone who never missed the opportunity to tell the reader how non-religious he is, the whole book had an air of boring preachiness about it.

Scary lawyer letter,"Everyone probably heard about these letters, knows someone who received them, or received them themselves. Lawyers keep sending these letters because they are effective. People get scared and pay even if they have no obligation. For example, in some countries, media companies hire lawyers to send these letters to people who pirate movies, demanding payment to avoid a lawsuit.

From a Stoic perspective, these letters are ink on paper - nothing more. It's up to you to decide what you think and what you do. If you feel anxious, the letter is not causing it. It's your brain that is taking the bait. 

I never cared about these letters, but it's always a few days of drama when a household member picks them up from a mailbox. Since they don't understand the law, they already imagine someone coming to our house and taking possession of our household items because of ""debt"" or me ending up in jail for years.

Don't suffer imagined troubles. Seneca said, ""we suffer more in imagination than in reality.""

How to deal with Anger and Discomfort during banter among friends.,"I have this group of friends that I hang out with sometimes. Where, I don't feel like I am being myself when I am with them. Sometimes they throw banter at me and laugh. I initially took it lightly. But when they repeatedly use the same joke (which is not even funny tbh), I get irritated and angry. I don't show it but I feel like my ego is getting shattered. I usually want to create an impression about myself where I want to be treated with respect. I respect others too. But, here I feel like that impression is getting shattered when my legs are being pulled.

How to turn an obstacle into an opportunity?,"I am struggling to find the opportunity in the obstacle. This is where I call upon your help. Please be gentle, I am a sad raccoon 🦝

Three years ago, I lost my job caring for a sick previously estranged family member (dementia and alcoholism-based physical complications). I had no support from anyone so I fell into debt paying bills and rent and groceries. One family member stepped in, making all sorts of  allegations and being outright abusive in a bid to get total control of my dad's finances. I was proven innocent again and again, but nonetheless it all took a terrible mental toll and I eventually had to step back for my own health.  The whole situation lasted around three years and every moment was awful. I managed to find another job within a few months of losing my last, which I dislike and pays badly.

I'm trying to move past it all but with the debt at £12,000 (I pay it down and it just gets bigger every year at 47% interest) I'm finding it hard. I've been job hunting for a better salary to outpace the interest as I'm currently underpaid where I am but I've had terrible luck. 

I was offered one job after around seven interviews, for example, then the offer was rescinded because the company decided to freeze all hiring. Situations like this have happened repeatedly, where I'm unsure how my actions could have created a better outcome and I'm doing everything ""right"" on the surface. I have given up on job hunting for now and am trying to accept and be grateful for the job I do have.

This has increased the sense of desperation, as the job I lost caring for my father was awesome and paid well, and I feel like I'm not going to be able to get back to that again. This increases my resentment towards the situation, like it's a reminder how many steps back it's pushed me.  

I am also very physically unwell, recovering from three years worth of burnout, but I cannot take any significant amount of time off because my company does not pay sick pay. In fact, they threatened to fire me if I took more than a fortnight off. I exercise a lot, take medication and eat healthily but am so very, very weary and generally sad all the time. 

I am also unable to get the medication that would help my newly diagnosed disability, which apparently compounded the stress of caring for my dad, due to a long waiting list in my country's healthcare system. 

I think about all I did caring for my dad, all the things I fixed for him, like chasing down scammers to get back money and using that to organise his care, and how it helped him and the family member that savagely betrayed me but just set me back so far. 

What opportunity can I find in this adversity? 

I regret doing it. My dad abandoned me as a child and it was foolish of me to help him.  My friends say I should be proud of helping him when he was so terrible to me but I don't really see what the virtue in that is. I mostly feel stupid. I'm struggling to see what I can learn from this or how it has been anything other than a a series of cruel circumstances drawn yet again from having an abusive, screwed up family. Other than, maybe, I should have just left him to die. But that doesn't feel right at all. But perhaps it is? Perhaps that is the opportunity? Or is just plain acceptance the way forward? 

So please, help me find the silver lining, the opportunity in the obstacle, so to speak. I feel that if I can extract meaning from it I can move in. It's been a year since I stepped back from the majority of my duties, and I still cause myself suffering over it all the time. 

I'd like to cultivate peace and moving on from it rather than the daily resentment, grief, self-hatred and desperation. I know some of this is my C-PTSD and how it all triggered a lot of trauma, but a lot, honestly, feels spiritual and mental, like I can't make my world right after it.

I've been practising Stoicism alongside general philosophy and meditation for awhile. I also go to weekly therapy and exercise for up to two hours daily for fitness and anger processing.

SouthAsian Narc mother causing me issues that directly impact my life and beyond my control. How to proceed?,"My SouthAsian narc mother is making my life hell from far away in another country.

Problem: Now she is spreading rumours about me and my partner about me being abused by him. Solution - we can ignore it as it does not impact my life directly. 

Problem: She is calling me every moment, bombarding me with messages which is literally causing me to physically hyperventilate and increased blood pressure. Solution - i can block them on phone after writing a short message not to call me so that they don't think I am dead.  

Problem: She may come to my place unannounced and me being unprepared. Now this does directly impact me. I do not know how to deal with this if she suddenly appears at my door. Solution? - I take her to an airbnb or dump her with my potential mother in law so she can diffuse the tension for me. This is just one idea.

An Unorthodox Method To Deal With Anxiety,"In this post, I will present what I consider to be an unorthodox method of dealing with anxiety and what I will dare to call, anxious thinking. 

**Cause**

It is possible that, at this moment, you are going through a particularly tense, difficult, or painful situation in your life and think that your anxiety is the direct, natural consequence of events in your social, family, or work environment.

However, the cause of your anxiety is not found in what you are currently experiencing; instead, it lies in the future that you believe you will have to face. Your mind is filled with repetitive thoughts about imaginary scenarios in which that catastrophic future will occur.

What causes your anxiety is not a specific situation you are experiencing but the imagination of something much worse, which your mind categorically classifies as unbearable.

**The Method**

How to deal, then, with anxious thinking? How to overcome chaotic, repetitive thoughts in an imaginary scenario that torments us? The method I propose is to imagine the worst, to think about the scenario that torments you.

I dare to classify this method as unorthodox because it goes against what we intuitively would like to do to avoid anxiety: avoid thinking about what we fear. However, analogues of this method can be found even in various ancient philosophies, among which Stoicism is no exception.

The idea is to observe the same imaginary scenarios that generate anxiety, but really analyze them, view them as another possible option calmly, rather than as an event that will inevitably occur in a way that is categorically incompatible with our existence. The reason these thoughts obsessively cause us anxiety is that our mind unquestionably classifies them as unbearable.

Likewise, just thinking about them calmly is a very powerful weapon to drive away anxiety. We must remember that, evolutionarily, the goal of these repetitive thoughts is to prepare us for plausible future scenarios and obtain useful intuitions about how to act in response to them.

However, individuals experiencing anxious thinking are unable to use imagination as a source of knowledge, only as a source of fear. When possible worrying scenarios appear in their minds, the anxious individual gets stuck in them, going round and round through chaotic, repetitive thoughts.

But if, following the original evolutionary objective of these thoughts, we delve into the imagination of possible solutions, our thoughts will not generate the same anxiety. By doing this, we put ourselves in a situation where we internalize them as past events that have already occurred.

Seeing them through this key is much simpler because it is not difficult to face a past situation, which, like any other, is just a fact against which we will have to act.",Stoicism,1705424826.0,t3_1987x3d,0.91,9
Dr. Michael Sugrue has died.,"According to his official YouTube channel, Dr. Michael Sugrue has died. He loved philosophy, and I am sure that many new Stoics have been introduced to Stoicism by his amazing lecture on Marcus Aurelius ([here](https://youtu.be/Auuk1y4DRgk?si=Lja1PLJpc4Ig4Zur)) which I highly recommend (I listen to it quite often).

How do I have more patience with my mother ?,"I’m sorry to use internet terms but, she’s a Karen, There’s no better way to tell it

She’s always talking loudly, complaining about everything, treating her own mom like garbage, always fat shaming me, she doesn’t accept that I’m bisexual (I had to break up with a great guy because of her), she’s a hypocrite, an alcoholic, she doesn’t listen to my arguments, she never listens to me, she makes it super clear that she wanted another son who would follow everything that she wants, everything needs to be her way, she doesn’t respect my boundaries and limitations, is always calling me weird even tho my psychiatrist told to her face that’s likely that I’m on the autistic spectrum, she’s always hammering in that I didn’t get my driver’s license after failing the exam for the first time, she doesn’t want to pay for my medications, she forced me to go to a college that I don’t like (she literally matriculated me there without my consent), she’s always doing things behind my back and telling me moments prior until the event happens, making me super anxious, she thinks that I’m faking being depressed and anxious….

Next year I’m graduating from college and I will be able to live my own life but I still need to get through this year 

I really didn’t want to feel this way about her, none of my friends have issues with their parents, and I do t like to hold grudges against anyone, not even those who hurt me, Marco Aurelius told that people are meant to cooperate with one another and that hate and rivalry are unnatural but I’m tired of trying to change her",Stoicism,1705417677.0,t3_19850pr,0.5,0

On top of that, it had been a personally rough year for me and my family. Needless to say, I was nervous. 

I had no reason to be. His review overall was very positive. I learned a lot about his point of view on the friction we’ve had and took away some pointers. I don’t agree with all of his feedback, but I can’t deny that it was fairly delivered with adequate detail.

I’m having a hard time following the temperance virtue.,"I’m 24 years old and still don’t have self control over my pleasures, I binge eat like an animal, spend my time on YouTube and masturbate over 5x a day

I’ve unsubscribed from every porn related subreddit and deleted my safari history so whenever I google something it will not appear but it did not work for too long either

The same with my YouTube I try to distract myself with other things such as books and movies just to have a better sense of time expended per entertainment, I can finish 1-2 chapters or watch a movie in 1-2 hours each and have the rest of my day off instead of watching multiple videos of 50 minutes a day

I can't go on with my life like this.,"Hey.

​

Hemorrhoids have sucked the joy out of my life for the last 2 years.

I'm sitting at home, crying because I just see no light at the end of the tunnel.

I'm a very upbeat person. Always trying to see the positive. But I feel so helpless here.

​

I'm a 31 year old, (otherwise) fit male.

​

Every day I find myself anxious or uncomfortable about the most mundane things.

Sitting on the subway. Driving a car. Walking. I lost my ability to relax.

​

I constantly feel my hems and they get worse during the day. Every evening I wish

my life was different. I envy every person that doesn't have to deal with this.

I love to do a lot of sports. Now I'm too scared to do hard exercise.

I don't do any activity that could lead to worse Hemis (bouldern, skiing, running, lifting). I love to do all of those things.

​

I do everything in the book that should help or prevent them.

Eat a lot of fiber, drink enough water, NEVER EVER STRAIN. Nothing helps.

​

My therapy so far:

​

Got hemorrhoids in early 2021. Got first banding in August 2021.

Got another banding. Got sclerotherapy. Got Raphaelo radiofrequency treatment.

Tried alternative healing as well (TCM etc.)

​

They were Grade 2. Now grade one, but there is still CONSTANT pressure on my fucking anus.

​

I also hate thinking about them so much. But I can't help it. It's almost an intrusive thought at this point to think about them. Even they are ""only"" grade 1 atm I can feel them every day, all the time.

​

Sometimes I have the thought, that my intrusive thinking about them makes them worse or that they would go away with me doing it. But it's impossible not to think about them. And they are connected to so much anxiety and shame. It's such a downward spiral thought process as well.

​

I want to know if I can get rid of them again in my life. But all the posts about surgery also seem horrible. And I'm not sure you could do that for grade 1-2 hemorrhoids.

I don't want to lose hope that my body can regain balance.

​

I just wanted to post it here because I had to get it out of my head.....

​

Thank you for reading.

"Kahneman and Klein (2009) stated, “a psychology of judgment and decision making that ignores intuitive skill is seriously blinkered” (p. 525).","As far as I know, Stoicism advises people to avoid making decisions or judgments by relying on their intuition or first impression. What do you guys think about the studies done on decision-making, that is on system 1 and system 2 thinking. These studies say that they both have a place in making optimal decisions. I am not talking about our brain's ability to compute the speed and angle of a ball that we can catch with the right timing. I am talking about decisions to let's say let our anger out in a situation to set some boundaries or protect ourselves without rationalising it before doing so.

How I discovered Stoicism. How did you guys discover Stoicism?,"Technically there are a wide range of things that lead to my discovery and pursuit of Stoicism, but the main two reasons were: Breakup and David Goggins. Before I continue, **I know that David Goggins is not a Stoic.**

I read both of his books: “*Can’t Hurt Me*” and “*Never Finished*”, and it was extremely inspiring. He has been through *so much* hardship in his life that if he were to just completely fail in his life, no one would blame him. They’d excuse it under the premise that because of all the hardship he’s been through, it’s expected for him to fail. Instead of allowing the hardship to ruin the rest of his life, he used it as fuel and became a Navy Seal, an ultra-marathon runner, completed a bunch of Iron-mans, and a fucking author despite his severe learning disability. I’ve also been through much hardship; abuse (physical and sexual), homelessness, and a lot more which I will not list because…honestly it just feels odd listing it all. From his books, I learned a key lesson: It’s not what happens to you that matters, but who you are despite everything that matters.

Fast forward to the breakup, I got cheated on, discovered it was going on for a while yadda yadda. I was angry, felt humiliated, sad, hurt, but from what I learned, I decided that I can either let this break me, or I can use this situation as a challenge to maintain my character and not allow this situation to destroy me. So, I took on the challenge. Instead of acting out of anger, I had a conversation with them in order to gain understanding, I forgave them (after ending the relationship of course), and treated them with as much respect and kindness as I would to anyone else despite what they did to me, with no desire to receive any of that back. Day after day of doing this, I found myself feeling extremely happy and honestly excited. I was like “You’re telling me that a 5 year relationship just ended from cheating, and I can be THIS GOOD? Even after everything that happened?” Yes, those were sad times, but the fact that I maintained and even improved my character despite that is something that will stick with me forever. 

So, I decided to continue with the momentum by learning even more. I thought if this is something I was able to learn on my own, I can only imagine what I can learn from others. So I looked up “Books every man should read” on reddit, and found meditations. Then through meditations, I decided to join the Stoicism subreddit where I then found Epictetus’s Discourses, and the rest is history.",Stoicism,1705375683.0,t3_197sqog,0.63,2

Irony in morning meditation," Recently,  I stumbled upon stoicism by reading a couple books. I've struggled through much of my life looking for philosophy that matches what I believe. Stoicism feels like something I can really get behind. From my perspective there are a lot of truths to it. So I'm pretty excited to be apart of it and the community.

The reason I'm writing this post is to share my new experience. While reading has been a pleasure, I'm finding the actual practice difficult. Today was a perfect example. I spent so much time angry at every little life nuisance. While walking my dogs I was angry about the traffic and other people trying to use the sidewalk. I was acting surly. I've used Marcus Aurelious 's morning meditation to help deal with co workers and other people who stress me out. Yet I turn around and act the same way they do. In a sense it's kind of funny. Like going from hero to villain. What a fucking hypocrite.

**Resources**

We plan on following an average reading list for an undegraduate course in philosophy. We started with ""Think"" by Simon Blackburn, an introductory book into philosophy. If you don't have the resources, I will provide them.

**Schedule**

We meet once a week, on Sunday at 18 GMT. During these meetings we review and discuss our readings. Discussion questions on the topics at hand are be prepared beforehand, I usually use both human and AI inputs to write discussion questions but feel free to contribute in whatever way you want.

**Requisites**

* Passion. The books we are going to read are not exactly fun read if you don't like the subject matter. I've noticed that a significant amount of people get demoralized when they approach the text as they turn out differntly from they expected.
* Consistency. I plan on reading thirty-five to fifty pages a week (five to seven pages a day). It's not a huge time commitment but it is still a time commitment.
* I don't really care about age but I prefer people over 18 for this club.

After briefly reviewing some of the Tate “ideologies,” I’ve come to realize justice is an afterthought. 

Yes, I know. He’s a 17 year old boy. 17 year olds are selfish. I was at one point. However, it seems out of control now and I don’t know how to mentor him properly. 

I’m 33. He’s my half brother. Father is a single parent with 3 other half brothers to look out for. Very clear he received minimal discipline. 

I try my best to mentor the boys because my father needs the help. 

I’ve been away in the army for the better part of the 17 year olds life. I’m not worried, I don’t fear the outcome. I know it’s his choice. However, while he’s still in the house, I would like to make an impact because it’s very apparent that it will cause him hardship when he’s moved out. 

This kid is the “cock of the walk.”

Here’s a brief description. 

17 years old, 6’4”, 250 lbs, all state football, Jock, Smart. He proclaims he’s the Alpha of the school. I cringe just typing that sentence. 

Any advice welcome.




Edit: I see why people would construe my words as jealousy. I said I wasn’t going to go into the details because it’s a long list, here’s a recent example. 

Last month he stole one of my father’s credit cards and spent $3500 in 20 days before we saw the statement. He was going out and taking friends to nice dinners, Uber eats to school for lunch, bought a membership to a health club, buying clothes he didn’t need…

When confronted by my Father, he showed no remorse by saying he simply “needed money.” The only thing I’ve said to him was, “I’m disappointed in your actions.” He avoids me like the plague now.

As for the reason I bring up his physical attributes. My father is elderly. He can barely walk. He simply cannot discipline him due to my brothers size and mentality. It literally becomes a shoving match with my father ending up on the floor. It’s just a bad situation.",Stoicism,1705339910.0,t3_197efd1,0.91,469
Stoic advice on street fights,"24 M. Was physically assaulted by club staff (14 v/s 3 of us) 2 years ago. That has given me a great deal of PTSD.

I know the usual advice is to avoid physical fights. But if you’re having a confrontation with someone and they punch you first, what to do then? What if someone teases my sister or gf? What if they are being unnecessarily physically aggressive?

In such cases do I get away and call the authorities or fight?? It’s somewhat of a pride thing too. Running way from such situations feels weak and hurts my pride. 

Thinking about all this has given me great social anxiety. 

And yes, I am not afraid of getting beaten up. I don’t feel anxious in confrontations with known people. It’s only with strangers because there’s fear of death.

Meditations 5.5 for me is the definition of stoicism in a nutshell.,"“Thou sayest, Men cannot admire the sharpness of thy wits—Be it so: but there are many other things of which thou canst not say, I am not formed for them by nature. Show those qualities then which are altogether in thy power, sincerity, gravity, endurance of labour, aversion to pleasure, contentment with thy portion and with few things, benevolence, frankness, no love of superfluity, freedom from trifling, magnanimity. Dost thou not see how many qualities thou art immediately able to exhibit, in which there is no excuse of natural incapacity and unfitness, and yet thou still remainest voluntarily below the mark? or art thou compelled through being defectively furnished by nature to murmur, and to be stingy, and to flatter, and to find fault with thy poor body, and to try to please men, and to make great display, and to be so restless in thy mind? No by the gods: but thou mightest have been delivered from these things long ago. Only if in truth thou canst be charged with being rather slow and dull of comprehension, thou must exert thyself about this also, not neglecting it nor yet taking pleasure in thy dulness.”


It says that if we don’t have s desirable trait by nature alone that it’s in our power to gain it by dedication 

I want to be a kind and smart man, I’m kind by nature but not very smart (it’s obvious that a lot of factors come into play that Marcus Aurelius couldn’t have understood back then, such as in my case where I’m a neurodivergent person but that doesn’t mean that I can’t strive to learn more with a combination of meditation, therapy and discipline of study) 

The quote emphasises subjects of dedication, control of pleasure, acceptance of one’s luck (or the idea of fortuna), benevolence, etc 

It teaches us to not blame external factors and that the talent can be surpassed if the dedication overcomes the talent, as someone who have always compared myself with my peers and always thought that (i’m slow and there’s nothing that I can do to change it) this quote hit me like a brick to the head",Stoicism,1705261004.0,t3_196o3kq,0.89,13

My Mum has cancer.,"In December, Mum was diagnosed with a cyst. It was cancerous and thankfully, they said it was localised. Recently, she had her operation to remove it. They found that the cancer was worse than they anticipated and it was spreading and that chemo is needed. They are hopeful we will win.

I prepared myself mentally. I meditate every day, I felt the emotions, I reflected on the situation, tried to accept that there is a possibilty that mum could die. I gave my very best to my mum in terms of emotional support and care. I am her shield in life (domestic abuse) and emotionally she relies on me. I promised her that the only thing I can offer is my undying and committed support to her and that we will fight to the end.

Today I went to see her for the first time after the operation. Mentally I thought I was prepared. Nothing could have ever prepared me to see my beloved mother in pain, barely speaking and full of pipes and wires. It hit and cut deep on a very emotional level.

I started to cry silently. No one wants to see their mother like this. Somehow the Stoic training kicked in. I felt myself thinking: I am a human being, it is ok to cry in a situation like this and I am feeling my emotions. It is ok. Emotions must be expressed. This is not within my control and I am operating well in the things I can control, that is my mind and actions. 

I stayed there till visiting hours were over, made sure she was comfortable, and left.

As much as I like reading and learning Stoicism, I think the biggest teacher of Stoicism is life. This terrible situation is totally out of my control, rest for my little personal actions. We have a long road ahead, but I believe with a good mindset, I will be able to navigate the stormy seas that are ahead while supporting mother.

I am sorry if this may sound like humble brag. It is just me expressing my emotions on the Stoic subreddit, where experiences like these remind me how much I still have to learn.",Stoicism,1705242563.0,t3_196h2vx,0.97,184

How would a stoic stop pineing over a Woman?,"

I made it clear, that if she should what I would call a 'negative result' then I would do everything in my power to keep our relationship the same: friends. (Because I truly respect this woman.)I want her to feel guilt free and, if possible flattered by my affection. This I achieved - I believe. But now, I have confessed, and unfortunately said negative result has arrived I need help on thworting how I pine for her, at least physically.

Stoic boot camp?,"Hello

I got an idea of the basic stoic theory and practises, but I find it quite difficult to get it ""under my skin"". 

Is there a boot camp or other similar venue somewhere in the world where students of stoicism for 1-2 weeks meet to discus the practical matters and live stoicly under the guidance of a competent instructor? Not unlike how things went about at the stoa poikile in Athens.

"How can I keep out all desires out of my mind, when its also my duty to push myself to work hard enough to provide for my family","I am always in a twist and turn between two career, one is high risk, high rewards, another is low risk, good rewards but with hell lot of hardwork.

I saw a post here a short while ago about how Marcus Aurelius fed people to animals, and what that says about the credibility of his Meditations.  I don't know what the exact context was of my post title when he wrote it, but as I reflect on it, I am taking everything I have written here into consideration. 

Also, I try to praise loudly and criticize quietly, but I Still critize, blame people when I don't get what i want from them, especially if they've been reliable in the past. It's the inconsistency of people that gets to me alittle, because even though I am not perfect in my interactions with people, I prioritize being consistent(although it's out of my hands how people perceive my consistency.) So whenever i catch myself mentally blaming someone, I lean into it, but I ""level"" myself by adding to that mentally placating the person, or adding to that the mental equivalent of being physiologically distracted. Non of these is exactly in Stoicism(because non of those involves being super logical), but they are in a form of therapy I've found useful. And yes, I do know how important being logical about everything is, how useful logic is, and how indispensable it is to the life I am trying to live.

"""What should be done?"" My thoughts on this","Since I was little I've always been very inspired by history, and I've always wanted to 'make a difference', I guess is a good way of putting it. In short, I wanted to no longer be an NPC in the world, and today I see that things are a little more complicated, I think today I understand that this is something that we all try to do, and that perhaps this is what makes us part of the whole , we all want to be different and that's something that makes us equal, I think. Anyway, I always had this desire to find something that would make me do something for the world, not caring about fame or anything like that, but just to know that I contributed a little to the future of humanity, something like Newton's contributions to Physics, a subject that I have always loved. A little because of this, I decided to start a physics course at university, with the childhood dream that it would be easy to achieve something of this magnitude, but then I was faced with the fact that maybe I didn't like physics that much to dedicate myself to it. an entire life. I mean, the more time passes, the more I realize that I'm not an academic. I love physics, but I also love many other things that take up my time and that I consider just as important. It's as if the side of me that wants to do something for the world conflicts with the side of me that just seeks my happiness. On the one hand, I fear spending my whole life searching in vain, and in the end realizing that I wasted my chances of enjoying everything I could. And on the other side, I fear reaching the end of my life, taking advantage of every opportunity to be happy, but having to carry the burden of feeling like I haven't achieved anything, of not having left anything useful behind, as if my existence as a human asked me to do something. Currently the answer I have to this dilemma is that, no one who really changed the world had the objective of 'changing the world', they had an insatiable passion for something, and leaving a legacy of that was just a consequence of that passion. It's like an eternal doubt, I want to fulfill a duty and not be selfish, at the same time that I can't say there is something, a passion, that makes me focus on it that much, because I love many things.

A work that I can use to draw a parallel about how I feel is the work of fiction and fantasy Fate Stay Night, more specifically the character Emiya Shirou. In short, and spoilers ahead, the game has 3 routes in which Shirou makes different decisions. In one of them, he decides to become a hero of justice, even though he knows all the bitterness that this path would bring, and the story really deals with that, it is a complete break with that hero stereotype, but Shirou still chooses to be, which I think it's very pretty. In another route, however, he decides to be the hero of just one person, Sakura, the girl he loves. In one route he decides to embrace his childish ideals in the name of a greater good, and in another he decides to embrace his own happiness. In both cases he decides to embrace this passion, and I feel exactly in the middle of it, remembering that it is just a parallel. Trying to be a 'normal' person or trying to be something more. I see possible regrets in both of them. I know there's no right answer, but I think I wanted to vent a little about this, and I wanted to know if you guys had any thoughts on this. It's something that scares me a little hehe, but I like to think about it",Stoicism,1705115413.0,t3_195dz3r,0.43,0
Feeling the weight of time: Struggling to find my path in mid20s,"




I didn't work the entire 2023 year and I don't even have any health insurance. The only thing I did was trying to complete classes for college. But I even missed two semesters because of personal problems and stuff. I'm also feeling lost in life despite being in mid-20s. I just can't seem to find my path in life like career wise. I feel like I'm too old for college especially going in university because it seems like time consuming and finically expensive. I'm currently in community college and they do offer various certification programs and even two year degree programs but I'm not not sure what to get into as Im worrying like stuff about Ai expanding then bunch of layoffs happened. I want to get in a career that will help in long run and be substantial. I'm just stuck in this rut for about a year and even this new year hasn't been to a great start. I just can't afford myself sitting at home doing nothing. I'm just allowing my mind and thoughts control me. I'm tired of this anxiety and fear. Not having understand of life makes me feel weak and overwhelmed. I'm lacking confidence I guess and I'm just trying to find my way out. I previously so far only have fast food and retail experience but because I'm not driving, I'm kinda in a tight spot like transportation is issue in my area so I even applied to remote jobs but obviously I have hard time finding too sighs. So I'm just in completely messed up spot in life right now. Don't understand what to pick and choose or what to do first or something. I even worry like the world is changing so fast and it's important to learn essential life skills like doing your taxes, understanding how the economy works and the direction it's going. Multiple online courses are there like courses, Udemy, Google certification, Microsoft and so on.",Stoicism,1705092794.0,t3_1955i8o,0.79,8
Struggling to connect with others - feel like I am repeating the same thing over and over again.,"Life seems to be a constant struggle. I feel like I am running around in circles, infinitely so. 

I have struggled with depression for a long time (and I also have Aspergers). My depression is kind of situational. If I have friends, work and things to do, it doesn’t emerge. But when I don’t, life doesn’t feel worth living. I take mediciation for it (and therapy) which has helped immensely, but I can’t help but think that I seem to be stuck in this cycle that I cannot seem to break out of. 

My depression led to me dropping out of high school. Despite this, I worked my ass off at home and made it to one of the best colleges in the country.

While I find it easy to make 1:1 connections with others,  I never seem to connect with groups or make a solid circle of friends. The 1:1 friendships I have are often really intense but for one reason or another they die out. And for really inexplicable reasons. Sometimes they will go back home, then when college starts they suddenly don’t want to talk much or hang out anymore. I don’t get it.

I graduated college with great academics but not much to show for it in the way of friendships. For career reasons, I decided to do a masters program at again one of the best colleges. But I seem to be struggling with the same problem. I can have great conversations with a lot of people. But I don’t have a group. And sometimes I’ll arrange things with people, but people have yet to invite me to anything, except for birthday parties. I want to be hanging out with people, going out, having a good time. Yet I seem to be alone on Friday night, again, while everyone else is doing exactly that. 

I can’t seem to break this cycle I seem to be stuck in. I think my Aspergers may be a part of why I can’t connect in the same way that others do, but I can’t seem to figure out what I’m doing wrong, even with therapy. I don’t know how much more of this I can take.",Stoicism,1705092228.0,t3_19559zv,0.5,0

[DISCUSSION] Investigating Anger is the answer,"Good morning Stoa, a few days ago I came here after I had an *incident*. I got angry and lost my temper.

It was very uncool of me, and that lead to a lot of introspection, analysis, reflections, writing, and research.  

Not only I have come to the realization that I was wrong, but that I have been wrong all my life.

I had the wrong belief systems and worldviews, which rendered my analysis of the situations faulty.

Regardless that I was wronged, I had no business at getting angry, let alone losing my temper. That is never the answer to anything. I had faulty belief systems.

I have reframed my thinking and my belief systems, thanks in partly to Stoicism.

Today I am a better man, I still have work to do to better myself, and I know that the episode was a tilting point in my life.

I thank this sub for providing me with great comments and continuing to provide a source of sanity.

How should you actually read Meditations?,"So long story short...I've been an admirer and reader of the Stoics, particularly Marcus Aurelius, for years. What I'm trying to do is to practice the virtues sufficiently that they become habit and second-nature to me - something that probably will take years if not decades to accomplish. It's a really difficult task and I've messed up (pretty badly) on multiple occasions.

And so I often ask myself the question ""How did \[insert Stoic\] do it?"" At least for Marcus Aurelius it seems part of the answer was keeping himself accountable with his personal journal - what we read as Meditations today. And Meditations is a beautiful book, just...I've found it really hard to read. The problem might be the version, I'm using the Hicks version, but it's always seemed like a collection impossibly difficult maxims that I could appreciate in a moment of serenity but not in a moment of crisis.

Is the problem the version I'm using? Am I studying Meditations wrong? Is it just my fault for being slow-witted? Any advice would be much appreciated.

Yeah it’s gonna be a depressive one

I’m 24 years old, neurodivergent, queer (and last year found out that I’m trans, something that my bigoted parents are surely going to love), I have been battling depression for more than 10 years, have binge eating disorder, social anxiety and generally feel like an outsider and that I’m wasting my life 

I live in Brazil and everything here is so loud and confusing and every day I need to deal with a bunch of Ignorant people 

I’m just tired, I’m almost a quarter of a century old and I’ve wasted my life up to this point,  I have no personal achievements, no driving license (I failed the exam), no romantic relationship (although I don’t really care about that just think that it would be nice), no discipline and don’t know how to have it 

Im going to finish college this year and I didn’t even picked what I wanted to graduate, my mom chose that I was gonna be a dentist behind my back without consulting me, and I really don’t want to be a dentist 

I’ve had my ups and downs during those years but they were mostly bad, I’ve cried for no reason during most of my days, have contemplated suicide in a lot of occasions and I’m generally just screaming in my mind “I WANT TO DIE WHAT AM I DOING HERE ?!?!” while looking calm on the outside

My wrath and the chaos inside me has wounded those around me, again. The woman I love is hurt, and scared, and the whole of it lies squarely at my feet. The shameful fallout is well deserved.

Help,"I got into stoicism last year after reading a book called: the little book of stoicism. It was quite helpful, but nonetheless 2023 was the hardest year of my life, I suffered severed anxiety and struggled a lot. The main reason being that I struggled to separate what was outside of my control. I tried journalling every day, meditating and therapy. It did not help, but I am going to keep trying as know it can be a powerful tool. 

Does anybody know what steps I can take to make stoicism a bigger part of my life in 2024, whether that be books, or daily exercises I can do to slowly build up this muscle, as I have always suffered for things that were not up to me, and I need to stop it. I want to improve myself and get better as it often times causes me unnecessary distress and pain.

"How Stoicism Helped Me Throughout the Years, Despite Key Misunderstandings","*I hope this little tale can serve as inspiration for those of you interested in Stoicism only as a shield and less so as a toolbox. A*s it turned out for me, it provided and even more powerful operating system.

&#x200B;

I first stumbled upon Stoicism in 2012 as a graduate. I read ""Letters from a Stoic"" as I imagine newly converted Christians read the Bible; quite literally and with great joy and fulfillment.

At the time, I was a young man who had listened to everything from Dan Pena, Joe Dispenza, and to some extent Tony Robbins, even though he always seemed too ""guru-ish"" for me to really believe in. Stoicism provided me with the operating system I needed at the time.

However, I mistook being stoic for not letting emotions get to me. This served me very well for years. I overcame one challenge after another, climbed the corporate ladder quickly, and moved all over Europe in search of additional personal and professional growth. By many metrics, I was a young successful man with everything ahead of me.

One day, I realized my current job and life situation were no longer challenging. Despite making good money, living in a safe and affluent city, and earning a decent amount while traveling often, I was bored. I needed action. So, I took the leap, leaving that job for another and moving once again to a different city in Europe.

It was shortly after making the decision to move again that I realized much of my boredom and lack of growth where I was actually had very little to do with my surroundings, and everything to do with myself. By, in a Stoic manner, turning off most of my emotions, both the highs and lows of my intense life felt bland.

Shortly after, I returned to Stoicism and this forum. I realized that Stoicism is really about accepting feelings and then ""applying"" Stoicism, instead of using it as a mental filter to mute feelings and numb sensations. At one point, I was afraid that this new approach would make me lose one of my strongest abilities in life: to endure hardship.

But, as it turns out, this new way of interpreting Stoicism, for me, provided an even more powerful operating system to tackle everyday life. I learned how to accept feelings, embrace them, and power through. The acceptance step became crucial, as it helped me feel pain, enabling fruitful reflection and therefore progress.

I hope this little tale can serve as inspiration for those of you interested in Stoicism only as a shield and less so as a toolbox. If possible, try to repeat my misstake :)",Stoicism,1704895967.0,t3_19396dw,0.93,12

The Jean Valjean problem. Does stoicism indeed say he should not steal bread?,"Wanted to raise this question after listening to a discussion on a podcast. I am having some issues with it, so I'm coining the phrase the Jean Valjean problem  


In Les Miserables, Jean Valjean steals bread and is cast into prison for it. He eventually escapes and becomes a better person. 


The problem for stoicism as I understand it is the theft part. I may not understand stoicism correctly here,  but I believe that since stoics state virtue is the highest goal, and that our own life is less important than this, stealing a loaf of bread to survive (assuming for the sake of argument it is a life and death situation,  no escaping the thought experiment by claiming another option like borrowing money to buy bread) is considered less virtuous than not stealing and succumbing to death. 


I am not sure if this is a correct interpretation,  but I cannot agree with it for 2 eeasons:


1) Life isn't worthless. The value of continuing life at the expense of stolen bread is worth it. The value of a life is more than a loaf of bread so even though theft is not virtuous, it is excusable in this situation. 


2) life is worthwhile specifically because permitting a life to continue,  even at the expense of virtue, means that the person can grow and become virtuous over time. They cannot do that if they are dead.

Seeking comfort after dog’s loss,"My childhood dog, best friend and only company has passed away after fighting tumours for last 4 months. I am 22. Yesterday was supposed to be a regular veterinary visit and schedule to remove one tumour. He was 12, turned it just 1 month ago and was a golden retriever. He had multiple tumours which were operated and taken out, but one kept coming for the third time. It was his 4th operation in 4 months. Last days he was not eating and drinking that much as his tumour was in his mouth and was bleeding and hurting him. He went to the car so happy, full of life. I knew that it would take him but not that quick. Vet took him to immediate operation as his tumour started bleeding heavily, and we were told to pick him up in few hours. Upon arriving, the vet said he removed it and that he is slowly waking up but still bleeding so he advises to leave him overnight. At 9PM we got a call that he passed away after failed reanimation. My world broke.

We didn’t properly said goodbye. I can’t believe that the last picture of him is from yesterday shortly before leaving. My family is broken too. What hurts me is that he died without us, after promising him that we will pick him up as usual. Last night was tough, barely slept at all. I am on and off from stoicism in last year, but I know core concepts and it helped me a little. We are to bury him tomorrow as we have to pick him up today. It shook me to my core as I remember passing of my grandpa which was a huge part of my life, let’s say the same way (without anyone, alone in hospital bed due to Covid).

how do I attain happiness in my routine and life?," I've recently reflected on what had brought me joy in the past, the current moment and also could in the future. This is a copy of my thoughts, and I'd love to hear other people's thoghts on it :)

so, how do I attain happiness in my daily routine and life? 

Everyone want to be happy, and there are different ways for people to achieve that, each person has their own way that they persue. Taking my mates for example, at least what I see on the outside, they occasionally go out to parties, get high and drink, eat junk food and those are usually their highlights of the day. 

But that's not what I truely enjoy doing. Literally today, had my first pizza in probably three years, and it was seriously pretty bad. The taste was actually aweful. I felt nauseous afterwards, and regardless if I had a group involvement in my class I would prefer to pick a different, more nutricous meal for lunchtime. Thinking back to when I had a streak of a couple of days of being active, excercising and eating enough nutricous food, I literally get a sense of freedom, acomplishment and expecially peace.  

This was one of the things that brings me back to my question: How do I find happiness and purpose? Since it doesn't seem like a reasonable option to have a completely concrete step-by-step plan to be happy, since things change and you need to adapt, but I am aware many perspectives, healthy and unhealthy, picking the option for delayed or instant gradification, and in the long run it's always better to opt for the delayed, healthy option. Just recently I've watched a video, it's blantly obvious but the things that you are doing now are not effecting you right now, but rather the things you did years, months, days prior do. And in reverse your future depends on what you literally do at the current moment.  

So how do I attain happiness in my routine and in life?  

I need to find a balance between work and life.  

Currently I need to get education going and persue the path of excellence in academics. Afterwards I will be able to have a job that is high paying, so I can do whatever I want, not be constrained by a lack of rescources. Of course not to forget that for long term happiness it's highly important to pick a job that you actually enjoy doing, possibly using the method of ikagai, and also considering your established type of intelligence that you were born with (reference from a podcast that robert freene was on and mentioned that matter in his book mastery, the types are: linguistic, logical-mathematical, inter/-arpersonal, naturalistic, musical, kinesthetic and spacial intelligence; source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/harvard-psychologist-types-of-intelligence-where-do-you-score-highest-in.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/harvard-psychologist-types-of-intelligence-where-do-you-score-highest-in.html) ) Additionally, reflecting on the chliche suggestion that you should be enjoying your teen years while you can (go out and party, get drunk, high, not care about what you fuel your body with, when you sleep, etc.) I personally don't consider that view of ""enjoying your young teens"" as true enjoyment.  

In the moment in which I reach the top of a mountain after a high hike, having delicous dinner after a long day, waking up for a tasty breakfast, the morning sky, the sunset, the sun rise, the colors that the sky can take during different hours of the day, the way clouds move though out atmosphere, the acomplishment when you start comprehending an interesting topic, having deeptalk with a friend, the butterflies that you suddenly get when seeing a certain someonehaving music literally run through your veins when inducing it or just listening; the flow when reading an incaptivating book, the adrenaline kick when doing some crazy activity, sights of cities, landmarks, nature, different cultures, architecture, languages, customs, fashion or just calm walks acompanied by your close ones or just just yourself; there are endless opportunities that are here to be discovered, literally endless.  

Drifting back to reality, above I've listed multiple examples of things, that some far have brought sincere joy to my life and contributed to my life's purpose. Ejoying existing while growing for the betterment of myself and humanity. Obviously those moments cannot, at the time that I'm writing this down, happen on a daily basis. Right now I am given the opportunity, all ressources necessary, to educate myself, get a job and open the door for many more occassions which will bring me joy. 

It's absolutely obligatory for me not to let into brainfog, to start neglecting my health and being able to enjoy the simplicity and beauty of raw nature due to my dopanime receptors (and just my physical and mental condition) be fried to the brim of exctintion. Not let myself forget the hidden dangers of instant gradification and get in a hellish loop that day by day would bring me closer to depression, anxiety, shame and even death.  

So how do I balance my work and free time in a sustainable, meaningful way? 

It is of significance to consider that laying out an unrealistic schedule of a self-improvement type of guru is not going to be beneficial because of multiple reasons. The motive of it isn't really wrong, but the execution is usually not backed by scientific proof, and a sense of purpose. Why do so many people fail their new years resulution? Quiet frankly, they are not thinking about both long and short term dradification. There needs to be a balanced amount of both, else (at least that's what it's been like for me) it's not maintainable. It's so simple to skip going to the gym and  just have that last junky snack, because it's so much easier to do so. Instead just show up to the gym, don't obligate yourself to do a full on three hour workout, seriously just show up and do the bare minimun. Only thrity minutes is totally enough. If you've done, and keep picking this option consistenly, then you can do whatever would please you afterwards. Usually when you've already brought yourself to start, show up for that half an hour, is what it needs to get the stone rolling for a more productive way of living. You will get endorphines by doing the sport, a happy hormone, and the meal after excersising always tastes better if youre slightly worn out.  

And if you consistenly repeat an effective, maintainable routine, you will eventually reach a point where you can do whatever, whenever, with the people you love. That doesn't mean you can't do those things in the process of getting there, it is of most significace that you incooperate enough healthy happiness boosting activities into your routine in order to be able to sustain the discipline. Because in words it's easier written than done, actually do the due paper, decline unhealthy habits, but it can be done. You need to reward youself with ""natural"" induced gradification (note: look these methods up, backed up science based evidence), self reflection, self awareness and a sense of purpose.  

It's impossible to summarrise how to have a sense of purpose briefly, but the main point is that every person has their own, evolving purpose/reason to live for. Since the world is evoling and so many things are out of my control, I rather focus on the things that are in my power, like picking to go on a peaceful walk, enjoy a couple minutes of chilling with my loving cat, etc, that give me some direction of purpose. Do things that are genuinly meaningful to me.  ",Stoicism,1704761683.0,t3_1921ix9,0.87,6

I had to struggle with anxiety for a long time also anxiety of dying so thats not new to me. I take sleep to seriously and cant fall asleep because i stress myself about sleeping. When i have nothing to do on the next day i can sleep perfectly but if something i classify as important which can also just be a birthday of a colleague in the evening i just cant fall asleep.

Looking forward to your advice. Thanks !",Stoicism,1704716191.0,t3_191jxi6,0.75,2

I am going through incredible pressure from my surroundings and the feeling of being stabbed in the back.," 

About a year ago, I started a project with a few friends at that time. We were just a branch of a larger project that someone initiated in the capital city. The completion of that project was supposed to bring benefits to all of us. Hoping for a positive outcome, I handed over complete control to my friend at that time. We went through a tough period together, working hard and under a lot of stress. I lost 5kg due to anxiety, and it also cost me a lot of money. The project was completed a few months ago. The people in charge in the capital city are now working and reaping the benefits. I waited for them to call me and offer something, a job or a way to earn money, because we went through all of that together. However, they never contacted me. Now I find out that all this time, they were communicating with my friend who was the coordinator for my area, but he pushed me aside and is collecting benefits for his closest circle of people and family. I am practically excluded from the story even though I did everything that everyone else did, even more. My family and friends ask me every day when something will come out of it, when I can expect something. Some people even have expectations that I can help them, even though I can't help myself. It's very difficult to be deceived and betrayed, especially in a small town. I don't know what to do; I don't have contact with people from the capital city. Also, I wouldn't want to confront my 'friend' because maybe something will come from him. Please advise me because I can't sleep at night, and I can't bear to see my sad parents because I was deceived in some way.""

Finding gratitude can be so difficult,"Gratitude can be so hard to find for my personality type. I’m a perfectionist, idealist, and can be vain and superficial.

It can be really easy for me to focus on the negative. Get angry/pitiful at myself, life, fate. And easy to look around me and wonder why I have to deal with issues that all these others don’t (of course they’re likely dealing with their own problems).

I’ve been quite depressed before and still struggle with bouts of anxiety, sadness. Objectively speaking, I’ve been blessed in many ways. But I think it’s easy to take things for granted. I mean in life an infinite amount of things could go wrong at anytime. Everything is truly fragile, and thinking about that, helps me gain some gratitude for all that I have, and all that hasn’t gone wrong.",Stoicism,1704701874.0,t3_191gbrg,0.91,9

[DISCUSSION] Do you think the world would be a better place if people relied more on rationality and less on their feelings?,"Today I was taking a Myers–Briggs test (I know its validity has now been questioned, but that's irrelevant to the scope of this post); and at one point I was presented this test:

Of course, I replied ""I agree 100%"", but it made me think of Stoicism and this sub.

What is the *""Stoic""* answer?

We know that the world runs mostly on emotionally-driven decisions, we see it every day; so is it *silly* to wish otherwise? Should we as Stoics be like Ninjas, not wishing that the world were different, but improvise, adapt, and overcome life's situations as they manifest themselves to us?

Recently been coming out and having difficult thoughts,"
I’ve been coming out and being more open about my sexuality but often times my thoughts are irrational and fear based ill think that the person is gonna spread this information or visualise them telling their friends and spouse. Obviously these are assumptions and not reality but my mind is so scared. Another example is recently I told my coworker about my sexuality and I was shaking and my mind was racing throughout the next few days, about whether they would tell others or fear of rejection. I come from a muslim family and they don’t know and alot of my fear stems from them finding out and selfishly I stay at home as a dependent and save money and plan to move once I graduate university. I know I am not my thoughts and these are learned patterns from suppressing myself since a child to try and appease others. As I was smacked as a kid for acting feminine I conformed.

For new Stoics...,"With the popularity of Stoicism, like from Ryan Holiday and Massimo Pigliucci. People new to Stoicism should learn that they are referred to as Modern Stoics, which is a secular part of Traditional Stoicism. They leave out the most important part of Traditional Stoicism, Providence, and living according to Nature. If you read Marcus, Seneca, and Epictetus, Nature is foundational and is the only way Stoicism truly works to reach eudaimonia or happiness. If you are serious about Stoicism, learn how the Stoics viewed everything from a cosmic standpoint. Without it's not true Tradition Stoicism as the ancients taught, it's a secular form.

"The Jedi code sounds like it was written by a stoic, and the Sith code a hedonist.","*There is no emotion, there is peace*.  

*There is no ignorance, there is knowledge.*  

*There is no passion, there is serenity.*  

*There is no chaos, there is harmony.*  

*There is no death, there is the Force.*  

The first line I’m not sure I completely agree with. There are things like rational joy, but in a broader sense I think stoics would at least agree in part. Emotions are contrived from our judgments, which are a construct. Inner peace though is a common stoic theme, and is the result of sound judgment, not false beliefs assented into emotion.

The second line reminds me of a theme in stoicism that the true stoic sage is never upset, because he only has knowledge. Socrates famously said “the only sin is ignorance”.  

The third line is another stoic tenant. Marcus Aurelius talks in the meditations often about avoiding passions as they can take away from your rationality and sound judgment. A good sound judgment and an understanding of nature, will result in a natural sense of serenity and joy.  

The fourth line is again, often brought up in stoicism. I interpret chaos here as “unnatural”. Everything is natural, therefore nothing can be unnatural or chaotic. Chaos is a perception. A vicious storm isn’t chaotic, it’s just a storm. A result of nature that brings harmony and balance.  

And finally the last line. I’m not precisely sure what metaphor is meant by *there is no death*, as there is of course death. Maybe they meant you ought not to fear death. Maybe they meant you never really die because you’re resorbed back into the force. And the force could be interpreted in stoic physics as *the logos* as the ancient philosophers say.  

With all that dissected here is the sith code by contrast. You can make your own interpretations, but I think it’s clear why this doctrine is adopted by “the baddies” in the Star Wars universe. It clearly leads to a troubled, never satisfied, self destructive, vice consuming soul.  

*Peace is a lie. There is only Passion.*  

*Through Passion, I gain Strength.*  

*Through Strength, I gain Power.*  

*Through Power, I gain Victory.*  

*Through Victory my chains are Broken.*  

*The Force shall free me.*

I've tried meditating on these thoughts for months, and although I've gotten much better at controlling my reaction, I still feel the initial reaction all the same.

How to reconcile Aurelius's murder of Christians with his Stoicism,"So I was telling someone the other day how much I loved Marcus Aurelius, and how much his ""Meditations"" meant to me, and what a cool philosopher he was, et al, and she said ""I used to love him, too.

I'll be honest, I had no idea about this, so I googled it, and she was more or less exactly correct.

"On Virtue, Asceticism and the Request for Help","Hi everyone

I would like to ask you what exercises you need to do in order to grow in virtue. I read Marcus Aurelius several times, but I abandoned it in favor of the diatribes and the encheiridiona of Epictetus. I also read Cicero, whom I like very much because of his understanding of virtue.

1 Specific question: what do you think about asceticism as a preferential good that purifies all vices from man? Such as laziness, lack of self-discipline, and so on. Of course, this serves as a preliminary stage, for it is known that the man who tilles the soil, has uprooted the weeds, cut the earth, and sows or plants, that is, develops virtues. That's not to say that he hasn't done it before, but that getting rid of the superfluous helps. What do you think? (P.S. I'm a fan of Cynic asceticism)

2  Can virtue be exercised and will it always be present until we neglect it? I'm afraid that virtue is only an exercise of judgments in the mind that we hold onto, and that when they are lacking, it turns out that there is no virtue and never has been? After all, if it turns out that Stoic virtue is just a matter of the mind, I think I'd rather have Cicero's teaching on virtue than the Greek masters.

3  Do you have any internships that you can recommend to me? The reason I'm asking you this is that I'd rather deal with practices than just theoretical scripts on a lot of websites. I believe I can learn a lot from you, so if you would like to share some advice with me, I will be happy to hear it.

Please be patient and understanding, I'm not even sure if I gave the right flair (I'm sorry if I chose the wrong one). I try to learn new things and analyze what I already know, whether what I knew was really right.

How to manage stress in gaming (and in general)?,"I'm a young man getting slowly into stoicism. It is like 4th day since i started reading about it more (I'm still in the middle of reading one of William B. Irvine's books, it's my first). I like playin a lot of dynamic, stressful games like e.g. ULTRAKILL. I think im playing rationally - trying some tactics, doing stuff to manage problems (prioritizing enemies, defending yourself etc.). Nontheless tend to feel a lot of stress. At first i was still raging, hitting my desk, but today i felt a bit of a progress - i was still very stressed, i sometimes felt angry, however i remained calm and ""took a deep breath"" and went ahead. It might be also be caused by the fact i'm at my grandma and i don't want to make noise.
This applies to even some activities. In fact, i feel stress rn writing this (dunno why exactly tho). After trying to imply Irvine's suggestions in my daily life i feel better - i usually felt like people want the worst for me and they treat me as someome worse. Nowadays i feel less affected, like i don't care. Only time i felt bad was when my friend called PlayStation 3 gay (yes, he has xbox lmao) as i have huge nostalgia for this console.

Hi Stoics! Lend me your ear a moment please!,"Hey guys. I feel the desire to be very detailed here but I’ll try to keep it short and hopefully not break any rules while I’m at it.

I am 40 years old and I’m about 3 years outside of deconstructing from a lifelong Baptist brainwa… I mean, faith. I had always butted heads with fellow Christians, I always felt like it was all pretty fake and vain, and I was one of those delirious young Christians who thought I had a special connection with God, a certain special empathy for other human beings or something.

Anyways, when I was 35, my left foot started going numb and I figured it was just a pinched nerve in my back. Fast forward 3 years and now the numbness spread to my whole body, and even neurologists at Cleveland Clinic can’t figure it out, and say it has to be something genetic. (This is where I could really ramble, so I’ll stop myself here).

This was the straw that broke the Camel’s back, this is what finally pushed me through deconstruction and take that terrifying leap of ironic faith. I read a few books like Leaving the Fold, Age of Reason, etc. A lot of books on buddhism were also helpful in learning to meditate, but I felt like it was flirting too much with religion.

Then I read Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations, and that was it. Lights out, this dude spoke the language of my very soul. I’m happy to have found Stoicism! My biggest problem is that I am still so very hung up on my anger and resentment towards Yahweh, its so bad that it colors almost all of my thoughts. I still feel like a dictator is lording over everything. I still mentally lash out at him in my darkest times, even though I know I’m screaming at the void.

So, long story short, how do I kick this Jesus habit? Thanks for reading and sorry if I offended anyone. That snarky, passive aggressiveness towards Christianity is THE very thing I’m trying to address.

Is this correct?,"So i have started studying stoicism and its been two months, and i have been journaling about a month of the thoughts am having daily and the judgements i pass onto things i try to examine those.

I won't go into much details and make this really long. Here's a brief context of the stuff that happened. Well i do corporate job and everyday we have requests which gets assigned to our team and whoever available senior will assign it to the resource who is available on that day. The problem is things get suddenly escalated to higher management and we need to complete those tasks ASAP.

What has happened one of the senior on my team assigned the request/task to me while i was on my week off. I got angry as to why she assigned the task but i did not confronted her because i was angry i just took the action just to remind her not to assign to someone who is in week off.

And i journaled the whole thing.

and it goes something like this.

Anger  
\------------------

An emotion which happens. When thare is Something unjust has happened.

Did that thing did unjust to me?

Well it was unjust. But let's not get into conclusion.

Let's think it this way.

Is assigning tasks is Something People Shouldn't do?Y  
es they should.

If they Should do then whom they should assign?  
The People who are available.

Now did she assign to Someone who was available on that day?  
NO .

I mean you do not serve food to a Person , who is not there to eat.

Then we know that you should assign the task to Someone who is available .

NOW

Is assigning task to Someone who is not available is an unjust act?

Its not an unjust act as she doesn't have knowledge as to who was available and who was not.

Afraid of how my family would react to my lack of beliefs,"Yeah that's basicallly it. In a nutshell, i was raised by a loving christian family and ended up becoming an atheist a year ago, without them knowing it. 
I love my family more than anything, and they help me a lot, my brother is like a father to me as he taught me a lot of the values i have today, in which some correlate to that of Stoicism.
But the problem is, i stopped believing in God. I am not seeking for religious advice or anything, because it just doesn't make sense to me in believing in a religion again, what i am struggling with is how to deal with it when it comes to my family. I know they would get sad and maybe even exclude me for it... I feel helpless because as far as i am concerned i am the only one in my family that doesn't believe in the religion and that makes me feel lonely and unmotivated.
Not only that, but oftentimes i feel like i am being too selfish, in the sense of ""They did everything to me and now you just leave everything"", specially towards my mom who struggled a lot to raise me.
Its been weeks i am dealing with this, and this questioning in my head is destroying me, i just can't work properly anymore with all of this.
I would like to know how me, as a someone who considers myself a stoic should deal with this, i even considered returning to the faith but i did that twice before and i relapsed back to atheism and i am afraid it could happen again

I am aware that Stoicism teaches that i should focus on what i can control, but since i am still underage, the only thing i can still control here is to pretend i am still a believer and attending the church with them.",Stoicism,1704546193.0,t3_18zzjzv,0.57,1
Grieving for the lost health,"I've had flu-like symptoms for six months. All kinds of physical effort, like walking or standing, feel horrible. This has led me to grieve for my health. I know every single human loses their health eventually. I had plans. I know everyone will have plans that will be cancelled permanently. What difference does it make if it happens now or in 40 years? If you have seen a day, you have seen them all. And I have experienced life already.
Some things have been harder than before for me lately, but what difference does hard or easy make? Why would an easy life be more valuable for me?
Truth is, I have no way of knowing how long all this will last for me. An even firmer truth is that this is all just the beginning. Losing health, among other things, is inevitable. Not just for me but for all. Why lament the natural state of life?

When is it okay to give unsolicited advice?,"Hello,

&#x200B;

I tried looking for a similar thread but found only posts talking about receiving unsolicited advice rather than giving it. So, I apologize if I'm retreading ground here.

&#x200B;

Basically though, I find my relationships with my friends suffer because I give off an aloof disposition (not on purpose). Many times my friends will bring up a problem they are having and I'm usually quiet. This is because I am worried about unsolicited advice or otherwise overstepping boundaries.

&#x200B;

I know it's quite okay to voice my opinion when explicitly asked, but find it harder to do so when my friends only imply they'd like advice. And often, I'm not even sure if that IS what they're implying.

&#x200B;

Because of this I think finding a deeper connection is sometimes difficult. Maybe I give off the vibe that I don't care, or perhaps it seems I am trying to change the subject outright.

&#x200B;

I also feel like I am denying my friends the decision as well. And I'm denying them a deeper insight into who I am that kind of prevents them from being comfortable around me. Maybe it seems like I'm hiding something or am coming off judgemental/stern.

&#x200B;

Well, what do you guys think? Am I caring too much what my friends think of me when I'm silent/reserved? Or do I just need to care more about authenticity? And when is proactively giving unsolicited advice acceptable?

&#x200B;

Would love to hear your thoughts on this. Thanks for your time and hope you're all well.

I am not new to Stoicism, I have read the classics and Pigliucci/Irvine; and I know that Stoicism is not about suppressing one's emotions.

I am posting here because the mods allow *""Seeking Stoic Advice""* posts, and because the comments here are the best quality comments across the entire Reddit ecosystem.

I am an old(er) Redditor and I have come a long way in my life; up until not long ago I thought that my life was pretty great, then the other day I lost my temper, something that had not happened in a very long time, and that I thought it was gone from my personality; but there I was. And it was ugly. I was ugly. Details withheld because they don't matter. Losing one's temper is uncalled for. Period.

But my reflections on what happens has led me to keen observation of my MO(s) and behavior, and I have come to the realization that:

1. I don't perform well in confrontations
2. I don't perform well under stress (stress real or imagined)
3. I play ""nice"" by default, but then turn ugly in situations #1 and #2 above.
4. So really, I am not that ""nice"".

I have read ""No More Mr Nice Guy"", as well as ""Not Nice"" and ""The Disease to Please"".

I started keeping a journal of the worst things that happen to me every day.,"About a week ago, I started keeping a little journal on my notes app of the worst things that happened to me each day.


It has helped me to change the way I view things and to realize just how insignificant most of the little daily “evils” I encounter are. 


This is my list from the last few days:


MONDAY: broke the yolk of the egg I was cooking.

TUESDAY: stepped on some dog poop barefoot.

WEDNESDAY: woke up at 3:30 because my son was crying, couldn’t go back to sleep.

THURSDAY: son went to bed about an hour later than usual. 


This has helped me to stop catastrophizing a ton. I was grumpy all week. And the worst thing that happened was I lost some sleep and some free time and also stepped in poo. If that’s the worst thing that happens this week, fortune’s smiling on me. 


Of course, if I were to get fired, or have a loved one die, it would definitely be worse than those things, but it would likely help me appreciate the good days all the more. 


Try giving it a shot, you’ll likely find that most troubles are not of dire consequence.

Edit to add: I know I should have a stoic journal where I write about how I respond to situations, work on virtues, etc. That being said, I don’t have a ton of time, and this is definitely a 30-second exercise rather than even five minutes",Stoicism,1704491909.0,t3_18ziu36,0.9,17

In love with an addict,"I'm in love with an addict, and I recently our relationship. When I broke up with him, I told him that part of the reason I was ending things was that I loved him too much to watch him kill himself. I was experiencing a lot of emotional distress because of his addiction and the way he was letting it impact his life and our relationship. He's a truly beautiful man, with a heart like none I've ever met and more love to give that I ever knew was possible, but was destroying his health and making it impossible to maintain a romantic relationship. 

From a Stoic perspective, I'm curious how to navigate our post-breakup friendship or whether I should not have one with him.  

Would growing as a Stoic mean learning to accept his self-destructive tendencies, and choose to serve as a support and friend if he chooses to get sober? Would it mean lovingly holding him accountable when he asks for support, and pointing out his patterns when he wants advice? 

Or would growing as a Stoic mean accepting that a leopard cannot change its spots, accepting that remaining in his life may be harming us both more than anything, and walking away? 

I will greatly appreciate any wisdom or experience this community has to share. ",Stoicism,1704486712.0,t3_18zgrmc,0.75,4

Virtue is the only good. Not the reach for contentment.

We embrace/love/wish for whatever happens/has happened and do not worry so much about how other's define/label that. We are happy in whatever is going on because what does that have to do with our character?

We deal with life as it happens, and do not lose our way. This includes opinions, authors and ""sophists"" we do not agree with. As Epictetus and Seneca both share, we can objectively describe a thing for what it is, we observe that a course called ""The Wealthy Stoic"" sounds like a contradiction and a confusion, but it isn't Stoic to then assign that value to the person beyond that observation.

This is Stoicism. If this doesn't feel right, then maybe there is a false impression somewhere in there to work through, or maybe this isn't the philosophy your nature is set to follow?

Lost,"

So right now I(20m) am in my third year of college and honestly I have no idea what I’m doing as in I don’t know what to do with my life. The bachelor that I’m studying for now is biology not because I’m necessarily interested in it but because engineering is too hard for me considering I suck at math and political science is also uninteresting to me.
All throughout my life/high school people would ask me what I was going to study and I would always tell them “I didn’t know” thinking that eventually I would know and I could answer their question and my question but here I am and I still don’t know. I haven’t found anything that really interests me nothing to the extent I could see myself devoting time and effort into it. I play a lot of video games but I don’t like it enough for me to learn how to make a game and I watch a lot of movies and TV shows, but don’t like them enough to pursue a career in cinema for example and to top it all off I’m not good at anything(no talent,no secret hobbies,nothing). I’m trying not to sound ungrateful, but to put it simply nothing is ever enough It all feels empty to me. People have told me that it’s normal to be directionless in this stage in life and I understand that but at the same time is very frustrating seeing my friends in college just knowing what they’re going to do with themselves whether it be veterinarians, lawyers, programmers you name it and I wish I could be like them. Needless to say, this is all having a negative affect on me is bad enough to go through life’s struggles, but I would say its worse when you don’t have a “why” to your struggles. I don’t feel like I’m asking for too much when it comes to just knowing what I should do. I’m not asking for that perfect dream job. All I want is to know what I should be doing with my life, something that I can see myself doing for a long time and be good at it, and get meaning from it but I don’t have that and I need help.

Question concerning the Stoic view on abuse from family.,"
I have some issues with a stoic view on abusive family and I’m curious how you all interpret the passage. 

Very quick backstory: After years of therapy I’ve stopped speaking with my mother due to narcissism and abuse. 

Stoicism has been one of the most valuable things in my life and has helped me through so much. I have been very troubled upon a re-reading of Epictetus and would love your interpretation.

“Duties are universally measured by relations. Is a man a father? The precept is to take care of him, to yield to him in all things, to submit when he is reproachful, when he inflicts blows. But suppose that he is a bad father. Were you then by nature made akin to a good father? No; but to a father. Does a brother wrong you? Maintain then your own position toward him, and do not examine what he is doing, but what you must do that your will shall be conformable to nature. For another will not damage you, unless you choose: but you will be damaged then when you shall think that you are damaged. In this way then you will discover your duty from the relation of a neighbor, from that of a citizen, from that of a general, if you are accustomed to contemplate the relations.”

In the book A Field Guide to a Happy Life, Massimo Pigliucci’s rewrites Epictetus in more modern language. Here is another example of a stoic response to abuse from family.

“But,” you say, “my mother has been bad to me.” Perhaps, but she is your mother nevertheless, and you should concern yourself with how you behave toward her, not how she behaves toward you. “But my brother has done me some harm.” What do you mean, “harm”? Has he forced you to change your considered opinions or the values you endorse? No, he can’t do that. Then there is no real harm. He may have behaved unjustly toward you, but that is his business. Your business is to behave toward him by considering who he is: your brother.

So, after years of therapy, I have broken off my relationship with my mother. It was a very difficult decision but the correct choice. Reading these stoic passages that I have posted really upsets me. Does Epictetus really expect someone to allow pain and suffering inflicted upon them just because you are related to them? Standing up for ourselves and choosing not to be harmed is within our own power, so I had thought I made the stoic decision to choose not to be harmed anymore. Perhaps this passage from Epictetus is a relic of ancient times in which you could never sever ties with family regardless of the situation.

Wondering about this quote.,"Hi everyone. This is my first post ever on Reddit and I hope I did respect the rules… 

I found this quote an hour ago on Stoic. And to be honest, I’m really new to Stoicism and I’m wondering how to interpret it. 

« Floods will rob us of one thing, fire of another. These are conditions of our existence which we cannot change. What we can do is adopt a noble spirit, such a spirit as befits a good man, so that we may bear up bravely under all that fortune sends us and bring our wills into tune with nature’s. » Seneca, Letters from a Stoic

To be more precise, I don’t understand what the first sentence have to deal with the rest. If some people can lighten my mind it would be great!",Stoicism,1704439480.0,t3_18z12id,0.57,1
Seneca on duties,"Seneca asserts, citing Democritus, that 'a relatively tranquil state of mind is only possible if we devote relatively little time to public or private affairs, or at least to those that are too great for our strength' in Book 3 Chapter 6 of 'On Anger'. He then goes on to suggest avoiding hunger, thirst, hard study or tasks

I was surprised by this. Having read the Meditations I had the impression that it was best to drive oneself strenuously into one's duties and enduring difficulties by accepting the present moment and modifying judgements. Seneca himself condemns laziness in his letters to Lucilius.

How is this to be reconciled? Is it about working within one's present limits, like someone starting out in exercise, who must begin lightly to avoid injuries that a dedicated trainer would manage with ease?",Stoicism,1704427040.0,t3_18yxc51,0.64,3

A Stoic's Code of Conduct and how to achieve Emotional Maturity and/or remedy Emotional Immaturity.,"I've been practicing Stoicism for a couple of years now, and I do see some improvements. So I am not a newbie and I know better that Stoicism is not about repressing emotions.

Like many of us, my upbringing was not perfect (and I have stopped blaming my parents long ago), and I had a lot of ""issues"".  I have come a long way, I do live a ""normal"" life, dare to say ""happy""; some people would even use the term ""successful"" to describe my life and me.

But I am still working on myself, constantly improving.

Recently I am working on my latent internal anger, and I have come to the realization that I am still, probably, Emotionally Immature.

I have got some good comments on this sub recently on related matters, and I am journaling multiple times a day, reflecting on things, and challenging my own *intrusive thoughts* and also my *Belief System* (aka BS).

I have read multiple times Massimo Pigliucci's *How to be a Stoic*, and William Irvine's *A Guide to the Good Life*; they are book good in giving practical examples of Stoic life.

I am looking to make a simple ""Stoic's Code of Conduct"", a list so to speak that I can review multiple times a day, and in case of emergency, and therefore I am asking 2 questions:

1. Do you have such a list or can you point me to one?
2. Can you please review my incomplete list below, and suggest additions/edits?

TIA

My Stoic Code of Conduct:

* Speak positively.
* Don't be sarcastic (I used to do it too much).
* Never complain.
* Judge a situation or a behavior, not the person.  What someone does is not the reflection of who they are.
* Never say anything negative about anyone (linked to the item above), even if it's true (this is regarding work).
* Pursue the Stoic virtues (of course), always.
* Apply the dichotomy of control, always.
* Don't give into consumerism, lean toward minimalism.
* Journal daily: at night reflecting on the day that just ended; in the morning planning my day.
* Be mindful every moment.
* Pay special attention when interacting with people, be mindful.
* When the mind goes into a spiral down a rabbit hole; just stop.
* You can do it. Whether you think you can or you can't either way you're right.
* No gossips.
* No drama ever.",Stoicism,1704420924.0,t3_18yv8qn,0.89,12
A Life Direction through Determinism and Stoicism,"Some background: (skip if too long)

I'm 16, and lately I've been really struggling to do anything because of not knowing where I'm headed. It all began a few months ago. I was honestly really doing quite well, to which I mean I started being more responsible, disciplined and was focused on self-improvement. I slept and woke up early, took my studies seriously, did daily chores, etc.

I also journaled to write down my thoughts, which mostly consisted of how to improve myself and live better. On one of these journal sessions, I realized that my actions is mostly just problem solving. So I looked into how to problem solve. I read some stuff, and came to the conclusion that it simply boils down to: knowing WHAT to do, HOW to do that, and WHY do that. You might know where this is headed, but yeah, the ""WHY"" part really had me thinking. Why am I doing all this shit again? Why do I eat, sleep, study, have fun, and all the kit-and-caboodle?

So, naturally, I looked for an answer. If the question is ""why am I doing anything?"", then what I'm looking for is reason (or maybe purpose or meaning? idk I'm unsure still). I read about existentialism, absurdism, stoicism, and a few others, only enough to kinda get the gist of it, and I also did some personal thinking. This was where my mind has been for the past few months, and this lack of reason or direction or whatever, has really had me demotivated and depressed.

However, I think I've reached some sort of answer that I'm content with and I'd like to hear your thoughts about it.

&#x200B;

It goes as follows:

Determinism states that all actions and events result from other actions, events, or situations. The way I personally like to word this out is: ""what is"" determines ""what is to be"". ""What is"" simply refers to the state of stuff right now, and ""what is to be"" refers to how the state of how the stuff right now will be.

""What is"" includes me. What am I? What is the state of the stuff that is me right now? Well I am human. And a part of being human, of course, includes survival. But, it also includes the longing for happiness. And I personally think that the stoic philosophy of building character, having virtue as the goal, answers this longing for happiness.

What I'm essentially saying is: Stuff exists, and how these stuff exist, or ""what is"", determines how these stuff will exist, or ""what is to be"". A part of ""what is"" is what I am, and I am a human that longs for happiness among other things. This determines ""what is to be"", which includes my decisions and actions. Hence, I look for what'll bring me happiness, which I believe is found through the stoic philosophy.

(just to add, I recognize that determinism is usually brought up when discussing free will and responsibility, but here, I focus more on the idea it presents about how our actions is explicable by what we are and what other stuff are.)",Stoicism,1704420821.0,t3_18yv7e9,0.5,0
Does anyone else feel stressed when trying to apply Stoic teachings?,"It's not the teachings themselves that stress me out but rather the fact that Stoicism as a whole is a life guide and basically offers an answer for almost all scenarios.

It's so stressful to always think about what's right and what's wrong and hesitating a lot to indulge in good food or watching anything fun because these things don't contribute to my overall potential.

I'm aware it's considered a waste of time (which Stoics commanded people not to do) but I can't spend my entire time doing the right thing, especially if it doesn't give a feeling of peace or comfort.",Stoicism,1704416975.0,t3_18yttiw,0.68,6

I have trouble understanding this passage in the passage before this one, he is talking about all the relations in the world and the Constitution of the human mind to receive impressions in and that this must be the work of a God. Then he ends the passage with the following

> ""let them explain what it is that bring all of this about, or how it is possible that such wonders that bear all the signs of workmanship come into being by chance and of their own accord""

I cant really put the passage \[12\] into relation to the End  I just quoted above. If you all would not mind to share your thoughts on this passage, and maybe if you think  it is meant to add to the passage from before.

How to confront lies as a wise stoic? ( using what is within control and outside your control),"My freind and i made plans to buy somethings for her party. We already agreed on the day we were to go. The day before i message her askking her what part of the day she wants to go and she does not reply me, or pick my calls even if know shes always on her phone. I then call a freind she lives with, the freind gives her the phone and my freind admits that shes already bought the stuff and shes been busy all day and didnt have time to reply or even call back. 

I know shes lying. In one of the messages i sent her, asking when she wants to go to buy her stuff, she diverts and asks a different question. It seems she was avoiding telling me, and im left wondering why. It seems she would have never admited shew has bought the stuff if i didnt gi the extra mile by calling her freind.  I am wondering why she didnt tell me shes already bought the stuff already. I know shes lying and i refuse to give benefit of doubt.

shes very arguementative and may not admit the lie. Confronting her may ruin the freindship, especially with her birthday coming up, it may be awkward if i attend.

Do i play dumb and not confront or calmly express that i feel she is lying? then slowly just avoid believeing her or trusting her in future.

However both do not offer much information on Stoic logic (aside from what I can deduce from the Stoic principles themselves although I can't claim to have understood those fully at all yet).

From what I understand Stoic logic was in some ways quite revolutionary and very distinct from some other ideas of the time (Aristotle being a prime example) and while no considerable body of work was preserved, what has been recorded is close to propositional logic which of course is very much in use in the modern age.

I need your opinion - Marcus Aurelius was a common man?,"So recently I stumbled upon this YouTube channel that barely has any views. In one of their videos, they were saying that Marcus Aurelius was just a common man and not a mighty emperor.

In the video, they said ""Marcus Aurelius was a common man who knew a lot of people, that is why he is still relevant to this day"" 

I´m not sure if it's a language barrier for me and I have maybe misunderstood what they are saying but I think it's important to note that Marcus Aurelius was a powerful emperor yet he never fully bathed in that power or used it in any negative way.

"Anger, results and confusion","Ever been lied to? It's annoying, isn't it.

I feel like I've been lied to about a lot of things in my life. Most of them along the lines of ""Just do this and you'll be fine"". Well I did ""this"" and I wasn't fine. These were often people who had duty of care over me and I had little choice but to believe them and ironically were also the people who taught me that not telling the truth was a bad thing.

So deep down, I'm angry. At them for giving me instructions that lead nowhere, at me for being too weak or naive to get the results or to follow the instructions well enough.

If it weren't for that anger I would never have learned to stand up for myself when under attack, it has protected me.

"Stoicism, The Prince, & The 48 Laws of Power","So I've been trying to be Stoic (I'm not that good at it yet), but I've recently experienced a large setback due to not being more instrumental/practical in my thinking.

I've been studying the 48 Laws of Power & The Prince. Are power, leadership, and the teachings of these works simply incompatible with Stoicism? Much of what they say make perfect, rational sense, but they don't seem to be in line with the actions of the philosophy.

Machiavelli says:
""Any man who tries to be good all the time is bound to come to ruin among the great number who are not good. Hence a prince who wants to keep his authority must learn how not to be good, and use that knowledge, or refrain from using it, as necessity requires.""

I made an inappropriate joke to someone and their reply was hurtful. How do I subvert my expectations of being apologized to?,"This is a fake scenario based off of a real problem I'm having.

I'm confused in how to feel and how to respond to they way someone reacted to a joke I made.

So let's say I, Jack, made a joke about vegans to my friend Mark, who is not a vegan but has told me previously that they don't like jokes at the expense of vegans.

After telling my joke, Mark said ""shut up, that's offensive"".

Now, upon reflection I realized that I made a mistake. There's no doubt in my mind that the initial mistake was mine. However I still feel hurt due to being told to shut up.

I have apologized for making the joke, and Mark hasn't apologized for his response. I feel like I expect him to apologize. Should I not?

This is something which isn't yet clear to me in the stoic teachings. I lack ""the wisdom to know the difference"". I know his apology is out of my control, but should (or could) I tell him that it was hurtful and that I would like if he doesn't do it again?

Is the first step to forgiving someone that you perceived wronged you to control your thoughts or your actions?,"There is someone who in the past hurt me. A family member. For a while I was angry but eventually I let go of the anger and decided to just stop interacting with her. I would be short and blunt with her and would not attend events that she would be at. The largest part of my anger was that she never apologized to me. 

I realize now that she did not injure me in anyway. The things she said that were true I had no right to be upset about and the things that were false equally were unimportant. 

I am able to now interact with her and be pleasant as if I harbour no negative emotions. I act with her as I think I would if nothing had happened. 

However when interacting with her I feel a negative emotion. Sometimes the remains of anger and sometimes some sort of sadness towards how I was treated. 

I feel as though these are not passions since I am not allowing them to affect the way I act but they do seem to affect my thoughts. It’s something I’ve been struggling with for months. I’m not sure how to approach it further. 

In my mind I rationally know that what happened was not something I could control but the way I think about it is however the emotions still occur whenever I see her.

Shaving your beard,"Please excuse the paraphrasing, I do not have my copy with me.

Epictetus says that if one is to practice philosophy, their conviction should be such that they are willing to lose their head if another demands they behave in a manner contrary to their philosophy. This is conveyed early on in the discourses in a metaphor about shaving one's beard.

He also says that one should not try to pursue causes that are out of one's control, because not only will one disgrace themselves in doing this, they will have abandoned a pursuit in which they could have performed well. This is from enchiridion 37.

A topical example is a hypothetical US citizen that believes that US aid to Israel is cruel. This citizen decides to not pay their taxes, in accordance with their philosophy. But then they are jailed, preventing them from the good they could have done while not jailed, and Israel still receives the aid because there are hundreds of millions of tax paying citizens. 

Quote 2 implies it is a better idea to just follow the law and pay the taxes. Quote 1 implies that we should not care for the consequences.

Am I misunderstanding? Is there a discourses chapter that elaborates on enchiridion 37?

Bushido and Stoicism,"I’ve seen here several people mention how stoicism has similarities to some eastern philosophies. Before I discovered stoicism for myself, I studied the samurai. I wanted to know why they were portrayed as calm people in media and culture. This is one of my favorite quotes and I believe it fits the stoic goal of calmness. Perhaps even fear of death. This comes from Inazo Nitobe (1862-1933). He was born into the samurai class, but was 6 when it was abolished. His book, “The Way of the Samurai” is one of two books that most influences samurai media. That and the Hagakure. 

“The Way of the Samurai” Chapter 4: Courage, the Spirit of Daring and Bearing

“The spiritual aspect of valor, is evidenced by composure - calm presence of mind. Tranquility is courage in repose. It is a statical manifestation of valor, as daring deeds are dynamical. A truly brave man is ever serene; he is never taken by surprise; nothing ruffles the equanimity of his spirit. In the heat of battle he remains cool; in the midst of catastrophes, he keeps level his mind. Earthquakes do not shake him, he laughs at storms. We admire him as truly great, who, in the menacing presence of danger, or death, retains his self possession; who, for instance, can compose a poem under impending peril, or hum a strain in the face of death. Such indulgence betraying no tremor in the writing, or in the voice, is taken as an infallible index of a large nature - what we call a capacious mind, which, far from being pressed or crowded, has always room for something more”

In order to be a good and just person should we correct lies we have told or bad actions we have done even if they will hurt the person?,"In an attempt to be a better person I am trying to right things I have done in the past and be an honest person in general. 

For example, in a joint business in the past I was under reporting revenue and over reporting expenses in order to pocket more of the profit. To right this wrong I have a cheque written for the difference to give to my partner. My question now arises in if I should tell him that I was stealing from him all this time. 

As I am someone he trusts immensely this would upset him and I am doing it to make myself feel better. 

I could alternatively lie and say ""I found some mistakes in the numbers, looks like you're owed this much more"". 

Is lying to make him feel better a stoic action?

I've analyzed this situation and I am not scared to tell him that I betrayed his trust. I am able to accept any fall out from it. I would obviously prefer to have him in my life as I consider him a friend but that is a decision I think he should make, not me. 

I feel as though I am starting to ramble now so I will stop shortly. 

I compared the situation to if I was told by a recent ex she was cheating on me the entire relationship. I would feel upset over that and think that it was unnecessary to tell me this additional information after we had broken up. 

The business is still running and I stopped playing with the numbers recently. 


This also made me wonder if we should go out of our way to correct any lies or misinformation we have given people or to just be honest going forward.

What things are determine what things do. Is this true? What does stoicism have say to this?,"Here's the gist:

* Doesn't know why he does what he does.
* Wonders ""what am I doing?"" and ""why am I doing it?
* What SHOULD I do and why SHOULD I do that?
* Wants a clear life direction.
* Tries to figure it out for months.
* Can't figure it out. Isn't satisfied with any answer. Finds despair instead.
* Has trouble doing anything cause of not knowing why he does what he does, or for that matter, why does ANYTHING at all do what they do?
* Reaches some sort of conclusion, which he still doesn't find satisfying so then asks reddit cause doesn't know where else.

The conclusion:

- Things just exists.
- These things exist in certain ways.
- The ways that these things exist can change.

This is reality.


What things are determine what things do, and what things do determine what things are to be.

ie. What a thing is and what surrounds that thing (the universe/ the earth/ society) determines what it does, and what it does determines what it becomes and what surrounds it becomes. 


If this is true, then:

What to do?
What you do is determined by what you are and what other things are.

Why do that?
What is done is done because of what you are and what other things are.

Contradictory quotes?,"Dear Posse.

Does ugliness rub off?  Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius seem to disagree, or can Marcus Aurelius’ words be interpreted into “ugliness will only rub off, if you let it”?

“Avoid fraternizing with non-philosophers [i.e., people who don’t try to improve themselves]. If you must, though, be careful not to sink to their level; because, you know, if a companion is dirty, his friends cannot help but get a little dirty too, no matter how clean they started out.”

Epictetus, Enchiridion 33.6

And 

“When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they can't tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural.

How to maintain relationship with parents while keeping my peace?,"Sorry, it might feel like a rant, but I don't know how to summarize what goes in my mind.

I ooz hate/anger in my head when I speak to my parents when they ask me to do things certain way. I usually listen for one or two times, and then in straight words, I tell them that I dont want to live that particular way  but if they want to, then it is their choice. My father  just switches the topic or hands over the phone to my mom. One time, when I recommended something then my mom said that she would listen from one ear and let it out from other. 

Part of me doesn't want to have any relationship with them, and the other part is like that they are growing old and live thousands of kilometers away.

2yrs ago, I stopped sharing my life with them over our daily calls unless it impacts them in some way. I really dont say much. I just listen to what they have to say about their life and leave it at it. This is out of respect what they have gone through to support me in whatever way, and I know they didnt have it easy.

However, I can't deny I question my choice to call them every single day because for them it doesn't matter as it's part of living life and I overthink. After all this, they try to associate with me, and I have noticed myself being instantly repellant to that association as I don't want to be like my parents.

"Many examples of stoicism in fiction on the sub, but how about the opposite?","Have you ever encountered a piece of media that made you question your stoic mindset?

\-*Darth Plagueis*, James Luceno

Yeah i know star wars is silly, but these quotes are the kind of thing that make me question some stoic principles.

Marcus Aurelius wrote to himself ""If it is endurable, then endure it. Stop complaining."" but isn't complaining a natural human response to stress? An stoic can even fool himself thinking that he can endure everything ""endurable"" only to snap like a brittle twig at some point.

Isn't having hope and goals two of the most powerful driving forces in humans? Yet stoicism says hope is the twin brother of fear. And even fear can keep living beings alive, same with anger and stubbornness.

Trouble with knowing which emotions are reasonable,"First: I mention some heavy thoughts, but I am in no active danger, so please don’t report this. I am in therapy, but I also want some logical input, because rationalising thoughts helps me. Thank you. 
 ———

To make it brief - I know that the right mindset can change *a lot*. That is what I struggle with the most, right after controlling my emotions (as in, not letting them control me). 


I am in therapy and have also started recently mood stabilisers, as my psych thinks the intensity of my emotions is not normal. But obviously I still need to work in therapy on actively calming myself and changing my mindset. I’m doing CBT which overlaps a lot with Stoicism. 


So:  I’ve struggled hard with guilt, shame, and as a result suicidal ideation for years. I often want to open up to my family about it, but I’ve been told even just breaking into tears over small disagreements is me being “manipulative”.  No words can convince my father otherwise, not even from my therapist. So just the idea of being vulnerable to my father (who has plenty reasons to be disappointed by and angry with me, as he is) and telling him “I don’t want to be alive anymore. And I feel guilty that I know I won’t ever attempt suicide because I believe it would be better for you. But I am too selfish even for that.” is terrifying. Not to be able to tell your own parent you wish to stop living, because you are used to negative responses to opening up, is so painful and invalidating. I don’t want pity from him, I want empathy and to feel loved. My suicidal ideation is real, and I need help. But it doesn’t go away from one therapy session, and I think beging honest about how you feel is important for well being. So not being able to be honest with my own father is… I am repeating myself. 


But is it “reasonable” or “okay” to feel sad that I can’t tell own father how I feel? Can I tell him anyway because it weighs so heavily on me, or should I keep it between myself and my therapist? Because isn’t the **reason** I’m sad that I care what he thinks? Is it “reasonable” in Stoicism that I want to trust and be loved by my parent, to want empathy from him? Or should I work on not caring what he thinks, because then, well, then I won’t let myself be controlled by my wish to get love from him? 


I am at a loss. To not care what my own father thinks of me seems so so cold and irresponsible. I am scared that if I don’t care what he thinks of me, I will might behave in ways that hurt him. 


But then, if he feels hurt, wouldn’t that be his responsibility and because of his mindset? 
But that sounds even colder. 


I don’t know what to think. I just want to be happy, and the man who said I need to ask for help more doesn’t understand that the best way for *him* to help me is to be empathetic.",Stoicism,1704150312.0,t3_18w9k4u,0.79,8
Overcoming Loneliness,"I'm curious if anyone has suggestions on overcoming loneliness.

Hello everyone. Needed some information and guidance from fellow stoicists. Would mean a lot to me.,"It's gonna be pretty unorganised so please bear with me.

My first point of concern is if I am doing something wrong or harming myself in any way by studying and applying stoicism?? That's my biggest concern right now. I am reading stoicism a lot and it has brought to me a lot of changes. I need to know if I am setting myself up for some bad outcome.

Here's some changes that I have observed after starting stoicism.

1. I have stopped getting post jut clarity. I know it sounds silly but it's a major concern for me. I used to have post nut clarity for when I used to feel low or needed to clear my mind. Now I can't. But I do get some resemblance of post nut clarity when I am reading stoicism. So I don't really know if that's a good thing or bad thing.


2. I have become way better in making friends. Earlier I used to have trouble getting respect from people now I am doing good not as much as I would like but far better than earlier. But I think I have lost my charming capabilities too. Earlier I could enjoy parties and be fun there too. Now I just dont see any point in parties. Everytime I see someone enjoying parties and getting out of control, I start judging them which is a wrong thing.


3. My other concern is that girls don't follow stoicism and it makes me prone to getting cheated on. Somehow I can't shake the feeling that getting complacent and indifferent leads to your partner getting a free hand and cheating on you.


4. I would really appreciate a mentor who has been actively practicing stoicism for a long time now.

People thinking I don't care,"Happy New Year all,

In practicing emotional control and not immediately reacting to a negative situation, has anyone else run into other people thinking you don't care?

Take for example, if a significant issue or mistake occured at work, I used to overreact to show coworkers and management how much I cared, but I eventually realized this caused me too much mental distress, and was not worth it in the grand scheme of life, it's just a job.

Since becoming a practicing stoic, I am getting the impression from others that my calm/indifferent reaction to situations makes them think I don't care, which is an issue concerning I am in management. 

Has anyone else run into this? My thought is my mental well being is more of a priority than what some boss might think of my level of engagement, and that an employer having an issue with your calmness probably isn't one to stay with.

The Praxis of Developing a Stoic Mindset - How can we actually start to think and behave Stoically? Here are my thoughts on concrete steps to take to begin moving towards the Stoic ideal.,"# Introduction

It's not secret that as this subreddit has grown, a large number of the topics are people seeking Stoic advice. A lot of these posts are however misguided in a way - they seem to be  looking for a particular kind of solution that you might find in an algebra problem. They want something that they can plug into the equation to solve for X, and thus find a neat and tidy answer to their problem - whether that's a broken heart, the effects of childhood trauma, or disappointment at their lack of self-perceived accomplishment in their lives. Stoicism is not a framework for solving for a particular value of X. It is rather a way of deconstructing the problem such that you realize looking for X is the wrong approach entirely. 

The suffering that people describe as stemming from various events (my romantic partner left me, I feel empty and defeated) is the categorical mistake that Stoicism seeks to address. It is a radical and revolutionary reframing of the human experience that begins with the detachment of human value judgment from the events and consequences that are happening every second of our lives. In simple terms, Stoicism would say that the breaking of your relationship is not the source of your suffering, but your impression of it is. If you broke off an abusive relationship and were now freed from violence and oppression, you would see the end of a relationship as liberation. It is your impression and interpretation of the event which creates the condition of pleasure/pain in your mind. And so Stoicism stretches that to almost every single thing that we experience, and demands that we detach from judging things to be good or bad so that we are not living our lives at the mercy of chance and fortune. Virtue is the sole good, and our virtue can never be affected by anything that happens to us, including physical pain, destitution or death. This is of course simplistic, but I wanted to set the stage with a broad overview before getting to the point of this post, which is:

# **How do I *actually* start thinking and acting Stoically?**

**The first step in developing a Stoic mindset is to develop the habit of having structured reflection about yourself and your life.** This means not only thinking about what you are doing and how you are living, but taking active steps such as journalling, and structured review of your thoughts/actions which you revisit later on. The process of putting thoughts into writing forces you to order them and clarify them. Pure mental thinking is ultra-high bandwidth with tons of noise and emotional baggage that cloud the ideas, whereas writing is a kind of structured thinking that forces you to crystallize your innumerable thoughts, and serves as a record for your future self. Its hard to remember what you were thinking about even a week ago, and it's imperative to have a handle on the evolution of your thinking and feeling. 

So if you are at a loss at where to start, start writing daily. Write about your life and your thoughts every single day. What is happening and what is your judgment of what is happening? What do you want? What do you feel is missing? Alongside this, pick a Stoic text and begin reading it. Don't worry about commentary, just read it for yourself first. Slowly, you will see themes from Stoic texts crop up in your life. Reflect on them - are they applicable? Do you agree with the author? Do you find the ideas persuasive or do you disagree with them? Explain yourself and your thinking. Later on, return to your writing and see if your mind is changing. You will be shocked at what you wrote 1 month ago, 6 months ago, etc. It will be a sign of your progress, and this is critical because Stoicism is a journey of self-mastery, and of self-responsibility. It is imperative you keep a written record. 

# **I'm already reading and journalling - what now?**

Our goal is of course to begin changing our minds, and that means achieving some kind of control over our reactions in real-time. In my view, the critical step is looking to carve a space between **action** and **reaction** in the course of our lives. At first, there is no space - we can only reflect on things hours or days afterwards. But as we continue the process of reflection and meditation, it finally happens - we get a brief flash of space between an event and our impression of it. An example from my own life might look like this:

> *Here is a typically angering situation for me. I can see it unfolding. This is a huge inconvenience to me. This person is completely disrespecting me and my time. I feel my blood pressure rising and my emotions lifting. I want to show my anger to this person, but I know I will regret it later. *

And I would still react angrily. I would say something disrespectful back, raise my voice, and lose control of myself. But still - I had time enough to have the above discourse in my mind. I could recognize it all happening, and I still couldn't control it, **but this is the first victory.** I could see the impression forming. And so then you reflect on the fact that you are starting to see the impression forming, you write about it in your journal. And then it happens again. And again. And you fail again. But then one time you catch yourself and actually manage to shift your reaction a tiny bit. You curb your anger. You take a few breaths and instil calmness into the situation. You are still angry but you're doing better this time. It takes less time for you to cool off after. And afterwards when you journal, you realize that this is the first time you've ever been able to stop yourself before fully engaging in the emotional reaction.

We see posts like these on here as well ""Stoic success stories"" - small but important anecdotes where people relay a situation where they caught themselves about to react badly, and asserted control. These victories stem from the earlier step of creating that tiny space.

As you continue to pile up these 'victories', you assert more and more control over your reactions. In your reflections, you begin to truly understand that when people are being rude or disrespectful to you, it is a reflection of their own hardships and ignorance, and nothing to do with you. You start to truly understand that getting angry is handing ownership of your mind to another, usually a complete stranger, who has already forgotten about you while you are still brewing with rage from your interaction with them. And so it becomes more and more natural to simply not react in these situations. 

# The key is to keep it in mind

The general theme here is that in order to begin to think Stoically, you need REMINDERS to do so. You need some kind of process that injects the Stoic principles back into the active thinking patterns and not just the passive ones that are occurring in times of acute pain. I think for most people, that has to begin with active, regular journalling and reading the Stoic texts. The more you think and write on them, the more they will be in your mind. And the more they are in your mind, the faster you will finally achieve that first 0.01 seconds of space between action and reaction, and then that space will continue to get bigger as you gain control over your emotions and cognition. As you gain control, you start to actually see the process almost from a third person perspective. This creates the conditions for further control, for more space, and the process continues and you can sink deeper into the true Stoic mindset.

As you go further, you are not simply getting better at calming down - you are starting to see the events for what they are, and they lose the ability to affect you in the first place. You actually begin to understand implicitly, not just logically, the foundational truth of the Stoic mindset. The logical understanding of Stoic ideas is not enough - 99.9% of you understand them already, but that doesn't magically change your mind. You need repetitions and practice so that your brain grasps it on an emotional level as well. Over time, you are seeing the problem differently - there is no X to solve.",Stoicism,1704132452.0,t3_18w2gxi,0.94,60

On discussing other people,"An excerpt from Simplicius’ commentary on *Enchiridion* 33 follows this chunk:

> But above all things take care not to talk of other People, neither so as to censure their Conduct, nor to be lavish in their Commendation, nor to make invidious Comparisons between one and another.

The commentary: 

> But above all things, he gives us warning not to entertain our selves, and our Company with talking of other People; neither so as to call their Behaviour to Account, nor to be profuse in their Praises, nor free in making Comparisons between one Man and another, as That this Lady is handsomer than That, or this Man Braver, or Honester than That, or the like. Now there is nothing more evident, than that this Topick does in a more than ordinary manner divert the Soul from its self, and its own Business; for it makes Men busie, and curious, and impertinent, extreamly inquisitive, and troublesome where they have nothing to do. But why should this (you'll say) do so more than any other? And what can our talking of other Men have in it worse than the Subjects mentioned before?

> To this we may reply, That the Person to whom the Advice is here directed, being one who hath made some progress in Philosophy, as not so likely to entertain himself with those trivial Matters, as with something that relates to Mankind, and their Affairs and Actions. So that it was convenient to draw him off from those things especially, which his own Inclina∣nations would most dispose him to; and there∣fore he adds that Emphatical Caution, But above all things.

> Besides, though it be true, That the same Affections are stirred in us by both Discourses a∣like, (for we are insensibly drawn in to love and hate things and Men by talking of them) yet there is one peculiar Vice attends our Conver∣sation, when we pretend to give Characters of other people; which is, That it strangely swells one with Vanity and Pride, and Contempt of others. For whoever he be that pretends to sit in Judgment upon other Mens Conduct, does it out of some imagined Excellence in himself, which he fansies gives him a Right to arraign his Neighbours. And besides, any mistake in our Judgments of Men, is more inexcusable, and of infinitely worse Consequenee than if we pro∣nounce wrong in those other trifling Matters; and therefore we should be very sparing and tender in this Point.

Holiday's Influence,"Just thought I'd mention this since I've been seeing some posts about ryan holiday. 

I've seen Stoics here mentioned that despite the twisted and misconstrued picture holiday paints about Stoicism, many people end up finding true Stoicism. Therefore, holiday may not be doing too much harm, but rather a benefit to people. 

I'd like to challenge that by telling my experience. 

I first heard of Stoicism in college, around 2016. I don't recall if it was on a podcast or a YouTube video or an article, but I came across holiday talking about the Meditations and Marcus Aurelius and Stoicism. 

And when I heard him, I easily saw he was just talking bullshit. And I completely disregarded Stoicism too. 

Fast forward, I graduated and got a job in finance in 2018. And one day while at a colleagues desk, I noticed he had the Meditations of Aurelius. This seemed to me to be a confirmation of what holiday was selling: Stoicism as some broski, hustle, self help bullshit that would be big with finance bros (like my colleague).

Of course I was wrong to associate Marcus Aurelius and Stoicism with holiday's bullshit. It wasn't until this year that I really got into Stoicism. And in all of those years, I didn't give Stoicism a chance because I (erroneously) associated Stoicism with bullshit self help. 

To be fair to me though, (and my point), holiday, in my experience, did not only not lead me to Stoicism, but also contributed to the impression that Stoicism was just a bunch of hustle culture self help bullshit. 

I could only speculate how better my life would have been had I given Stoicism a chance and read the Discourses. But that's futile. 

So just as holiday might help bring people to Stoicism, he might also help people push Stoicism away. And so, in this way, holiday might not be helping people. 

What's left for us is to simply guide people away from holiday and redirect them to Stoicism.",Stoicism,1704097173.0,t3_18vsd29,0.75,8

Reflecting on Ryan,"I was blown away when someone on this subreddit pointed out to me that Ryan Holiday's debasement of this philosophy has reached the point of him creating a site called ""[The Wealthy Stoic](https://www.thewealthystoic.com/)"" to openly shill Stoicism as a get-rich-quick scheme.

For years I have been telling people his approach is a poorly disguised get-rich-quick scheme. What he's done has taken all of the cleverness out of that observation - now anyone with eyes can make that observation, which makes me feel a lot less original (and that could be a good thing).

It doesn't anger me when I look at the ""Wealthy Stoic""; the feeling is more like bemusement. Stoicism is exactly the opposite of what he's selling - it's just remarkable that he's chosen such a staunchly ascetic philosophy as his basis for selling people their own greed back to them. Perhaps wrapping one thing up in the other somehow makes the grift more effective.

As the new year rolls in and I start moving towards my fifth year of Stoic practice, it's somewhat interesting to reflect on the fact that feeling as though Ryan Holiday was trying to scam me is what initially sent me to Epictetus, and learning from Epictetus is what unlocked the benefits of the philosophy for me. I had just started recovering from my drug addiction, and I was reading The Daily Stoic and another one of his books (possibly ""The Obstacle is the Way"" but I cannot quite recall). As I read I got the distinct sense that I was reading trite garbage attached to a sales funnel by a person who didn't *really* care for their subject matter, and who was disturbingly enamored with extremely wealthy people who had diddly-squick to do with Stoic philosophy. Feeling certain there must be more value to the philosophy than what I was being given, I googled something like ""who is the most respected Stoic"" and was directed to Epictetus. I purchased my Penguin Classics copy of the Discourses (Kindle edition of course - I wanted to start immediately) and I never looked back.

I can recall an overwhelming sense of joy and relief when I realized that not only was the philosophy far from the trite, vague nonsense Holiday was portraying it as, but I was reading one of the most profound forms of thought I'd ever seen written down - a distillation of all the wisdom I'd acquired in beating my addiction, plus a cognitive mountain of completely verifiable and entirely unique claims about the mind that I'd never have been able to come up with on my own, and which I now use every single day when reasoning about how to live my life. 

I live an honest life. I feel happy - I feel like I never lack courage and that I do not need to lie to anyone. I have a wife I love and I'm content with what I have - truly content, as in if I had my current circumstance for the rest of my life I'd die happy. Better yet, if every single object I owned were lost in some freak accident tomorrow, I'm fairly sure I'd be no less content - I might need a week to get my bearings, I'm far from a Stoic sage after all, but I doubt I'd need much more than that. 

It's strange to feel that way, and to have felt such a profound benefit from the practice of this philosophy, only to then see the person I once thought of as its titan looking haggard and exhausted, shilling get-rich-quick schemes on a scammy-looking website. It drives home a point the Stoics make themselves - that the wealth and power of the Emperor counts for nothing. To Ryan Holiday, Stoic philosophy is nothing but a way to grift - like any criminal, he makes his money robbing the unaware and scamming the credulous. To me, the philosophy taught me how to be happy. When I help people to understand Stoicism I don't do it for money, and I get to feel honest at the end of it, something I suspect Ryan Holiday hasn't felt about himself in a very long time.

"""Don't be overheard complaining... not even to yourself.”","This quote by Marcus Aurelius emphasizes the importance of not letting any attention flow towards expressing your discomfort with a situation. 

Due to this quote, I notice how often I complain about the most minor issues for the sake of conversation. I am surrounded by many people who complain about things in every other sentence, and it has conditioned me into believing that I must always find issue with something. Even things that in no way influence my life, I will complain because I am not comfortable with silence. 

Have you noticed this occurrence in your life? If so, have you dealt with it? How?",Stoicism,1704045581.0,t3_18vd7q2,0.97,143
Responsibilities,"I know that the idea of control is talked about to excess. What I can control what I can't control what I should try to control or other misunderstandings. I don't like the word control and I personally think it's a bad translation of the concept. 

Isn't it more productive to instead concentrate on what our responsibilities are? That's a much easier question to answer. What is your responsibility and what isn't your responsibility? Are you properly accepting responsibility for the things you say and do? 

Some things are our responsibility and some things aren't. Trying to accept responsibility for the actions and reactions of others does a disservice to them as maybe they're supposed to be learning a lesson. Trying to make someone else responsible for my actions and reactions does me a disservice because it removes my opportunities to learn and grow. 

For example if I had a child, to say I'm in control of the child would be not very correct. But I'm definitely responsible for the safety of the child as far as I'm able. I can't control the safety of anyone 100 percent.

Today I went from being right to being wrong. So much for my Stoicism practice.,"Today I was wronged. Someone did something.

I remedied, took matters into my own hands, and with effort and work, I remedied someone's malice or stupidity (Occam's razor).

Stoicism teaches us: 

* I did well. I used wisdom, courage, and justice.
* Now move on, continue to practice virtues, and - why not - do great things with your life.
* It's all done and over with.

But I had to confront that person, ask them why they did what they did. They lied and turned things around, accusing me of not telling the truth. So not only they wrong edme, but now they were trying to do the switcharoo on me? And falsely accusing me?

I tried to reason with them, nope, there was no way. I distanced myself and I reported to their company.  Then, later on, on my way out, I picked up the conversation again, which continued on the same note; till I lost my temper.

So, from being on the right side of the fact I become the villain. I was, the a-hole.

And this is where Stoicism is correct:

* What had happened (when the person wronged me) was outside my control.
* I was able to control some actions that I took to remedy.
* The entire event, now in the past, is 100% outside my control. There's nothing that I can do to undo what was done. Stoicism teaches me to do nothing, because there's nothing to be done. That is the wise thing to (not) do, that is the just thing do to, that would be a manifestation of moderation.

The actions that I took instead, the things I said, the letting my anger take over losing my cool were my doing, I did that, I allowed that, I went into the rabbit hole and continued to go down.

And now I can't sleep (ruminating) and I have been re-living those events for the past few hours. What a waste of life.

Now more than ever I see how the Stoic teaching are correct, always seek to be virtuos, by practicing wisdom, justice, courage, and moderation.

And by distinguishing what is within our control and what is not; and act accordingly.

And to be aware of impressions, since:

> We form our judgments and opinions based on what the Stoics called “impressions.” In broad terms, all stimuli (and our unthinking interpretations of them) are impressions.

Today was an opportunity for me to practice Stoicism at its best. If I had done that it would have been very low effort, just ""doing nothing"" really. I could have moved on with my life, doing something productive in the past few hours, and by now I would be sleeping like a baby.

My life is indeed the summation of the choices that I make, and Stoicism is a great co-pilot, if I choose to follow its advice. Everything that matters is 100% within my control. What is not doesn't really matter.",Stoicism,1704003082.0,t3_18v16fa,0.94,15

How to think when some people are facing hard times (& unfortunate incidents) while you are relatively well off?,"(post is convoluted and might not be comprehensble, I don't know how to express my feelings. )


two incidents made me this ask the question. seeing homeless person and another who is suffering from toxic relationship.

whenever I see homeless person, I feel terrible and physical unease. I usually see on shopping street or when I come out from eating at restaurant, which means I also feel guilty for spending money. (but you can't live without doing that) I don't spend on unnecessary things and don't eat at fancy places, I am still a college student and don't eat out often and most expensive meal I had on my own is $12 and that too twice or thrice a year.  But when I eat I usually see homeless person as I walk home from that place. I donate change I have but still I feel almost depressed. q's like Do I deserve the nice food I just had? why is that person suffering in cold outside but I go to nice, warm house? 


I am aware of very close person I know who suffered domestic abuse and had their life turned upside down, their religious family recognize the abuse but don't want them to divorce. 

after becoming aware of such things I become sad and it feels bad to do things I do and indulge in which are not necessary but essential to get on with my life. (like putting on nice fragrance when going to job interview, while hearing someone I know crying because of abusive relationship feels .... ) 

the essence of Stoicism dictomy of control. 
 these are the things i don't have control over, so focus on things I have control over. but feels odd to engage in some things while you see suffering.",Stoicism,1703964857.0,t3_18unmvd,0.63,2

Notes on Surmounting Daily Tensions,"A private note from myself to myself about having proportionate reactions to things and not causing myself unnecessary suffering. 
These thoughts have helped me over the past 3 years and might be helpful to others. I am not a writer and these rough notes I don't generally share. If this is nonsense or otherwise unwanted, tell me. I'll remove it and be gone.


This is not a test. This is the real thing.

When your 40 minute drive becomes two hours or your spouse uses more plates and forks than they need and it's your turn to do the dishes or a non-human animal under your care needs to shit some time around 4 am and you always prefer it be outside of the house so you wake up your brain, raise your body temperature a bit and go outside, sometimes you find yourself contorted.
All tied up in a knot for the duration of the bad thing. You're annoyed or angry. You wish to be in a different mental state.

Ask yourself:

Is this not life? In these moments when my (probably not deeply thought out) immediate preferences aren't met, can I not be satisfied? Can I only be satisfied if what I think I want is what I get? No. That seems like asking for trouble. Pre-meditated suffering. 
If I can learn to enjoy traffic then I'll always be satisfied.

My goal is to go from 
""oh, no. There is heavy traffic. My will and desires have been thwarted by circumstance. I will now lament what I cannot have"" 
to 
""I see that there is heavy traffic. I know that this is always possible. It only means that it will take more time to put my body where I want it to be. Good thing I am protected from the elements, robbers and great distances in my private metal box. It's not what I wanted, but these moments are also my life. I will not spend them lamenting or wanting anything other than what I get. At that point, it's too late to get otherwise. Accept the consequences at once so you can relax your breathing, straighten out your spine and focus on finding pleasure or contentness in the places you're not paying attention to. If you don't accept it, the consequences will still happen. You'll just be miserable and it'll be your own fault""",Stoicism,1703961546.0,t3_18umci1,0.81,9

How do I control my frustration towards others?,"Recently I’ve felt like I’ve been getting angry or frustrated over the smallest things, including statements from my parents. I’ve tried to calm my emotions, meditation and other techniques but I end up either yelling or getting unnecessarily angry at them due to miscommunication and not being on the same page. 

A recent example of this is my mum nagging me on getting a job (it has been a year since I’ve been unemployed) however during the start of the year she stopped me from getting/applying to new jobs due to my studies and exams. Now in these couple of weeks she’s  been complaining why I wasn’t working throughout the year, saying that, after being unemployed I “gave up” and was “too lazy”to find a job to her friends on the phone. In addition, she also complains/yells that the reason of no jobs accepting me was due to my appearance?!?! That it was because of my moustache and bleached blonde tips (note I am Asian, and she dislikes how I do not look like the stereotypical southeast Asian). Moreover, she sometimes doesn’t realise I’m trying my best, yes I agree I can be lazy and impractical, but they always disregard on what I Do and focus on what I Don’t (not sure if that made sense haha)Like I’ve been really trying my hardest to find a job. This lead me to lashing out and having an argument about it, and yet in the end nothing was understood between us on what we were trying to state, and she ended up pushing it off and blaming herself, that “it’s all her fault”. The same scenario has occurred with just different topics and statements ending in her blaming herself for being a bad mum.

This always made me feel bad, every time I’ve had an argument with my family members I always reflect on what I said and what I should’ve done instead of what I did with my actions, hoping that next time I’m met with this situation I can stop it from getting any worse. 

And I always remember that it is also their first times at living life and that they are also trying to figure their own lives out. With this I really do love my mum and I know she wants the best for me, I never want to see her sad or feel like a failure, she has gone through a lot of struggles and done so much for me, but sometimes our misunderstanding and miscommunication gets under my skin which leads to my outbursts of frustration towards them. 

But I hope that next time I’m able to calm myself in these scenarios so that we are able to communicate better, to be in the same page.

"""Isn't the foolishness of a few a more precious commodity than the wisdom of the masses?""-Fate Zero","Gilgamesh: I am fond of lives of hubris. People who harbor grand ambitions without realizing that they are unequal to the task. The mere sight of such people gives me great enjoyment. There are two kinds of arrogance. One where you are unequal to the task and one where your dreams are too big. The former is common place stupidity...but the later is a rare species that is difficult to find.

Kirei: But they are identical in that they are both fools, are they not?

Gilgamesh: Isn’t the foolishness of a few a more precious commodity than the wisdom of the masses?There are those who were born human but harbor wishes that man was not meant for...and have renounced their humanity in its pursuit. I never grow weary of watching their grief and despair. Kirei, what of you?(dialogue from fate zero)

When I read alittle about Gilgamesh, the story says he wished to become a God, one of the Gods. To which the gods agreed, giving him a series of trials which if he passed, he would become a God. One of them involved staying up without sleep for seven days and seven nights which he failed. So in that paragraph where he ""never grows weary of watching grief and despair"", he's engaging in abit of Schadenfreude against himself and all like him. The Stoic sage is an ideal, obtainable? I don't know, but would the stoic sage be considered a human or a God?, a God I think. So isn't it's pursuit a form of renouncing one's humanity on some level? Plato's philosopher king encourages himself  in  his Meditations to ""stick to what seems right""(the best goal to achieve, the one we fall short of when we fail), and to ""celebrate behaving like a human being, however imperfectly"". Well, I feel like we should have a Stoic Failure Story tag to encourage empathy, vulnerability and authenticity even further in this community.

 Arthur Koestler theorized that; when children are impersonating adults, a comedian is impersonating a public figure, men are disguised as women and women are disguised as men. The impersonater is perceived as himself and as somebody else at the same time. That while this situation lasts, ""the two matrices are bissociated in the spectators mind. And while his intellect is capable of swiftly oscillating from one matrix to the other and back, his emotions are incapable of following these acrobatic turns. They are spilled into the gutters of laughter as soup is spilled on a rocking ship. Here I am thinking about Chrysipuss, who Seneca believed ""saw the very bottom of truth"" dying of laughter. Koestler further adds that ""we are literally ""poisoned"" by our adrenal humours, reason has little power over irritability or anxiety. It takes time to talk a person out of a mood, however valid the argument;passion is blind to better judgment; anger and fear show physical after affects long after their causes have been removed. If we could change our moods as quickly as we jump from one thought to another, we would be acrobats of emotion"". And I'm not sure why but this brings to mind Arriana Huffington's quote, ""sleep is a feature of the human operating system, not a bug"". Which is why Gilgamesh probably failed to become a God. ""But what says Zeus? ""Epictetus, if it were possible, I would have
made both your little body and your little property free and not
exposed to hindrance. But now be not ignorant of this: this body is
not yours, but it is clay finely tempered. And since I was not able to
do for you what I have mentioned, I have given you a small portion
of us, this faculty of pursuing an object and avoiding it, and the
faculty of desire and aversion, and, in a word, the faculty of using
the appearances of things; and if you will take care of this faculty
and consider it your only possession, you will never be hindered,
never meet with impediments; you will not lament, you will not
blame, you will not flatter any person.""_Discourses 1.1. I heard Peter Theil once say that if someone could innovate a pill that would safely eliminate the need  for sleep, he would move the world from zero to one. In a way though, this person would be considered a fool, the same way we think of Socrates, Diogenes, Epictetus as having moved the world from zero to one for championing a philosophy that has stood the test of time.

Basic one I’m stuck on. How can I possibly be happy with horrible illnesses?,"I’m new here and have been reading “how to think like a Roman Emperor” as well as watching Einzelgänger on YouTube. 

For a bit I thought I was making mild progress. 

Perhaps I’m just tired, but today I was bombed by the thought that my chronic illnesses 100% prevent me from being happy, so I’m excluded from the benefits of Stoicism. I was stuck and couldn’t seem to find anything that I’ve read so far to help me out. 

However, I’m sure I’m missing something very basic here and I would love some help finding relief and getting back on track.

Making excuses and justifying for people that wrong me.,"Whenever people wrong me and treat me unfairly, I get angry at first but then I begin to find them a lot of excuses for their behavior and make up reasons for why they are the way they are. In the end, I give up on my rights or cause and resign myself to thinking that it is what it is.
However, this gives me sadness and a feeling of defeat.

What is the right mentality?,"Before my wrestling matches I often work myself into this state of anger and hatred toward my opponent and this has worked for me, yet I feel like I am not displaying my same ability I show when calm and cool in practice.

Looking for Good Translations of Seneca,"Hi! I have noticed some translations of original works are better than others.

Are we always in control of our thoughts and reactions?,"I'm completely new to Stoicism and currently reading ""The Little Book of Stoicism"" as my introduction to the philosophy.

I've come to the point in the book where freedom of choice is being covered in depth, specifically the idea that we're unable to control external factors in our lives however we always have control over how we perceive and react to these things, the section also mentions that only we have the power to ruin our lives.

I'm struggling with these concepts a bit.

I believe we can control how we react and behave to an extent but only within our given biological parameters paired with the environmental stressor. I think certain situations are harder for some, easier for others.

E.g. 

- There are people who have behavioural difficulties that descrease impulse control
- There are others with severe mental health issues which can cause executive dysfunction
- Addicts exist whose brains will crave a substance as though they would die without it (they may also suffer with one of the other bullet points to boot)

While a ""good"" choice can still be made, the ability is reduced when compared to neurotypicals with good mental health.

Despite the above, I've still found the ""You can always control how you react"" approach really helpful. My worst life decsions have been made when emotions are running high, there have been had countless past worries that I've tortured myself with causing unnecessary suffering.

I've tried to adopt a more mindful approach when my emotions are high and I've seen good results... however there's a limit. If lost everyone I cared about tomorrow, I would be unable to remain calm in the same way Viktor Frankl did or see this as something indifferent to my eudaimonian. (Things we cannot control being seen as ""perferred indifferents"" at best.) My happiness is partly tied in with those I love and I'm not sure I'd want that to change because it would feel like cutting myself off emotionally. I get that it's unhealthy to entirely rely on those around us for happiness, but for me to care is to be emotionally invested. I believe that to love is to accept the possibility of emotional pain.

I'd like to get thoughts from those more familiar with the philosophy though please.",Stoicism,1703894447.0,t3_18u1fx5,0.82,7
how can I stop worrying about these things that are out of my control," Title. I am an 18 year old guy, and for the past week, I have been experiencing fatigue, nausea, dizziness, and derealization. I was in a very bad rabbit hole a couple days ago, that I still am some-what still in, but have gotten ALOT better.

I kept googling, searching on reddit, trying to figure out what was wrong with me, and so I started to think I had: long covid (since i got it in july) , CFS, diabetes, kidney disease, bppv, dysautonomia, candida overgrowth (which ive now found out is fake), sibo induced symptoms (since i have gi issues for over a year now) , gastritis induced symptoms, you name it and i probably thought I had it.

I've found out alot about myself while going through this whole rabbit hole, and I've realized that im not really scared of ""death"" per say, I am more scared of not living my life because of a chronic illness not allowing me to live my life, and there for because I keep worrying about that, I don't really live my life.

My anxiety has gotten so bad, that now I can't really go to the gym without thinking I am having a heart attack or I keep focusing on the littlest things when working out. Like how much I yawn during my workouts. While I do think most of my symptoms are from my anxiety, I just can not help but think in the back of my head that there is some chronic condition that I have, that is also causing these symptoms. I just don't know what to do. I am trying to look for a therapist, and potentially get an evaluation done to see if maybe I'll need anti-anxiety meds?

My question basically is: how can I stop worrying about these things that are out of my control like dying, or developing a chronic illness that doesn't allow me to ever function or live my life again, and while all my friends are out partying or living life, I will be bed ridden and depressed.",Stoicism,1703889378.0,t3_18tzixa,0.83,8
How do I not be obsessed with my appearance?,"Ever since I was a child I have always been self conscious about how I look. Over the years I have gone on a dozen fad diets and am always on and off going to the gym. 

Here is the thing, when I am fit I get more attention, people give me the benefit of the doubt more, people trust me more, my friends want to be around me more, I have way more success in dating. Anyone who has been both ugly and attractive has lived through and knows this. There are also many research studies that prove that attractive people are perceived as more likable, receive higher salaries, and get far lower prison sentences. 

Now, I have read enough stoicism to know the stoics thought appearance to be an indifferent because it has nothing to do with one’s character.

Why do people think that being a stoic is being a heartless and apathetic person ?,"I swear outside of this subreddit (and even within here) most people don’t know what stoicism is really about, they watch those YouTube and TikTok videos where a bunch of coats and fake alpha males say things like “don’t show your emotions or ignore everything”

I’m reading meditations and phrases such as “as stoic is a good and kind person who servers the community” are things that (special as a dentist and healthcare professional) I took to my heart

Today I dealt with a toxic person in a stoic way,"Long story short 2023 was a really bad year for me, I was learning about stoicism but got away from the path at some point and let my negative emotions and anxiety dominate me 

I was super anxious about a college exam and so asked my friend if I could go to his house and say that I was worried, after that I got a bunch of messages from his jealous and egocentric girlfriend (who I used to call my friend) calling me a bitch that I was trying to have sex with him and saying that I was ugly and etc 

I tried to explain that I just wanted someone to talk with and even said that I was aroace but she ignored it

After that I noticed that I need stoicism back to my life and read meditations and took the idea of the 2.1 text “ I shall meet with the busybody, the ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial. All these things happen to them by reason of their ignorance of what is good and evil. But I who have seen the nature of the good that it is beautiful, and of the bad that it is ugly, and the nature of him who does wrong, that it is akin to me, not [only] of the same blood or seed, but that it participates in [the same] intelligence and [the same] portion of the divinity, I can neither be injured by any of them” 

And realised that that’s how she is, she’s aggressive and insecure and there’s nothing that I can change about it, today she tried to hurt me again and I simply ignored her, why bother with toxic people ?",Stoicism,1703875341.0,t3_18tu41m,0.93,73
Stoicism in the face of injustice,"I'm wondering, as I haven't been through all the literature yet, how do stoic deal with severe types of injustice.

For example: A mother fought very hard to safeguard her child from an abusive husband.
The child is safe now.
However, disease and misfortune strikes the mother and after a long struggle, she dies, leaving her child vulnerable again.
All the while, the abusive father runs rampant, never being held accountable for his deeds, experiencing the bare minimum of bad luck.
Worst case scenario, custody gets transfered to the father.

In a more severe case, this is the story of a sibling; or your mother.

How do stoics interpret these events; how do you deal with the sense of injustice in such situations?

Overcoming a major life mistake,"Would appreciate some guidance on how might a stoic best navigate a major life mistake?

I feel humiliated and defeated.  I know the past cannot be changed.  So all I can do is calmly set about dealing with the consequences in the present.

My mind, traditionally very determined and focused, is lacking the discipline to stay away from the humiliation mindset, the negative self talk, and the desire to keep going back to the past to fix things.  I allowed the initial situation to jar me so deeply that I fell in a vicious cycle.  That cycle drained everything out of me.  I speculate that’s why my previously strong mind seems almost unruly now.

How does one regain one’s head after losing it?  I don’t know if perhaps any of you has had any personal experience with this.

Diversity of thought in Stoicsm,"I would love to hear everyone’s take on a few related questions:

1. Diversity in early Stoicism: Do you think there was greater diversity of thought among the early Stoic philosophers compared to modern interpretations? 

2. Influence of surviving texts: Considering we learn about Stoicism through the few texts that have survived, to what extent do you believe our understanding is shaped, or perhaps limited, by this? Even among these sources aren’t there differences and contradictions?

3. Embracing diversity of opinion today: Given the potential variations in early Stoic thought, could we be more open to diverse interpretations of Stoicism in our community?",Stoicism,1703855247.0,t3_18tmqxv,0.75,2
Moving from fear of death to acceptance of it,"I’m looking for some stoic perspective on thoughts of death and negative visualization.

Recently, a few months ago, I had a surgery and ever since then my little mind is obsessed with the thought of the implant causing my death eventually. Thus, I notice I fear exercise, stopped hobbies, seeing friends, have no motivation for life. Some would call this a depressive episode, and suicidal thoughts were there for a few weeks but I overcame them after some time in therapy. As residue I feel like the fear is a  constant.

While I know that these are just thoughts, they seem to subconsciously define my living now. I keep analyzing my symptoms, the physical pain sensations, and mind feeds me images of me dying. And instead of accepting them, I fear them and am obsessed with them. I find it impossible to focus on anything else. Prior the surgery I found negative visualization a very powerful technique for relief and gratitude but now it only feeds the fears and suffering. Weird.

I have read a bunch of posts here on health, aging, and death, but I felt like reaching out nevertheless. Does someone wiser here have any perspective to offer me on this situation?",Stoicism,1703846640.0,t3_18tkdef,0.69,7
Is there any semblance of a Path offered in Stoicism?,"I was having a discussion with a friend of mine on the differences between Buddhism and Stoicism.

In many Buddhist traditions, there is a clear path to follow towards an enlightened state of mind. E.g., Lam Rim in Tibetan Buddhism. This path involves a defined set of practices to follow that are graduated according to different capabilities. Meditation is the core daily practice in the path.

By following a path, I mean following practices hat are different than simply acting as if one was in the end state already (acting in an enlightened way). For example, in Buddhism, there are practices of focusing on the breath or another meditation object; also practices of doing body scans of various parts of the body. This has little to do with enlightenment itself, but is more about training the mind in ways that are conducive for enlightenment.

In Stoicism, we hear of the most ideal ways to act in multiple life situations, but are there any paths or practices offered by the philosophers to work towards making those ideal ways to act come spontaneously (vs. just trying to act in a stoically correct way as much as possible from the beginning)? Resources appreciated.",Stoicism,1703840430.0,t3_18tit9x,0.67,2
Dreading the dawn of a new year and beyond it,"Some of you might be thinking, aren't t people supposed to be happy and feeling fresh for a new year. Well not so much for me. I'm a teenager. I got to put up with harder subjects, difficult teachers, in a new environment because of changing classes and having to put up with my family's reprimands or strict ideals. I know this might all sound minor.

But to top it off, I've experienced possibly the most gruelling period of my life I had ever faced. You might want to read my posts back in around April-July this year. Assuming that you've read my posts, I have developed a trauma towards the whole experience. I do not want to degrade others with much worse traumatic experiences. I'm afraid that next year I will have another ""gruelling period of my life"". Now the one back in April-July left me traumatised, so it makes the fear much more scarier. I'm not traumatized by the event itself, but the process of overcoming it. I went through a lot of struggle just to cope and overcome. And it was so arduous to go through that now I am intensely afraid of experiencing that same pain and struggle of overcoming another occurrence. Sometimes when I come across scenarios where the atmosphere feels similar to one of the situations back then, I would actually start to become self-conscious and panic. I would physically feel my heart starting to feel uncomfortable. Again, from an external view, this might seem a bit minor but for me it was definitely damaging so bear with me.

A part of me knows going through it is necessary for growth and learning. Since it was exactly that period of April-July that forced me to find something to help cope with things, that being finding Stoicism. Any similar hurdles in the future may also present the same kind of opportunities. 

But I can't help but worry and fear that similar things will occur in the next few years of my life. Just imagining having to go through so much of that same traumatic struggle. And this trauma causes the fear of suffering to overpower the fear of remaining static or the lack of growth. I also can't help but worry about the far future of my life as a whole and all the difficult things I need to deal with along the way. But I'll assume I won't live that long, and even telling myself this isn't enough (I am not suicidal by any means).

I'm aware that there are many stoic doctrines that can help with my situation or that this anxiety is just fleeting and should just live with it. But despite that I still can't help but worry. And I'm really starting to lose my ground to the present. It just keeps occupying my mind full of these scary images. And I don't have the time or privacy to randomly close my eyes and spend 5 or 10 minutes to mentally rehearse all my approaches(that's how I personally do it). Any advice from fellow stoic practitioners is much appreciated. It's also best if your response can be concentrated on all the aspects I've mentioned and thank you for understanding.🙏",Stoicism,1703836499.0,t3_18thtux,0.83,4
Wanting other peoples lives,"I’ve been trying to study Stoicism and focus on my own life and improving it, not in a selfish way but just making my life better. One thing I can’t get rid of is the comparison to every body in my life. It makes it hard for me to focus on doing the right thing and putting effort into my life because I just want what others have. I want to live and experience stuff they do. How do I stop wishing my life was different and focus more on where I’m at now so I can be a more virtuous person?",Stoicism,1703823685.0,t3_18te45f,0.67,4
"Recently started studying stoicism, what direction to go for better emotional control over things I cannot change?","A little background, most of my life I’ve been extremely stoic without even knowing what it was. Until I was 26, I would even say it was bordering on pathological and uncaring. I went in the military after high school and had never found anything emotionally difficult in my life, be that deaths of family or friends or anything else. I felt nothing, no honor, pride, or anything, even regarding my time in the military. Everyone would tell me how weird that is to not be proud and I never really understood that until now. 

At 26, my life took an extremely sudden turn. Following the break up with the only woman I had ever loved, suddenly, and if by magical intervention, I began experiencing emotion on a level I failed to control or understand. The first six months were absolutely horrible but since then I’ve been able to for the most part control it. But it has been an incredibly weird and interesting learning curve. Even though I broke up with her a year and a half ago, I am still vastly more emotional than I have been at any point in my life prior. Everything from movies to friendships to failure with women, etc., has caused some kind of emotional response whether it is something I can control or not. 

The last six months I’ve been back in the gym, picked up boxing, and studying/reading about a lot of topics. Just generally continuing my self improvement. Once again I have found myself upset at something I can no longer control. I finally set up a date to ask a woman out who I have known for over a year, just for that very same day to be the day she told me she is finally in a relationship again. There’s nothing I can do now, I missed my chance and anything other than supporting her would be wrong. 

This has prompted me to look into and begin studying stoicism. I dusted off a book a friend gave me several months ago called How to Be a Stoic: Using Ancient Philosophy to Live a Modern Life. I have been reading and taking notes. So far I have been extremely pleased with this ideology. I honestly think this is my solution and my framework for learning how to channel my old stoic behavior towards things of which I have no control while maintaining this newfound emotion for things in my control.

I’d greatly appreciate any help pointing me in the right direction regarding authors, books to read next, or any stoic philosophers that come to mind in my situation. I am very excited and hopeful that stoicism will help me reach what I am beginning to expect it can. Stoicism just seems like the perfect framework for balancing out my life. 

TLDR- For most of my life I was very stoic until a break up caused me to become quite emotional. After studying stoicism the little I have, I believe it can help me channel my stoic nature towards things changeable and my newfound emotion towards things I can change.",Stoicism,1703817065.0,t3_18tbvhg,0.79,15
"Running away from ""change"" but how to stop that in 2024 ?","

I'm not sure what the right phrase is like comfort zone, change, responsibilities, take life serious, take actions. I feel like I've been avoiding working on my life for almost 2 years now and now that 2024 is about to come in few days. The feeling of regret and shame is boiling down internally. I'm reflecting so much right to a point Im feeling overwhelmed and emotionally mentally exhausted. I realize my mistake and I don't blame nobody but me.

"What is the difference between ""Thoughts to yourself"" and ""Meditations"", by Marcus Aurelius?",Some people say Thoughts to yourself is a part of Meditations and some people say it's a different book. What's the truth?,Stoicism,1703788689.0,t3_18t12gd,0.85,5
Following my passion or following what my parents think is best for me.,"I (M,23, working class) hardly go out, I study at college (it's free here) and live in a developing country. I have friendships that are not really friendships since I hardly interact with them and I don’t have much in common, in reality I just have two true friends which I see seldom. My mother (F,41) says that I need to get out of my shell, wake up, go out more and I just realized that what I really like is art, which is a great coincidence; however, I am very clear that I want to dedicate myself to art and design, after drawing since childhood and coming up with stories, ideas and new narratives since childhood also and being part of an NGO and doing great things for the Marketing Department. I also decided I could look for groups with interests similar to mine. My mother, however, tells me that I have to look for other environments besides the one I want, to see how the real world is, and that I have to open up to other environments and that she can accommodate me in a job with my father where I can learn how to relate to other people, but that is not what I want at all, because I feel that I would be betraying myself and my ideals if I take that job. She is also looking for opportunities for me within her job, and says that I have to open up or else, I will be lost for many years like my father (M,41), who has been in the limbo of jobs he didn't like until he found a stable job (although, my father always wanted to be a full-time musician but wanted to find other jobs out of necessity cause he had a child, me, even though there were lots of opportunities as a musician). I have also worked for a Google Partner agency for some months but they fired me cause I couldn't meet the KPIs, and honestly, I didn't like that job and also had school and my volunteering at the NGO. That is my problem, choosing between dedicating myself to what I like fully or doing other things and leaving art and design as a hobby. As additional information, I have gone through diagnosed Generalized Anxiety which was crippling at the beginning but that over time it has lost power, and really in social environments I have trouble staying focused and I tend to be extroverted in some situations but according to my mother I do things that are not relevant or that are not socially acceptable (basically I lack social skills and everyone can step on me, as she says), such as asking an Uber driver politely if he can change the music being someone I just met today, or asking them (my parents) what they are talking about when I get to the table with them, that according to her. She also told me that I have to adapt to this society that is very superficial, in this developing Latin American country, since she lived it that way. Basically image sells way better than intelligence and competence, and she is saying about my attire and that I need to dress better, to which I agree. What can I do about it? What would be your advice? I understand that she wants the best for me and cares for me considering the situation in which we live in, but I just took a path I realized I didn't want once with my first degree, and lived in fear and pending for other people's approval for way too long (to which my mother disapproves because she says that if that was the case, I would be working on myself already).

Looking for the source of a quote by Marcus Aurelius,"I'm looking for the source of a quote about criticism. I believe its from Marcus Aurelius but I can't find it. I googled and found a reference to it here:

[https://dailystoic.com/how-to-not-be-afraid-of-criticism/#:\~:text=As%20Marcus%20Aurelius%20writes%2C%20if,and%20already%20be%20fixing%20it](https://dailystoic.com/how-to-not-be-afraid-of-criticism/#:~:text=As%20Marcus%20Aurelius%20writes%2C%20if,and%20already%20be%20fixing%20it)

>""As Marcus Aurelius writes, if that criticism is correct and we are in error then the person criticizing us has done us a favor by correcting it. If they are wrong, what do we care? More likely, if we are doing our job right, we should already be well aware of the issue that people are raising and already be fixing it.""

EDIT: Please... this is about the correct source of the quote and not about Ryan Holiday. IMHO quotes without specifying the source of the quotes are almost worthless because then you can't check the context of the quote.

But so far I was unable to locate this in the Meditations. I did find Meditations 5.3 which is similar but not the same:

>\[3\] Judge yourself entitled to say or do anything that’s in accord with nature, and don’t let yourself be talked out of it by any criticism or argument that may follow as a consequence. If it was the right thing to do or say, don’t put yourself down. Other people have their own command centers and their own impulses, and you shouldn’t let your attention be caught by them, but carry straight on,6 following your own nature and universal nature, two things that share a single path.

Epictetus Encheiridion 42 is similar:

>42. When someone acts badly towards you, or speaks badly of you, remember that he is acting or speaking in that way because he regards that as being the proper thing for him to do. Now, it isn’t possible for him to act in accordance with what seems right to you, but only with what seems right to him. So if he judges wrongly, he is the one who suffers the harm, since he is the one who has been deceived. For if anyone should think a true composite judgement\* to be false, the judgement itself isn’t harmed, but the person who has been deceived. If you start out, then, from this way of thinking, you’ll be gentle with someone who abuses you, for in each case you’ll say, ‘That is how it seemed to him.’

Can somebody please give me the source of the Marcus Aurelius quote (Meditations book/chapter) ? I don't want to use this like 'Somewhere in the internet I found that Ryan Holiday said that Marcus Aurelius said that,,,""

Thank you in advance.

Oh, BTW, if I'm incorrect and its not from Marcus Aurelius then I made a mistake and feel free to correct me, I will not be harmed :D",Stoicism,1703761895.0,t3_18srj8d,0.8,3
"Breaking the cycle, how?","Hey fellow stoics, I have some questions that I like to gain some insight in. Also, sorry for using a throwaway.

Some background about me. I have what I would consider a successful and fulfilled life. On the other hand I have always dealt with some mild level of anxiety, depression, perfectionism and self doubt. Not exactly to the point where I consider this clinically relevant but it's still annoying and probably the root cause of some of the issues I dealt with for years (if this is relevant I can go into details at a later point).
I have some formal (university level) training in philosophy and stumbled on stoicism a couple of years ago. I read Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and a couple of others.

So here is the issue: on a rational level all of stoicism makes perfect sense to me. I can subscribe to almost all if not all of the points, BUT... I feel like I struggle big time applying them to everyday life. How much varies by occasion but in general I blame this to my latent anxiety issues. I want to give two examples:

I have a rather annoying and difficult neighbour. This person is for some reasons, which I can partly empathize with (although I'm legally and morally in the right), angry at me and tries to make my life harder. To this date almost all of the stuff are minor incursions, making noise, minor insults, throwing rubbish over the fence in my garden now and then. Rationally I know perfectly well that I should ignore him, that I should just continue to live my life. This situation continues for half a year now and the agressions Come in waves. Whenever there is a new set I'm losing my composure and start spiraling into a fear hate anxiety thought spiral which wrecks my whole day. When I try to rationalise this there are still the physiological symptoms, heart beating, muscle tension etc. This immediately pulls me back.

Second example are certain interactions with my son. There are certain instances where his behaviour is triggering my rage and this is 100% out of that I love him and see that a certain behaviour in his future will probably hurt him and so I have to somehow deal with this. Whenever I throw a fit I immediately regret it because I realise how irrational this is. Also there mostly the physiological reactions suck me completely in and my rational brain shuts off.

Those are but two examples where I have a huge cognitive dissonance between how I know I should act correctly and how I actually react.

About things you cannot control,"I am new to this. What i understand is stoicism focuses on things you have control on, how to control things you can control. By default, humans are bad about distinguishing what they are in control of, and what they are not, and they are bad about actually controlling things they can control.

However, does stoicism promise to completely let go of things you cannot control, no matter how grim, exhausting and horrible they are? In the sub i noticed a frequent answer of ""Do you have control on it? If not, just go and focus on things you have control on"".

 To me its not realistic, to just not care and not be bothered by things you dont have control on. Similiar to be a buddist monk, to let go of earthly desires etc. Those who actually achieve that are born in temple culture and has no metropolian city problems in the first place. 

Maybe you can be bothered less, maybe you realize they are not that important to be bothered so much and let go, but can a hypotetical person John, who is cancer, is 4'5'' height adult male and in a third world country with a very toxic family, with no way out of his house, achieve to be not bothered by all this?

Thinking less extreme, i see its completely normal to be bothered by being unattractive for example. It is objectively hurting your social status especially dating. Maybe you are not absolutely doomed, but to simply say ""just focus on things you have control on"" sounds a shitty advice to be honest. ",Stoicism,1703760742.0,t3_18sr89r,0.62,3
How to best practice stoic values?,"In particular I’m having trouble letting go of that which I cannot control.

I had what I deemed the perfect life about a year ago.  I’d worked decades for it.  A turn of futures changed that early this year.

I’ve been doing therapy and reading a ton to try to overcome the trauma the change caused.  Yet it remains quite challenging for me to simply practice radical acceptance and be “happy” again with significantly less.

To elaborate, a year ago I was about to marry the love of my life with whom I was looking forward to starting a family shortly thereafter.  I’m 36 now.  We broke up in January over a personal tragedy of mine.  Now not only do I still have that personal tragedy to live with the rest of my life; I lost the woman I wanted to build a life with.  The personal tragedy left me with fewer prospects at a time in my life when I had already started feeling the pressure to start a family.

Struggling to radically accept my tragedy and my diminished prospects.  Even if rationally I can see that I have no control over the past and only reaction to it, I still struggle to no get down a year into it.

December’s Trials,"The month of December’s been a real test. In order of sequence.

* Mass Layoffs in my organization. I was forced to lay off 12 people on my team. About 70%.
* My cat of 12 years was diagnosed with lymphatic cancer. He died two weeks later in my arms when we euthanized him while he was starting to have congestive heart failure.
* We got a call my wife’s father was going to pass. Got on a 5 hour flight to a different country the next morning. He died 3 days later when we were in the room. Difficult scenario. Multiple religions. Multiple cultures. His burial wishes were odds with the family. I had to mediate between passionate people.
* Got a respiratory illness on the plane there, kicked into full gear by the time I flew back.
* Multiple hour plane delays.
* By Christmas Eve I got gastritis. Recovering now.

I had Stoicism by my side throughout. Quick reminders to calibrate me at the thousand moments throughout it all.

When my cat passed, I remember feeling grateful to have premeditated on this event for many years, never having lost an opportunity to enjoy him. Taking comfort in knowing I did my best to save him. And helped his passing when nothing else could. I’ll miss that little guy. But he’s been restored now.

When I was mediating a difficult family situation I anchored everything around what my proper role was in this family as a husband of a wife. A son-in-law. A guest.

When I got sick I recall being grateful for an opportunity to be reminded how nice it was to be absent of symptoms. There was one day I had a 7 hour migraine, pain piercing through all thoughts except a thought that I desired for things to be exactly as they were.

There were a thousand moments for Stoicism. A thousand reflections. It saved me from so many passions. But I won’t lie to you and pretend I was free from them.

When my cat passed, I was angry at the universe for about a day. In temporary disbelief, even though I witnessed his passing with my own eyes. I was inconsolable.

Now that I’m through it all. I have to admit I am exhausted. I would even go as far as saying I feel depressed. Like missing joi de vivre. Like the world lost some saturation in its colour. I cannot diagnose the cause for this, so I am giving it some time.

We go through these things because we have to. The only choice we have is in how we choose to take it on.

I recall Zeno’s story of the dog and the cart. I recall Marcus talking about what bearable pain is. I recall Epictetus and his many lessons about loss and one’s proper role. And envisioning how you’d like to maintain your character in adversity. I recall many of the people of this community, their insights and advice to others.

Struggling to balance the teachings of stoicism with other conflicting philosophies,"I (19M) recently got into stoicism this last summer, as the teachings of self control and freeing oneself of anxiety deeply resonated with me. Marcus’ Meditations was actually the first book I’ve completed out of my own interest, rather than being forced to read by a school curriculum. I began to implement many of the stoic teachings into my life and found mostly positive results.

However, recently I’ve started to get into conflicting philosophies, such as Machiavellianism and I have picked up books like Robert Greene’s 48 Laws of Power to supplement this interest. Through reading works like the 48 Laws of power, I came to a realization that it is nearly impossible to balance these 2 differing ideologies at once. Both these ways of thinking resonate with me in different ways, both being equally compelling.

Against Nature as Grounds for Compassion,"*  Musonius Rufus, like the other Stoics, advocated love for our fellow man. So then, what justification does Rufus give for compassion? He argues that compassion is in accordance with human nature. He justifies this by pointing to what we can observe in both human beings and bees, with both species cooperating with their own.
* My problem with this is that all kinds of things we would consider evil, such as rape and murder, are also part of human nature. Does that mean we must do those things too?
* Rufus would, I believe based on certain passages, counter this by saying things like rape and murder are hated and punished in all societies, at least within the boundaries of said societies (native American tribes would have no qualms about hurting members of other groups).
* The problem would be that this is a justification based on social consensus. It would be essentially saying ""Society approves it, therefore it is right"". And yet, there are things that societies past and present have approved of that are obviously immoral. Child sacrifice, female genital mutilation and ritual animal torture are things that have been or still are practiced and approved of under social consensus, and the reader of this message would most likely reject them with vehemence.
* Therefore we must conclude that nature, whether it be the nature of individual humans or the nature of society, is no grounds for compassion. ",Stoicism,1703699673.0,t3_18s6mnh,0.67,1

Emotional Repression w/Misapplication of Stoicism,"
u/SimonDK1994 brought up a very good point to my previous post: 

1.	⁠Make **S**ure to acknowledge your feel**i** n **g**s. People trying to practice stoicis**m** tend to surpress feelings before they learn th**a**t they should actually acknowledge them more and THEN deal with them rationally. This can lead to pinned up emotions and at some point send their world crashing down.(Ask me how i know)

I have been reflecting on it a lot more, and realize that I’ve actually been repre**s**sing my emotions *a lot* more than I thought. So I did more studying, and I’ve concluded the following: 

If there is a situation that ruffles me up, such as the train being delayed, I feel inpatient and angry. Because I’m trying to practice Stoicism, I usually would remind myself “Be calm, there’s nothing to be angry about.” This never actually wor**k**ed as **i** would *pretend* that I’m calm and **b** el **i**eve I was succee**di**ng, but inside I was reaching my boiling point. The issue here is that emotions are dependent variables, so we cannot simply say “Don’t be angry, there’s nothing to be angry about” as the anger has already been produced. If I want to not be angry, the anger has to genuinely not come in the first place. If it does, that is when we should reason to attempt calm ourselves down, not to pretend that we can just will our emotions away. Wait, is that what Epictetus meant when he said, 

“*For this reason also it is ridiculous to say, “Suggest something to me.” What should I suggest to you? “Well, form my mind so as to accommodate itself to any event.” Why that is just the same as if a man who is ignorant of letters should say, “Tell me what to write when any name is proposed to me.” For if I should tell him how to write Dion, and then another should come and propose to him not the name of Dion but that of Theon, what will be done? What will he write? But if you have practiced writing, you are also prepared to write anything that is required. If you are not, what can I now suggest? For if circumstances require something else, what will you say, or what will you do? Remember then this general precept and you will need no suggestion. But if you gape after externals, you must of necessity ramble up and down in obedience to the will of your master. And who is the master? He who has the power over the things which you seek to gain or try to avoid.*” - Discourse 2.2 “Of Tranquility from Pertubation”

We were being sold a product, and made to feel we were not good enough for a specific institution. The stoic perspective says not to hold onto external opinions and that's correct. Yet I keep feeling this was an educated opinion. And why should I hold onto this?

Best book / text that talks about indifference,"Hi there, 

I have very little exposure to Stoicism, knowing only the basics. I have pretty sever OCD and intrusive thoughts and I have tried to deal with them through meds and talking therapy. I feel like I know the origins of my thoughts and the core beliefs from which they stem. I can also manage to gain some composure and control over my compulsions. 

However, I am trying to get to the place of indifference to my thoughts/fears. I have been single for 10 years because every time I start to date and get close with someone the fears of loss and abandonment start, and then its often been a fulfilling prophecy. I would like to become indifferent to this, 

Are there any specific books/stoic philosophers that might be helpful for me to read, to learn how to get into this practice? I am aware that suppression is not going to help  and that we can confuse suppression with indifference if we are not careful!

How would you proceed in my situation from a stoic point of view? Advice for dealing with a flaky friend,"A friend I considered close has disappointed me and out of curiosity I would like to hear how others may choose to act in this situation (from a stoic point of view).

A month ago I had a low point and messaged my friend if she could call me whenever she was free. No response.

A month passes and she completely ignores the message. I know she'd been out partying etc. At the very least she could've messaged me just to let me know she's a little busy and will catch up when she's available etc. out of respect. 

Additionally, I usually spend Christmas with her family because I'm in a foreign country and I've gotten close with them; they are always so caring and kind to me. Before this silent month, she had mentioned the invite from her parents again. But since ignoring my message she also never followed up on that invite or bothered checking on my Christmas plans etc. I also did not feel comfortable reaching out to inquire about coming over for Christmas since she hasn't even had the courtesy to open my message. 

Finally I receive a lame message from her on the 23rd about how she apparently didn't notice my message and that she's been busy working and fell ill on the week etc. 

I love her but I know she has tendencies to be...entitled and kind of unreliable. Not only with me but that's her core personality. She does what feels best to herself in the moment dealing with the consequences later. There's also been one other ongoing issue (nothing too serious but still enough for me to get annoyed and insecure) that I've tried to communicate to her but her behavior has not changed and I'm not sure I'm comfortable tolerating it anymore. 

I haven't bothered to respond to her message yet. I considered just ghosting her myself snd not talking to her again. Is that a bit too strong a reaction?",Stoicism,1703551315.0,t3_18qvdts,0.67,3

"""The beginning of philosophy ... is an awareness of one’s own weakness and incapacity when it comes to the most important things."" -- Epictetus","Kind of going back to basics on this one (from Discourses 2.11).

Once I started accepting my own flawed nature as a typical human being, I could look back upon my earlier failures with more compassion and forgiveness.  With this came welcome sense of peace and relief.

How would a stoic react to bullying?,"

Just graduated from high school, but the entirety of my last semester was spent being gaslit and bullied by one of the school’s favorite students. They promoted her as the most perfect person in the school so I felt like there was an ideal I could never measure up to as a boy, meanwhile she constantly mocked and belittled all of the boys in our class including me, but when I tried to tell the teachers about it she targeted me specifically.  She gaslit me into thinking I was some kind of monster she couldn’t feel safe around and I was scared to go into school most of the time. When I tried to talk to her about it, still thinking she was a good person, she got the teachers to shut me down entirely. Now I was not only being manipulated and bullied, but I couldn’t defend myself. Meanwhile the school, a Christian school btw, promoted her as the most perfect and Christ like student. She was one of their best athletes as well. The teachers refused to do anything about her and I ended up in some pretty disturbing patterns including potential suicide. I eventually came to find out that she was bullying everyone else too, but it was all completely permissible by the school. I don’t know what to make of my faith as a whole if that is what Christianity looks like.

Practice of stoicism or complacency?,"Lately, I have tried to speak up more in situation I don't like.

I am honestly torn between these 2 ideas:
1) The Original Way: Accept that everyone out there is playing a role in my growth and the burdens I am given are just tests that I must accept and deal with them.
2) The Other Way: Speak up, try to change the situation if given, but if it doesn't, then accept it.

I am a big fan of balance, and I think the 2nd approach helps to achieve that. Since I lean towards being complacent, I should try to be more vocal.

"Question for veterans and seasoned stoics. Stoicism had its boom, but what details of this philosophy were left behind?","Like many, I became familiar with Stoicism because at some point it became mainstream. The basics are there, but I'd like to ask the veterans of this philosophy a few things. What part of Stoicism is ignored in its most commercial version? Is there any aspect of Stoicism that has been given more importance than it should? Is there any concept that has been distorted?

For example, I understand that Stoicism also dealt with metaphysical issues. This is not something that is mentioned frequently. Is it not talked about because it is not so important for this philosophy or because it has been preferred to ignore it so that Stoicism can adapt more and better to our society?

More vile and craven than the irrational animals,"I've been unemployed for disability-related reasons for quite some time. As I work my way through discourses I get to the part where self-sufficency is talked about, specifically this part: 

>And shall it be necessary for our philosopher, forsooth, when he goes  abroad, to depend upon others for his assurance and his refreshment,  instead of taking care of himself, and to be more vile and craven than  the irrational animals, every one of which is sufficient to himself, and  lacks neither its own proper food nor that way of life which is appropriate to it and in harmony with nature?

My parents said the realisation came recently but you took the best decision at that point of time and its not really regretting over.

Applying principles in day to day life,"Hello, folks.

I have read about Stoicism for some time now, and am slowly but surely making my way through a number of books. My initial introduction was quite by accident when I encountered Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. This has also led me to read Letters from a Stoic - Seneca (I am not finished), and some of Epictetus (Discourse and selected writings. Translation,etc...by Robert Dobbin)

So much of this seems to make sense to me and I think there is real value in this philosophy. However, being so new to this, I am having difficulty in translating philosophy to concrete actions that I can take.  Amongst the most simplistic, but incredibly difficult for me to do is changing my mindset. For example, Epictetus states, “Man is disturbed not by things, but by the views he takes of them.”,and Marcus Aurelius states writes, ""Do not waste time on what you cannot control.”

What are concrete steps one can take in this direction? 

I have read the [Advice and Coping With Problems Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/wiki/advice/#wiki_advice_and_coping_with_problems), and again this makes sense when Epictetus wrote in Discourses that this takes time. (In answer to a man wanting a fig.) ""Let the tree blossom first, then put forth its fruit, and finally let the fruit ripen. Now although the fruit of even a fig-tree is not brought to perfection all at once and in a single hour, would you still seek to secure the fruit of a man's mind in so short a while and so easily?""

How does one even plant the seed of fig tree to begin with? 

* Are there concrete steps that one can take to plant the seed? 
* Once this seed is planted, are there concrete steps that one can take to build the mindset to manage how one views things?

Thank you for your advice and allowing me a moment of your valuable time!

Senecas view on frequent travel,"Hi everyone! I just started reading ""Letters from a Stoic"" by Seneca. In Letter II of the book, Seneca states the following:  
""To be everywhere is to be nowhere. People who spend their whole life travelling abroad end up having plenty of places where they can find hospitality but not real friendships"".

I wanted to pose an argument to this statement. I am hoping to have others chime in with their own view / a response that may have been expected from a person like Seneca:  


Is it necessary to be somewhere? I argue that the brief and admittedly capricious interactions with other travellers and locals often exceeds the knowledge and wisdom that is to be gained at home. If I prioritised a friendship at home at the expense of gaining new cultural perspectives or wisdom from people I meet abroad, would I not be prioritising a passion over wisdom? Could the desire to form friendships not be interpreted as exactly that, a passion? Wisdom is a virtue part of the true good. Would it not by necessity be more valuable to seek out wisdom that is not otherwise to be gained at home, at the expense of lasting friendships? Sure, wisdom and new cultural experiences can be gained at home, but there is an air of complacency with lasting friendships that do not stimulate new perspectives the same way that frequent travel abroad does.   


I would love to hear your opinion and perspective! I would love to be made aware if I have misinterpreted something as well. Thanks!",Stoicism,1703387116.0,t3_18pm0fq,0.58,3

Mindfulness for War Refugees / Survivors,"Hey everyone, I'm a war survivor in my mid-twenties who've found refuge in a neighboring country. The war in my home country is still ongoing and it's getting worse by the minute. During these times I struggle to pull myself away from this very intense human experience. Can't help but think about everything I lost back home and the devastating news on the daily. I'm thankful for the safety of my family and the very fact that I have a job that allows me to provide for them despite the looming reality that I'll probably be a slave to it for the rest of my life and as a stranger. This is my very first time sharing all of this into existence, and I know that human suffering can be found everywhere around the globe.

A Stoic approach to dealing with a parent who has early-alzheimer's disease?,"I'm 19 years old and my mom has early-onset alzheimer's disease. She was diagnosed at only 50. It's not been easy at all.

I wouldn't say I'm new to stoicism, I've read Meditations, Discourses, and Letters from a Stoic. I've been interested and learning about it for a few years now, since before my mom's diagnosis. The issue is that learning about it and applying it are two very different beasts, which I'm sure you all know.

It's silly, but for some reason I feel like this is a true stoic ""test"" for me: facing an insurmountable tragedy I have no way of helping.

How do I navigate the future? I understand that this is something I have no power over; it is completely out of my control. But how do I actually *apply* that to myself? When I first started learning about stoicism, it was relatively straightforward to internalize because I wasn't facing something like this. But now that I am... I'm realizing just how difficult this philosophy really is to apply when tragedy strikes. 

How do I do this? How do I navigate through this? I'm struggling so much and so any bits of advice would be more than appreciated.",Stoicism,1703360928.0,t3_18pdg05,0.81,15

Do we have to control the good in us?,"So I just woke up and started thinking about something I said yesterday. I told someone that in every human being there is good and bad and we have to accept the bad in us and learn to control it, so it doesn’t take control over us (as in overtaking us ig).

Now I’m thinking a stoic would probably tell me that we need to control our good too, as moderation is usually key. But then what’s left? Do we need some sort of balance because we can’t let go of our control of the good, because this will ultimately lead to back to the bad (e.g. maximizing joy in the moment, which leads to short term satisfaction but results in long term negative consequences (additional e.g. impulsive, reckless behavior)).

Questions about humanity and passions,"Hello there! Im new here since i just saw Stoicism in school, lol. Now, it was quite an interesting philosophy! I like it :D

But i have some questions:

Mrs Teacher told us that stoics must control their passions and use reason instead, so that way they act in a wise way. Passions arent necesarilly bad, some are good, others bad and other regular. But thats why they need to be kept under control.  If people get carried away by their passions, they dont act in a reasonable way and only cause more damage. I asked Mrs Teacher how much damage, she said ""Greed, war, hatred, etc.""

And i was like HOLY COW. 

1 - Passions really damage so much? The reason of why there is so much hatred, racism, war, greed and more, is because that most humans are passional beings and not rational beings?

2 - Also, how are we supposed to control our passions?

3 - If we somehow made that education promoted reasoning and all humanity became rational instead of passionae, how much better would the world be?

Finding meaning in life,"Stoicism has already helped me in becoming a better person. I can focus better on my studies, I go to the gym regularly now. When I have a hard time getting out of bed, I think about, what Marcus Aurelius said in Meditations:

>>At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: “I have to go to work — as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for — the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?”
So you were born to feel “nice”? Instead of doing things and experiencing them? Don’t you see the plants, the birds, the ants and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks, putting the world in order, as best they can? And you’re not willing to do your job as a human being? Why aren’t you running to do what your nature demands?
You don’t love yourself enough. Or you’d love your nature too, and what it demands of you.<<

But right now, I really struggle with finding any meaning in life. I feel depressed almost every evening because I'm thinking ""What am I doing all this for?"" The problem is that I've always found meaning in a partner. And now that I've been single for a while I'm finally wondering what else there is to live for.

How Stoicism is helping me stay alive (from suicidal ideation),"Even if I can never truly be considered a Stoic, I am determined to try my best to become as close as I can to it. For some quick background; I’ve grown up in poverty, suffered years as a child through sexual abuse, I’ve attempted suicide near the beginning of the year and have been admitted to the mental hospital 4 times this year, lost my job, evicted, cheated on (after 4.5 years) - ending my first relationship, lost all of my friends, kicked out of college etc. I am not attempting to elicit sympathy. I see suicide brought up quite often in the subreddit, so I am trying to offer my assistance. As of such, please correct me if I am misapplying and/or misinterpreting any of the ideas. 

**1. Virtue: COURAGE**
Life is feeling quite uncomfortable at the moment; Just as I believe it can’t get any worse, it just keeps throwing more and more surprises my way. Although I am working to *change* my outlook on life, my current belief is that life will not get better and I will just experience more suffering. I *suppose* that this isn’t true, but I genuinely do not believe its falsehood - **yet**. By practicing the virtue of courage I am accepting that fact and living *in spite* of that belief. As corny as it sounds: it takes courage to live. Courage is not living in the absence of fear, but to live *despite* those fears and discomforts. 

Another aspect of courage is *actually seeking professional help*, and having the courage to put my faith in these professionals’ hands. It was hard as I had ZERO faith that it would work, but lemme tell ya, **it’s working**. 

**2. Epictetus, Discourse 1.18 “That we ought not to be angry with the errors (faults) of others”**

 “*Learn that a thief and an adulterer have no place in the things which are yours, but in those which belong to others and which are not in your power. If you dismiss these things and consider them as nothing, with whom are you still angry? But so long as you value these things, be angry with yourself rather than with the thief and the adulterer.*” 

I use this concept to cope with 1: The infidelity and 2: The years of sexual abuse I’ve been through. Regarding the infidelity, their loyalty is exactly that: *their* loyalty, meaning it is theirs to give and theirs to take back whenever they please. Even if they agreed to give it to me, nothing hinders them from betraying that agreement. In this case, they have chosen to take it back, and therefore have communicated this to me through their actions. At that point, it’s up to me to decide how I respond to what they’ve communicated - we are no longer together. The decision to end it is not about hating or resenting them. If the only thing in my power is the right use of appearances, then I’ve concluded the following: It’s because I want loyalty. They’ve proven to be an unreliable source for that, and therefore it would be senseless to desire something from someone that they’ve *proven* to be unable to provide. 

**3. Epictetus as an example**
I mean come on, Epictetus has been through some awful ass shit. He is an amazing example of Stoicism at work. I have trouble following advice if the person giving the advice *only* knows the answers through theory as opposed to practical application. Epictetus completely blows that out of the water for me. If HE can do it, surely I can. 

**4. Epictetus, Discourse 1.24 “How we should struggle with circumstances”** in combination with **Discourse 1.5 “Against the Academics”**

“*It is circumstances (difficulties) which show what men are. Therefore when a difficulty falls upon you, remember that God, like a trainer of wrestlers, has matched you with a rough young man. “For what purpose?” You may say. Why, that you may become an Olympic conquerer; but it is not accomplished without sweat.*” 

“*But, you may say, there are some things disagreeable and troublesome in life. And are there none at Olympia? Are you not without comfortable means of bathing? Are you not wet when it rains? Have you not abundance of noise, clamour, and other disagreeable things? But I suppose that setting all these things off against the magnificence of the spectacle, you bear and endure. Well then and have you not received faculties by which you will be able to bear all that happens? Have you not received greatness of the soul? Have you not received manliness? Have you not received endurance? And why do I trouble myself about anything that can happen if I possess greatness of the soul? What shall distract my mind or disturb me, or appear painful? Shall I not use the power for the purposes for which I received it, and shall I grieve and lament over what happens?*” 

I have been given the faculties to deal with everything that has happened to me and everything that *can* happen to me. With that in mind, I have the knowledge that by using such faculties I am making them stronger and therefore becoming stronger myself. This, if anything, takes me RIGHT out of my suicidal episodes. Yes, the things that have happened may seem horrible, but I’ve *endured* them and grown from them. It’s like; yeah, that’s a big ass mountain, but I **climbed** that big ass mountain. THAT is what’s important. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHJHHH",Stoicism,1703303940.0,t3_18ox2tm,0.9,38

I care too much about what others think of me.,"I (19F) have found myself to become increasingly overly concerned with how others perceive me and what their opinions of me are. I don't know how keep these concerns at bay. I am plagued by this fear of others disliking me or talking bad about me behind my back so much that I spend a considerable amount of time thinking about it. I am either thinking about what exactly about my personality is so off-putting or I am thinking about how I can manufacture a false personality to make myself more laid back and appealing.

A week ago, my best friend and his family, both of which I am very close to, invited me over for dinner and this wasn't the first time that this invitation was extended to me. My best friend's brother has a new girlfriend who showed up to this dinner and although me and her had barely exchanged any words beyond a hello, it was disclosed to me that this person does not like me for whatever reason. I am so confused and my mind does cartwheels trying to figure out what I did wrong when I do my best to be personable and kind to those around me. I know this is unhealthy and I shouldn't be so wrapped up in this but I can't help it. I don't know if I even like this person and there's a likely chance my friend's brother and his girlfriend will break up in due time yet I still care too much. Heck, I don't even know when's the next time I will be in the same room as this person.

This little incident is just one example of many where information was revealed to me about or I had found out by myself that a person who I thought I was cool with no longer approves of me and it's always something stupid and simple like people unfollowing me on social media, being quiet and shut down when I enter a room, ex-friends finding excuses to leave me out of plans and hang-outs, etc, etc. I understand to many, I have a strong personality, I have a bit of a potty mouth and my sense of humor is out there but never offensive and I don't let my jokes run wild around people I have just met who might not know better. These thoughts then extend to me feeling like the least favorite of every friend group or just overall an unimpressive and forgettable friend.

How do I let go of these thoughts and this pressure I put on myself to be as likable as possible to everyone I know? I always feel inadequate. I am new to stoicism and would like to put some stoic practices in my day-to-day but I am unsure of what the appropriate  response to all this is as I feel like me getting so wrapped up in my head isn't very ""stoic"".",Stoicism,1703298503.0,t3_18ovhbg,0.92,9
My social skills are terrible,"Hello, M17 here. I'm not exactly sure how to begin explaining my situation but i'll give it my best. I've always been a very quiet person, but thing is i don't think i'm a so called ""introvert"". I want to talk to people, i like it, it makes me happy to socialize with friends but the problem is i cant. I don't know how to i guess. I'm scared to talk to strangers, though this has gotten better over the last couple of years after i've convinced myself that not everyone is negatively judging me 24/7, but my stubborness of talking to strangers is somewhat still there. And to get to the main issue, I don't know how to talk, even to people i know! I simply don't know what to say when i'm talking to somone, and so when for example i'm in a group of three, i'll just end up being next to the other two listening what they say and not contributing anything to the conversation. I try to think of something to say but nothing comes out and as i've said before, i simply don't know what to say.
I'm not sure why i'm like this, but my guess is how i grew up perhaps? When i was 4 y/o me and my mom moved to a completely new country. My mother did not know a word on the language. I don't remember much of when i started school, but i do remember i did not have friends, and this was probably in 1st grade. So really i've never had many friends either. Today i only have one truely good friend whom i am able to talk to. But as i've said, when someone else joins us, i am unable to speak, yet my friend has no problems...
I even joined my local volleyball team (because i like the sport) and I would say i'm somewhat friends with like two guys, but even then we don't hang out after practice except video games. I want to be able to join them talk after practice, but i just end up looking at them.
I'm just lost at what i should do, how can i learn to talk?

What are some good Stoic texts related to righteous indignation and not feeling anger and outrage when something doesn’t go my way?,"So I noticed I have this pattern where I get very angry when something doesn’t go my way. It feels like some great injustice has been done to me.

Rather than seeing it from a more objective perspective where it’s just a slight preference, that didn’t go my way, I get all bent out of shape and feel like it shouldn’t have gone that way, and things need to have gone differently, and I oftentimes get angry during these situations.

I’m looking for a way to change this behavior and be able to remain more levelheaded both in my behaviors outwardly, but also more importantly, in my inward feelings, as well.

Created a Self-Study Introductory Course on Stoicism,"I started reading “Daily Stoic” about a year ago, and really enjoy that is is mostly just quotes from original texts of the Stoic Philosophers. I do not really like Ryan Holiday or his anecdotes. Sometimes they are helpful for understanding the passage, but more often than not they seem pointless. So I wanted to read a mix here of modern stoic authors, while also reading some of the  primary texts. I used ChatGPT to come up with parts of this syllabus, but the texts and resources chosen are my own. Is this a good staring point? 

Course Title: Stoicism: An Exploration of Ancient Wisdom for Modern Living

Course Description:
This self-study course on Stoicism delves into the timeless principles of this ancient philosophy, providing students with a comprehensive understanding of Stoic thought and its application in contemporary life. Spanning across three credits, this course invites students on a transformative journey that combines introspection, critical analysis, and practical exercises to cultivate resilience, wisdom, and emotional well-being.
Through a carefully curated selection of texts, including the seminal works of Stoic philosophers such as Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius, students will explore the core tenets of Stoicism. They will gain practical insights into leading a life characterized by virtue, tranquility, and the pursuit of personal excellence, regardless of external circumstances.
This self-study course encourages students to actively engage with Stoic principles through a variety of mediums, including readings, video lectures, reflective journaling, and guided exercises. By fostering a sense of personal responsibility, this course empowers students to develop actionable strategies for adopting Stoic principles into their own lives.

Key areas of exploration in this course include:
1. The Stoic Mindset: Students will develop an understanding of the Stoic worldview, exploring key concepts such as virtue, nature, and personal discipline. They will examine Stoic teachings on the importance of personal choice, resilience in the face of adversity, and maintaining a focused and rational mind.
2. Emotion and Rationality: Drawing on Stoic insights, students will explore the nature of emotions and how to cultivate emotional well-being through the practice of rational thinking. They will learn to observe and evaluate their own emotional responses, gaining tools to transform negative emotions into opportunities for growth, wisdom, and tranquility.
3. The Art of Acceptance: Stoicism emphasizes accepting and embracing the realities outside of our control, enabling individuals to find peace in the face of life's uncertainties. Students will examine the Stoic concept of indifference to external events and develop strategies to manage stress, overcome obstacles, and live authentically.
4. Relationships and Virtue: Stoicism places a strong emphasis on cultivating virtuous relationships. Students will explore Stoic teachings on friendship, justice, and our responsibilities towards others. They will examine how Stoic ethics can transform their approach to social interactions, enabling them to foster healthier, more meaningful relationships.
5. Stoicism in the Modern World: Applying Stoic teachings to contemporary contexts, students will explore how Stoic philosophy can inform and enhance various aspects of their lives, including career, personal goals, and decision-making. They will analyze real-world examples and case studies, equipping them with practical tools to navigate the challenges of modern life with wisdom and equanimity.

Stoics Against Social Isolation,"I would like to discuss the stoic application of social interaction. This is in response to the frequent posts that go something like ""Due to x,y,z circumstances and events, I've decided that I'm never talking to anyone ever again, how can stoicism help me with the inevitable psychological consequences of my self-induced solitary confinement?""

I understand how someone could get an idea of the story of Seneca the Younger and him being wrongfully exiled, and I appreciate how well this story helps convey important tenants of stoicism, but I feel people run with the idea that stoicism = being alone. I also understand that Stoicism has been adopted by the ""sigma grindset"" side of social media that primarily values productivity and material success or status, which likely sends a lot of people here.

There is a concept of Oikiosis that's mostly discussed and referenced from the very early stoics like Cicero, but it's nonetheless important. My understanding of oikiosis is that it's the individual's natural instinct for self-preservation and care which extends outwards to friends and community, that helps develop an individual's moral compass. Moreover, the cardinal stoic virtue of justice does not only call for the fair treatment of others but also active contribution to the community, and this seems to be overlooked.

**In short,** if someone is dealing with a tragedy that has left them completely socially isolated, stoicism can help, but I believe, from my interpretation of the texts, that it's antithetical to stoicism to completely remove oneself from all communities. Thoughts?

**Some sources:**

""With the exception of wisdom, I'm inclined to believe that the immortal gods have given nothing better to humanity than friendship."" - Cicero

""No good thing is pleasant to possess, without friends to share it."" - Seneca

""Friendship produces between us a partnership in all our interests. There is no such thing as good or bad fortune for the individual; we live in common. And no one can live happily who has regard to himself alone and transforms everything into a question of his own utility; you must live for your neighbour, if you would live for yourself. "" - Seneca

""This is the first promise that philosophy holds out to us: fellow-feeling, humanity, sociability."" — Seneca

""Nature bore us related to one another … She instilled in us a mutual love and made us compatible … Let us hold everything in common; we stem from a common source. Our fellowship is very similar to an arch of stones, which would fall apart, if they did not reciprocally support each other"" - Seneca",Stoicism,1703274255.0,t3_18on6um,0.76,6

Does anyone else get massively dissapointed in themselves when they react based off emotion? How do you deal with that?,"Hi everyone,

How do you guys deal with reacting based off emotion?

 Lately I have been having kinda shitty days (I know this isnt an excuse) and I just sometimes do things that I very am dissapointed in.

For example just today when I was cycling back from the gym I see a family standing in the middle of the cycling lane like dumbasses. Now here's the bit im dissapointed in,  I gave the guy (I assume the dad) kinda like a death stare. Not a massive big deal I know but still.

What good does that do? Nothing. Will that prevent them from doing that again? Probably not. Will I get my ass beat if I do that to the wrong guy? Possibly. Maybe they didnt even know that they were on a cycling lane.  I immidietly after that was so dissapointed in myself. Like dude are you a baby?

I know that I am in control of my own actions/reactions. I cant control what others do or say. Some people are just not very thoughtful,(?) of others. Not everyone has the same norms and values. Maybe they were even new to the country and dont even know how the traffic rules work. I should pity them and not react in a hateful manner. But sometimes its just so grrrr, you know?

How do you guys ""catch"" yourself before reacting? I always have the stoic mindset after the fact.",Stoicism,1703270607.0,t3_18olvqw,0.96,68

""But why do not you go, then? "" says Florus. "" Because,"" re- \[p. 1011\] plied Agrippinus, "" I do not deliberate about it."" For he who once sets himself about such considerations, and goes to calculating the worth of external things, approaches very near to those who forget their own character. Why, then, do you ask me whether death or life be the more eligible? I answer, life. Pain or pleasure? I answer, pleasure. "" But if I do not act a part, I shall lose my head."" Go and act it, then, but I will not. ""Why?"" Because you esteem yourself only as one thread of many that make up the piece. ""What then?""

Understanding my own meditations,"I am fairy new to Stoicism I have been trying to write out conversations I have in my head in order to better understand myself and my emotions. I'm hoping with my recent studies of Stoicism, I am able to apply the values into my thoughts. I'd love to hear any feedback or to add some Stoic wisdom to better relate to yourself.

Why am I such an emotionally sensitive individual?

It feels like I don’t know how to take anything as a joke anymore. I used to brush everything off and laugh about it, but now I don’t know how to respond. 

No one is truly joking about anything they say. There is always some sense of truth behind their words. 

\- But people do joke, you have just been accustomed to bullying.

“I don’t see much you bring to the table other than constant sensitivity”

\- See? Bully.

Why cant a man be emotional without being ridiculed? Humans are designed to have emotion, it’s what allows you to express your soul. Men are told to remain unobstructed by any of life's mishaps. 

\- Correct. You must still allow yourself to process your own emotional reactivity to the thoughts following a specific event. 

Yes; however, we are still ridiculed for our emotions. The insecurities of others leaks out of them as they bark at  you for being able to be honest and open with yourself and your emotions. 

\- Then leave them as they were. Their thoughts and emotions don't pertain to you.  ",Stoicism,1703212842.0,t3_18o4hab,0.99,1

How to stop hating somebody and be stoic?,"Had an ugly falling out with a ""friend"" about nine months ago.  (He accused me of doing something I didn't do, and refused to accept my explanation.)

My hatred of him was infinite for awhile, and thankfully it's gotten at least a little better in recent weeks.  But plenty of hatred remains.

What's still holding me back from letting go completely?  I still have to see this person every week, because he works at a restaurant my husband & I frequent.  Obviously we aren't going to boycott the restaurant over this, but I do look forward to the day that he no longer works there.

Of the people I've actually known, my list of folks I absolutely loathe isn't very long:  An ex-boss, my brother, and the devil incarnate kid who came up from behind me when I was six years old and shoved my head into a tire rim just because.  Fortunately I no longer have to see any of them, so they (mostly) stay out of mind because they're far out of sight.

But I still have some rage when I encounter the jerk at the restaurant.  I wish nothing but bad things for him -- which isn't stoic, and I'm not proud of it.  I think my continued anger stems from the fact that at the time of kerfuffle, I could have really let him have it and told him off.  I didn't, and now it's too late.

Maybe the fact that I didn't tell him off was a form of stoicism?  I don't know.  But I'm really curious how some of you get so stoic that you can 100% tune out someone you despise, when that person is sometimes just a few feet away from you.  How do you do it?",Stoicism,1703207744.0,t3_18o2tqp,0.85,18
does any one follow the message of stoics as to think before going through with your behaviour?,"I have been reading **Art of Living** an interpretation of Epictetus lesson by Sharon Lebell.

anyways in one of the lessons the author says that before doing any course of action i should think before doing it.

i think this is a great advice and for some it's common sense but does anyone do it? i'm not saying nobody does it i'm genuinely curious cause it seems like it's so time consuming because we make more 1000 decision a day and more than 1000 action so thinking before doing anything omg that would be soul killing.

that's my opinion i know my knowledge is limited and i'm here to learn i asked because i want to learn i'm young and foolish so be easy on me please.

ps: i'm asking because i want to understand this lesson better cause throught my whole life i always said and done stupid things especially (the problem of saying stupid things and doing them only occurs when i'm around my family and that makes me so sad idk why really i really love my family and respect them.) when i'm around my family, said things i regret saying and doing. so i think this lesson if done correctly and practiced could help make me a better person. and i don't know why i'm so foolish around my family. but it is what it is.

thank you all and i hope someone could help me through this.",Stoicism,1703200863.0,t3_18o0dik,0.57,1
"Successful reframing of ""negative"" emotional reactions.","Ive recently had a light bulb moment regarding negative emotional reactions. 

A year ago I became aware of the childhood emotional neglect I faced growing up. I was completely burnt out and was unable to function at the caliber I had become accustomed to and expected from myself. This lead me to discovering CPTSD, followed by Stoicism. I'm sure the emotional neglect contributed to my negative emotional reactions, so this might seem more obvious to some.

Over the last year I would seem to grasp the Stoic philosophy, taking control over my negative emotional reactions but then a particular hardship would come along and trigger me, and make my understanding and practice of Stoicism become muddled and confusing. 

If someone was taking advantage of me or if someone was criticizing me unfairly I would become upset. I would try to work through this by telling myself ""don't worry about things that are out of my control"", ""how I respond is what's important, not what someone does"", ""judge myself on how I'm acting, don't project my morals onto others"", ""be kind to them, they are not intending to be mean, they're just ignorant"". Etc etc. Despite reading and reminding myself of Stoic philosophy, after each challenging situation I would still be upset inside. I was still feeling upset by the actions of others. I didn't know how to truly believe something that I didnt like, wasn't a negative. I also felt complacent, as if I wasn't standing up for myself in these situations. I couldn't make it all come together neatly and calmly in my mind and my gut. 

But then it hit me. How I'm viewing the hardship/unfavorable action is all wrong. I had been trying to deflect my negative reactions by looking inward for comfort, when I should have been looking inward to change my perspective. 

Below I've outlined 2 examples of my reframing and what response it yields. 

""Someone is taking advantage of me"" becomes ""someone is doing something I don't like"". Instead of having a negative emotional reaction to being taken advantage of, I now have the option to simply and matter of fact-ly communicate my needs and expectations or remove myself from the situation. Saying I am being taken advantage of is a judgement/assumption I am making of their behaviour/intention, and it makes me a victim. That's a tough pill to swallow. It comes from my own expectations of how others should act, it comes from my ego. Removing the judgement statement makes it much easier for me to respond rationally. 

""Someone is judging/criticizing me"" becomes ""i dont agree with someone's opinion of me"". Again, instead of viewing myself negatively through their eyes, which causes me to become defensive, I am simply saying we disagree on the topic, that their truth isn't THE truth. I can either express my views in a virtuous manner, agree to disagree, or consider their perspective and aim to improve if needed. My internal dialog switched from labeling myself as the problem, to labeling the problem as the problem. 

I would love hear more ""negative emotional reactions/judgements = neutral statement replacement"" that others can think of!",Stoicism,1703199062.0,t3_18nzowk,0.9,15

Purity of the Daily Stoic?,"I (like many, I assume) found Stoicism through Ryan Holiday. It resonates with me as he presents it. But, I've not yet done my own deep dives into source material.

Loving Evil People," Reading The Meditations, Marcus Aurelius says that the height of all logic that all stoics should seek out is loving every last human being. I have been contemplating this for a few weeks but keep coming to a dead end... I have felt freed by loving those who are condescending or mean to me instead of stewing in my own damaged ego or pride. However, I don't understand how I can possibly love someone like Hitler or Leopold II or other people like them who are undoubtedly horrific monsters. I understand that people are a product of their environment, but at a certain point you are making a willing choice to continue down a path of moral corruption. I can have faith that people can change, but many people (like Hitler and Leopold) will never change. How and why is it important to love those who spread hatred and death?

Eternal Return and Free Will.,"Hi!
I found the concept of Eternal Return which was practiced by Stoics, especially the earliest ones. I have got a question. 
So, according to the theory of eternal return, time is cyclical, it repeats itself and according to some posts I've seen here, it all happens over again, the same way it was before, so I understood that if there is a Glad_Communications posting this today, there was another Glad_Communications in the past cycle and there will be another one in the future cycles. And as far as my studies in Stoicism work, then nature is deterministic, which means that there are things which will inevitably happen, but we have some degree of free will according to the knowledge we have and will have, so... in that way, isn't then determinism and eternal return mutually exclusive? Because nature then would then be pre-deterministic.",Stoicism,1703177066.0,t3_18nraab,0.67,2
Book 10 opening paragraph,"At the start of book 10 Marcus says this 

“My soul, will you ever be good, simple, individual, bare, brighter than the body that covers you? Will you ever taste the disposition to love and affection? Will you ever be complete and free of need, missing nothing, desiring nothing live or lifeless for the enjoyment of pleasure?”

Can someone explain this to me in a better way than I’m currently understanding it? It seems to me like there should be no enjoyment or emotion in life other than virtue. 

Epictetus also talks about if someone leaves or someone dies you should see it as returning them.

I just got fired,"My life couldn’t get any more unfortunate lol.

I missed a shift a few weeks ago because of a technical error that didn’t notify me that I was scheduled for that day. My supervisor notified me of this and I assured her it wouldn’t happen again but there was literally no way I could have prevented this.

Fast foward to a couple weeks later and I’m scheduled for a shift that conflicts with my unavailability (another technical issue). On the day before my shift starts (2 hours in advance) I let my supervisor know that I won’t be able to attend because of a competition. She responds 4 hours later and because of competition rules, I can’t use my phone and respond to her in a timely manner. I see her message a few hours later asking me to come in late but I see that it’s past the time of the shift. Here’s where I know I messed up- I eventually end up not followingup with her as I believe it would be better just to leave things as is since I thought the situation was under control.

I message her a few days after that regarding a question and everything seems cool, no mention of any issues regarding the whole situation or anything like that. Then, I receive an email on Monday saying that I’m being terminated for my low availability (this was the topic of the question i messaged to her) and that I’ve had two no-shows with little communication.

I feel like I properly communicated for the first one and I see my mistake in the second but I just can’t help but feel a bit distraught.

My childhood haunts me.,"I never had the chance to meet my father. My mother was overprotective and kepr me from forming independence. I was bullied in school, graduated friendless, obese, with a bad posture, no marketable skills, destined for failure.

I've been focused on turning this story around, in every aspect, physical and financial especially. The way I deal with this all that happened is to not think about it, not talk about it, not mention it. People tell me should forgive the people who hurted me and my mother, I can't. I will be aknowledging that what they've done was okay and let them go out without consequence. I was the one everyone was stepping on for 18 years, I won't let this happen again. I have acostumed myself to the idea of living life alone. No family, no friends, no allies. Just me and my goals.

But recently, all of this has been gnawing at me like a ghost and it has been compromising my performance in the things I am working for. I don't want to go to a therapist. How do I deal with this myself?",Stoicism,1703123050.0,t3_18nb7q7,0.89,20
Stressed about money and future and status and happiness,"NOTE: I have ADHD and Crohn's, which I think influences why I feel this way. I'm posting here because I've found Stoicism helpful in the past and I think people here will have a unique perspective on this. 

&#x200B;

I naturally stay up late and wake up late. When I don't have external demands on me, I tend to sleep between 2am and 4am and wake up between 10am and 1pm. 

Obviously, when I was in school, I had to be there from 8-4 ish every day (well, excluding the large amount of days I skipped or left at lunch or showed up after lunch). I honestly can't remember how I did it. I think I was usually just groggy and annoyed for a few hours and then felt better as the day went on. 

After college, I tried to work various jobs that started in the morning, around 8 or 9. I quit all of them relatively quickly because I just hated getting up so early. I hated feeling rushed. I hated not having time to eat breakfast or have coffee or tea. I hated driving to work in rush hour traffic. 

After a couple years I went to Korea to teach in an afterschool English academy. My hours were 3pm-10pm ish. It was awesome. I'd get up, enjoy my morning, go for a hike or something, eat lunch, and head to class feeling good. My job was fun and I was good at it. Then I'd relax at night or walk around or whatever I wanted and just go to sleep when I felt tired. 

The problem is as I'm getting older I'm a bit stressed about money and the future and all that stuff. My job in Korea provided a free apartment, but the salary wasn't much. I could save a few hundred dollars a month if I tried. I came back to the US after 2 years with about 4 grand. 

I applied to a bunch of jobs in the US. The two interviews I got were car salesman (which sounded terrible and would have me working like 10 hours a day) and concessions at the movie theater (which I took and I'm enjoying, but obviously the money is very little). 

I've thought about ways I could make more money and I basically came up with 3 options. 

1) Do something online like writing or making videos or learning to code- This would be good because of flexibility, but it's hard to predict whether you will be successful. Also, I tend to get down if I don't socialize for awhile. I get energy from being around people and I don't know if I could be happy sitting in my room for 8 hours a day. 

2) Become a ""real"" teacher- This would require me to get a teaching license and/or masters degree. I could potentially end up working in international schools, which sounds cool. They also get paid a lot better than academy teachers. But from what I've heard, you generally have to spend 2 years teaching in the US or an undesirable country before you get a job somewhere I'd want to live. I really don't want to do that. And honestly, I don't want to go back to the school schedule, waking up at 6 or 7am. And I don't want to teach big classes, like 30-40 kids. The max at my old job was 12 and even that felt a bit much to me. 

3) Go to law school- I did well in debate, majored in philosophy, and got a good score on a practice LSAT. I think I have the skills to excel in this. But working as a lawyer requires a 9-5 type job (or worse if you want to make a lot of money). And also I think a lot of it will be boring and tedious and ethically grey, which I don't like. When I think about it, I did well in debate, but it also stressed me out a lot and I could get mad when judges were stupid or people were mean to me. 

&#x200B;

So, as you can see, I have no idea what to do next haha. I think two of the biggest things holding me back are not wanting to work a ""normal"" schedule or live in places I don't want to live in. To be honest, what I want to do is go back to working in an academy in Korea. I think I was the happiest I've ever been there and I miss it. But I'm scared of not making much money as I get older. 

I don't really care much about money myself. I really wish I didn't have to think about it. I kind of hate thinking about it. But it's important for security, in case of emergencies or what not. And I'm worried about my ability to date or get married as I get older if I don't start making more money. Most girls I dated in my 20's didn't seem to care, but will they if I'm in my 30s and still not making a lot? 

Anyone relate to this or have any advice? 

My dad wants me to go to law school and I think my mom wants me to get a masters in education, but I think I might end up hating either one. I want to go back to teaching in an academy, but I'm worried and feel I might be embarrassed to still be doing that in my 30s. I turn 30 in October.

How would stoics view modernity?,"
Modern day hook up culture plaguing the youth, wide spread availability of drugs, instant pleasure at our finger tips, no real commitments to anything, hyper active behavior everywhere, no real search for meaning, feminization of men, wide spread obesity, being a father or mother is seen as a ""waste"", lust and greed driven, etc...

I could go on with hundreds more but you clearly get the picture.

Before you say, ""that's a minority group and your spending to much time on social media...🤓"" I agree it is a minority, however, I lump it all together to create what I would consider a small majority group, or at least maybe that's where it's heading.

I dont really consume any social media and I'm not some old guy behind the times. I'm really young and I just like philosiphy.

So back to the question:

How would stoics, like Marcus Aurelius or Seneca, view our society today? Is it much different than theirs at the time? Also, what would they say to us in regards to how we should live, or what we can do to change?

Is this Stoicism?,"I read a book by the famous historical polymath ibn Hazm and something in my mind says its stoic.

He wrote:

""These words encapsulate all 
virtue: to control oneself against passion means in fact to turn 
away from one’s natural tendency towards anger and lust, 
things which are both under the dictates of passion. Then all 
that is left for the soul to use is the intellect which God has 
given it, the good sense which distinguishes it from the beasts, 
from insects or vermin and from tigers. “Never lose your 
temper,” as Allah’s Prophet (peace be upon him) said to a 120
man asking advice, and, as he also said commanding him, “Do 
as you would be done by” , together encapsulate the whole of 121
virtue


He further writes about the goal of all humans and all nations, 
“I have tried to find one goal which everyone would agree to be 
excellent and worthy of being striven after. I have found one 
only: to be free from anxiety. When I reflected upon it, I 
realized that not only do all agree in valuing it and desiring it, 
but I also perceived that, despite their many different passions 
and aspirations and preoccupations and desires, they never 
make the slightest gesture unless it is designed to drive anxiety 
far away. One man loses his way, another comes close to going 
wrong, finally another is successful - but he is a rare man, and 
success is rare, (O all-knowing Allah). Dispelling anxiety is a 
goal upon which all nations agree from the time when the 
Almighty created the world until the day when this world will 
pass away and be followed by the Day of Judgment - and their 
actions are directed to this goal alone. In the case of every 
other objective there will always be some people who do not 
desire it. For example, some people are not religious and do 
not take eternity into account. There are some who by nature 
and inclination prefer obscurity to fame [the obscurity of 
satisfied passion]. There are some who have no interest in 
amassing a fortune, preferring abstinence to ownership; this 
was the case with many of the Prophets. May peace be upon 
them all - and those who followed their example, ascetics and 
philosophers. There are some who by nature dislike sensual 
pleasures and scorn those who seek after them, such as those 
men we have just mentioned, and who prefer to lose a fortune 
rather than gain one. Some prefer ignorance to knowledge, in 
fact most of the people that you see in the street are like this. 
These are the objectives of people who have no other aim in 
life. Nobody in the whole world, from the time of its creation 
until its end, would deliberately choose anxiety, and would not 
desire to drive it far away. When I had arrived at this great 
piece of wisdom, when I had discovered this amazing secret, 
when Allah the Almighty had opened the eyes of my mind.


it should refrain from this passion, and the [Prophet’s] 
commandment to do as you would be done implies that the 
souls should turn away from the strong force of greed and lust 
and should uphold the authority or the means of justice which 
springs from the rationality which is part of the reasonable soul. 
I have seen the majority of people - except those who God the 
Almighty has protected, and they are few - throw themselves 
into the miseries, the worries and fatigues of this world, and 
pile up a mountain of sin which will mean that they enter 
hellfire in the Hereafter and will have no advantage from the 
perfidious intentions which they nurse so carefully, such as 
wishing for an inflation of prices which would bring disaster 
upon the children, the innocent, or wishing the worst trials 
upon those they hate. They know very well that these bad 
intentions will not necessarily bring about what they desire or 
guarantee its advent, and if they clarified and improved their 
intentions they would hasten the repose of their spirits. They 
would then have the time to devote themselves to their own 
business and would thus profit a great deal in addition to the 
return of their souls to God, and all this without having at all 
hastened or delayed the realization of their desires. Is there any 
worse deception than the attitude which we warn against here, 
and is there any greater happiness than the one which we are 
promoting?”122

Need help understanding,"Hello all, I'm 25(M) new to these pracitices. I would like to say right away I know reddit is not the best place to come to for advice. I feel lost, alone and not understood. Posting here as i don't really know what else to do other than seek anonymous help and what others opinions are. 

I have a really hard time either processing emotions or understanding them. I messed up yesterday and freaked out, all because I felt like an idiot because I kept pushing a place to go for vacation that people couldn't afford. Was not upset about that at all, more so because I was embarrassed and feel bad they didn't tell me and told my brother. It doesn't even make sense. I'm trying to figure out why I get like this. I'm starting to think I have emotional baggage that I haven't processed yet that causes me to act this way. My confidence is so low already and always feeling so unsure about myself might be a root cause?

I want to start learning and practicing stoicism so I can control my emotions. An old friend told me a couple months ago that I used to be so happy and care free. Didn't really hit me till now that they are right. I also think because I gained weight back that I lost 5 years ago that I'm not feeling myself.

Dichotomy on Control as an argument about Identity,"Here is something I've been considering that I wanted to get the community's opinion on. I think that the dichotomy of control is better understood as an argument about **identity** (what we fundamentally are), than an argument about control, influence, or cause. 

The Handbook introduces the Dichotomy of control as follows: ""Some things are within our power, while others are not. Within our power are opinion, motivation, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever is of our own doing; not within our power are our body, our property, reputation, office, and, in a word, whatever is not of our own doing."" ( Handbook 1.1 Hard Translation).

Most people take this to mean that there are three things are play:

1. Us (who we are)
2. The things up to us (Opinion, motivation, desire)
3. The things not up to us (body, our property, reputation).

Instead, I think the argument is better thought of as this:   
1. There are the things that we ARE, that make up our identity (our opinions and desires).  
2. There are the things that we ARE NOT, that don't make up our identity (our body, our reputation).

Therefore, we should focus on improving and caring about what we fundamentally are. Our life goes better when WE are better (better opinions, better desires). Our life does not go worse when things WE ARE NOT get damaged (our office, our property). The DOC then is not about describing what we can or can't control, but about where the limits of our identity lie, which technically for Epictetus is our Prohairesis (our faculty of choice).

It is a change in the emphasis of the argument. Epictetus is not *just* saying that we suffer when we try to control what is outside our control (although that is true). He is emphasizing that we suffer when we identify ourselves with the things that are not up to us. When we think something belongs to us (is up to us) that doesn't.

This is why in Discourses 1.1 Epictetus focuses so much on personal identity. He presents an example with a tyrant: ""'Tell me your secrets.' I won't reveal them; for that lies within my power. 'Then I'll have you chained up.' What are you saying, man, chain *me* up? You can chain my leg, but not even Zeus can overcome my power of choice (prohairesis). 'I'll throw you into prison.' You mean my poor body.""

The humour in this passage is that the tyrant is trying to threaten Epictetus, but the tyrant is applying a non-Stoic perspective. He is threatening Epictetus' body, but Epictetus realizes that he is not his body and so he is not intimidated. He is his character, his prohairesis, his capacity to make choices. That is what applying the Dichotomy of control looks like in action, not just saying ""oh well, I can't control what you do."".

How to avoid letting stoicism cause dismissiveness?,"“What can I do about my brothers anger?”

Nothing. You can do nothing about it. But you can control your response to his anger” I.e. don’t get angry just because he’s angry

This is true and it’s valuable to focus on not letting other people’s reactions cause you to react in a similar way

But at the same time, this feels pretty black and white. Maybe you can help your brother with his anger by asking what’s going on to cause it, maybe you did something that understandably contributed to his anger, and it’s unfair for you to say “hm his anger is his own problem, nothing I can do”. 

I guess what I’m asking is this: it seems that taking stoic lessons perfectly literally can cause some unfavorable interpersonal dynamics. Do you agree or disagree?",Stoicism,1703077627.0,t3_18mu6dh,0.87,12
I feel guilty and scared of my emotional responses,"Yesterday I had what started as a funny argument on a random topic. My sister and my husband had an opposite view as mine and both of them where interrupting me while I was trying to speak. I said “Shut the fuck up” which was meant in a jokingly way but my face showed my frustration of being repeatedly interrupted. They both said wow that’s not cool and I apologised on the spot. My sister got really triggered and threw in my face that I cry when someone tells me something that hurts my feelings but I say things like that when I am angry. Also I confess that lately I feel very emotional when I see my sister and my husband “coming together “ against me.

The point is that she has a point. I am a very sensitive person, I get emotional very easily and I just want to stop reacting. I feel like I always says something wrong and I feel terrible and insecure afterwards. I feel like I am a bad person for having these reactions. It looks like everyone can be cool and easy going but me, like I am always making mistakes and that the people I love will get tired of me.

Should I avoid confrontation? How can I be a better, wiser person? How do I deal with my insecurities?

I write this in this page because I am trying to learn stoicism. I spend most of my days alone at home and I feel happy and at peace. Then I am tested with actual people, and people are just hard form me. Any stoic material suggestions are appreciated.

What should a stoic define as true power?,"I'm in a career which gives me a lot of responsibility and authority but it tends to become fairly political. Due to this, mentors and advisors frequently recommend books like The Prince or the 48 Laws of Power. However, these books don't align with the values of a stoic and are ruthlessly pragmatic. I'm not sure how to incorporate the understanding I have gathered from these while maintaining my character.
The question I want to explore is how should I view power as a stoic, especially when the choices I make effect the lives of others. I literally hold people's lives in my hands due to my career, so do I owe it to them to be as ruthlessly pragmatic as possible?

Talk only when needed?,"After countless conversations I had with people, I am thinking about not getting involved in conversations.

Whenever I try to have a conversation, I try to be as close to reality as possible, instead of having my opinions or my conditioning. People most often take it offensive and project their hatred towards me.

Some people try to shut me off by saying I sound like a philosopher. Some people appreciate it though. 

It feels exhausting. I start to question why do I even have these conversations in the first place.

People often can't really accept reality. I don't know every truth ever. But I can perceive it to some extent.

To me a conversation is about exchange of information to learn and grow. There is some amount of egoic identity involved as well personally. I am not going to deny it. Still learning to not take it personally when I am defeated and trying to learn from it. 

I right now feel like I only need to talk when there is something gonna change if I contribute to the conversation. If things are not going to change, then why even take part in the conversation? 

If both the parties learn and grow, then it's fine. Or else observation and silence is better I guess.

My mother is a housewife with only a high-school diploma. I passed my graduation and I have been trying for job for 6 years but to no hope whatsoever in the horizon. I did a lot of odd jobs and with recession in the country lost the current job I have. I'm have been trying for quite some time but it's to no avail.

"Loved Meditations, STRUGGLING with Discourses","I read the Hayes translations of Meditations and loved it.  I then went to the Haward Morse audiobook of Discourses (Gregory Long translation.)  I'm STRUGGLING, with entire sentences, paragraphs passing by with little comprehension. The heavy English accent and old translation, combined with the fact that I consume these as audiobooks while doing long distance running, has me wondering if I'm wasting my time (7.5 more hours to go).

I'm trying to decide do I:

1. Quit, start over with a new translation and narrator, or
2. Suffer through it, or
3. Quit entirely and instead read a modern distillation of Stoicism (""The Daily Stoic"" or other)?

Then all that hope was thrashed into peices. bassically this kid that i was sort of friends with made this rumor about me saying that i leaked his home adress. This was a blow as i thought this kid was my friend. Then my popualarity and reputation that i once had crumbled. I thought this was the deepest pit of hell a man can face, all his friends who he realises are fake leaving him, although it got worse, so much more worse. Then he added  me to this group chat on snapchat and got this kid to threaten me and press me, no matter how much i tried to explain they would not understamd the truth. They forced me to confess to somthing i did not do under the threat of a beating. And i thought that that was it, it got worse, this was probably the first time i experienced real trauma, and im only a highschooler. They added me to another chat with 15 other kids, who were all gang affiliated although in highschool and they threatened me, harrased me and even said they would stab me. Those thoughts keep me up at night. Anyways i kept this all to myself, my pearents did not need added stress, and i was forced to pay these people 20$ to let me live. It got worse, the next weekend i had a family gathering, in wich took my mind of taht trauma, on monday i checked my snapchat, apparently over the weekend i was placed in another groupchat with even more kids, giving more death threats to me. the things they said made my shiver, i gave one $20 now they all wanted up to 50$ saying they wanted a new vape or a new knife. But when they did not get a response from me as i was busy with the gathering and hanging out with my cousins. They moved on to 3 other kids, pressing them, death threating them, they sent images of their guns and knives and vapes to them, and even took $50 from them. I could not let this slide, i had to make sure this would nto happen again, i got another phone and recorded the whole conversation,this way they would not know i collected this. That should atleast send them to juvie right? But i wanna tell the authorities in a way that would not let them know that i was the snitch, cos if they find out man then idk what will happen... anyways its been 3 weeks, school break has started,i deleted my snap account and blocked them all, i only have my family and becaus of erliar events no friends to spend the break with. I intend to spend the next year hiding from them all, taking a new route home, spending my breakes in the libary. But those thoughtsv still haunt me. I dont know what to do.

Appreciation Post,"Hey everyone. 

I’m quite new to Stoicism (Ive been reading a couple of books and texts over the past 6/7 months) and i find myself looking up topics on this sub every time i find myself in a tricky spot. I wanted to thank you all for being here and providing useful information for people like me that are complete beginners. It’s amazing that we can all come together and help eachother learn and progress.

I found out tonight that my girlfriend cheated on me. Thanks to Stoicism, I feel quite good (all things considered). I have a long way to go, but I feel like a better man and i cant wait to keep practicing and reading.

My father is an enigma..,"I [33M], like many, used to think as my father as stoic, however, he's gotten soft and depressed in his older age, especially now that he's retired. Not that he's accomplished a  great deal in his life, but he raised me right, taught me how to be a strong leader, and remain unbothered by external happenings.

I enjoy giving him this credit but I've also done a fair bit of development personally, professionally, emotionally, spiritually, and have had other mentors over the last 5-10 years. I've also became a father myself this year and am learning from that. I often wonder, am I giving him too much credit for the man I am today?

What's bothering me tonight is that my father did not show up to the family Christmas party. There is no bad blood in the family either and although we only get together a few times a year, it's something he always looks forward to. Every time.

So goddamnit, why would you no-show?

I suspect he may have something going on with his health and doesn't want to face his kids. I fear that it may be bad enough to where he can't do anything about it.

Observation from Beyond Good and Evil regarding criticism of Stoicism,"I am working my way through Beyond Good and Evil for the first time. In book two, Nietzsche goes on a tirade against a few different philosophies - including Stoicism. In it, he mocked the Stoics for wanting to live in accord with nature and basically said the Stoics imprint their own morality onto nature this way and that nature is ultimately indifferent. 

Then, later in book III he is talking about religious people and specifically about Christianity in Europe. In this section he says:

“Then, during the moral epoch of mankind, one sacrificed to one’s God one’s own strongest instincts, one’s “nature“: this festive joy lights up the cruel eyes of the aesthetic, the “anti-natural” enthusiast.”


Seems to me like this definition of nature that he claims is being sacrificed is rather close to the Stoic idea of acting within one’s own nature. To “live according to one’s nature” as I understand it (correct me if I am wrong) means, broadly for humans, living in according with what makes humans unique - their ability to reason. 


Does it seem like his argument about sacrificing one’s nature seems to go against the argument he made against stoicism? In my reading it seems like he miss-characterized what “nature” is in the stoic context and then, albeit loosely, admitted to the existence of “nature” in the form the stoics use by conceding some people do sacrifice their nature.

I could be reading too much into it, any thoughts from someone more versed in Nietzsche and Stoic thought?",Stoicism,1702945878.0,t3_18locod,0.73,5

Tochange thoughts or actions?,"In a recent post, u/home_iswherethedogis commented:

>The only solution to cognitive dissonance is to change your actions. Sure, you can change your beliefs (opinions) about cigarettes to ""oh, I'm young, I'll worry about my lungs later,"" but this will keep you stuck in smoking because you can't change a habit without changing the belief surrounding it. 

Id like to discuss this specific part further. For this given example, in the end clinically smoking is bad for humans. The resolutions given when boiled down were change thoughts or change actions.

In a different case: Maybe someone percieves that their work environment is rather hostile to them. When in reality, everyone thinks they're mediocre at worst. They could change their actions in the form of a job change, or change the way they perceive the work environment.

Point being, if one decides to change something, how do they decide on how to change? Maybe this dips a little too far into the ""Stoicism is not a replacement for therapy"", maybe I'm getting too far into the weeds of it and it really is as simple as ""it depends""

I can’t cry anymore.,"Hi everyone,

I am on my stoicism journey since one and a half year. I love the idea of controlling myself, my thoughts, my emotions & my actions. Sometimes I am driven by external circumstances, but I think that I am making a great progress in quickly realising what is under my control and what is not.

The reason:
Since 2 months I am experiencing a downfall of my relationship. I know my faults, I know what I did wrong, and I am taking a full responsibility of changing those things. Simply saing - my fault is that I was controlling. 

But everything seems that there is nothing left to save - my woman is extremely passive-agressive towards me, almost to the point that I question my own humanity. She makes me feel like a monster. Someone that is not worth fighting for.

I live in a constant state of alert, wondering when the day of saying goodbye comes. One day everything seems fine, and the second day she strikes me right in my heart. And yet, I don’t feel sad. I don’t know how to blame her for being shitty because I know her behaviour is not under my control. At the same time I can’t stop loving her, because I see those good days we have had.

She might be doing this to break me & make me pull the trigger first, so I will be a „bad” one in this relationship. The one that decided to left. Or she might be testing me if I am all into really changing my behaviour.

The question:
The thing that bothers me the most is that I used to be a very emotional man, but I can’t dive into my feelings anymore. I used to cry when I was upset or sad, but I can’t do it anymore. I just can’t. And I know everything would be much easier for me if I could. 

Can it be an early stage of depression? What the #%@! should I do? What the virtuous, spiritual man would do being in my place? I know some things, but I definitely don’t know what to do in that exact situation. God, please, give me strength & courage to do the right thing.",Stoicism,1702941541.0,t3_18lmq9q,0.74,2
I feel an immense amount of guilt over kicking my brother out of my house after renting a room from me for 3 years.,"We are still talking, we are still on as good of terms as we could be on. He’s moved in with our parents. We’ve been fighting on and off for about a year and a half. About 7 months ago I told him he needs to find a new place, Listing the damage he’s done to my house and the constantly struggling to keep up with rent. Well on Monday we got into a fight. I told him he should find another place to stay once he got belligerent. I suspect drugs or alcohol may have been involved. On his way out he threw a bag through my front window (it’s a huge window that takes up the entire wall). I told him he’s not welcomed back after that. I don’t know why I feel so much guilt over this. I think I’ve made the right decision. Please let me know your thoughts.",Stoicism,1702933738.0,t3_18ljmpy,0.96,25
Explaining Mortality and Death To Small Kids,"Curious to get some perspective. 

My five year old son will make a wish blowing out a birthday candle or something and I always tell him I hope all his wishes come true.  The other day he said, he has a wish that he know won't come true and then whispered ""I don't want to die"".  He then said he also doesn't want me or other family members to die.  

It's odd how over the past several years studying stoicism I've just fallen into the habit of contemplating my mortality and that of my loved ones on a near daily basis.  This might sound incredibly depressing to some, but it's really not.  Rather I see it as just being aware of how nature works and it also gives perspective into what I think is important to do with the present moment.  It's also amazing how this habit has cleared up some fears and self-doubt, but I digress.  

I've gotten into the habit of thinking before I speak.  I think it's a good habit, otherwise I might have said something like: ""you're right, we're all going to die eventually and that's just how things work but try to not let it bother you"" or some other thing that probably wouldn't really be beneficial for either of us.  Instead I just said ""it's important to focus on the time we have right now and enjoy the present moment of being here with each other"" and gave him a big hug.  

I feel like I somewhat avoided the question and have been thinking of other ways that I could respond, so appreciate any other perspectives.  

Thanks!

Afterwards, I found out directly from her that I wanted to talk with her about us, although she did not, and that I behaved like a condescending jerk. She did not want to elaborate further, simply stating 'drunk men's words are sober man's thoughts', so I don't know my behaviour specificaly (and I really fear it could have been even worse). Of course I apologized and promised it won't happen again, giving myself a word I will further limit my occasional alcohol consumption. However, I have never thought I could behave like this and feel that I have deeply let myself down.

A visualization/realization I've been having,"I thought I would share this in hopes sometime else has success with it.

I've studied Taoism in the past, and although I find it really similar to Stoicism, they go about things so differently.  Taoism seems to focus on truly accepting the things we can't change, while stoicism focuses on making the changes we with what we have.

With Taoism, I would do meditations where I imagined having an energy/chi inside me providing me with stability and warmth.  It's been very relaxing and calming to do this, especially while anxious.  So I decided to see how I could apply this to Stoicism.

When I think about what I can really change, it comes down to literally moving my hands, getting up, etc. way more than making money out something abstract as that.  So with that, I've been imagining the same ball of energy I used to keep on the inside, but just barely outside of me.  The gravity of it almost pulls me to motion and helps me see I am in control of myself completely and not ""stuck to the couch"" or whatever.

As a last note, these are purely meditations and figments of the imagination.  I see visualisation of my chi as similar to a *dogmata* or *mantra*, not something real or tangible.",Stoicism,1702876503.0,t3_18l0zkb,0.6,1

How to deal with expectations of recognition for doing the right thing?,"I've been interested in stoicism for a few years, and although I wouldn't say I'm an avid student of it, I do try to implement the stoic virtues and practices in my life.

By doing this, I find that often I choose the path of righteousness, of forgiveness, and seldom do I seek revenge or do evil.

My problem, however, is that I keep expecting recognition for doing such things. I feel like I deserve congratulations for making the rigth choices and doing the right acts. And I realize this corrupts my initial intentions as a whole. To the point where I can't tell when I'm doing good because I am virtuous and when I'm doing it to be percieved as good and mature.

To give you an example, I recently ended a friends with benefits kind of relationship, and this person is now dating my best friend. Note that I told my friend beforehand that if he was interested in her, I wouldn't be a problem and he could go for it. I had also told her during our arrangement that if she was interested in him, it would be okay, and she could just tell me and we'd end our relationship for the sake of theirs (because I didn't want a commitment with her, and they both wanted it).

She did not tell me she was interested, but she showed clear signs. She was quite disrespectful and hurtful to me a few times due to her inability to perceive and communicate her feelings. And I just did what was best for me and ended things between us.

And now, all I can fathom is that I made their relationship possible, and I feel like both her and my friend should thank me for it.

How do I get rid of this expectation? I've been reading Meditations but to no avail thus far.

"Not sure what the point of this post is, maybe just to get things off my mind."," 

Im a 20-year-old guy who recently wrapped up my gap year with a lot of hard work. Despite earning good money, I didn't save any. I spent it on a car and started but never finished my driving license. Now, the car sits unused, and another insurance payment is coming up.

Most of my earnings went into partying and, unfortunately, drugs. Thankfully, I've kicked that habit and don't feel the urge anymore—except when I drink, which is rare now. I've started university but missed three months of classes. I want to contact university about my situation but im scared they will kick me out for not doing any work at all. I like my course and the topics, but I can't bring myself to engage. I label myself as lazy, but when I attempt something, I can't seem to enjoy it.

While I hesitate to say I'm depressed, I feel lost. I enjoy life, people, even the ""bad"" ones, but I struggle to like myself or work on self-improvement. I have a wonderful girlfriend, and I know I'm smart, but when things start improving, I feel out of place, and they take a downturn again.

Two years ago, I lost my dad to alcohol, went through a breakup, and lost a friend, all in one year. Looking back, that seems to be when things started spiraling, and im not looking for an excuse, i cannot control that. 

I often compare myself to my successful sister, measuring my worth by materialistic standards, despite knowing it's not a healthy approach.

Today, my MacBook screen broke, adding to my stress as repairs will strain my already dead budget, but life continues with or with out. I'm not sure if this post even makes sense, but I felt the need to write and seek constructive criticism or just an understanding ear. It's strange—I know what I need to do, but I'm just not doing it. I'm trying, but it's all so confusing. This may sound like a cry for help, and I'm aware of that. I appreciate stoicism and the people here, and I just wanted to unload my thoughts.

If most of this doesnt make sense, dont worry, it doesnt in my head also.

Does being virtuous becomes easier and easier the more virtuous you become?,"Today I was thinking about why I had no will to do what I'm supposed to do(study some engineering concepts), my mind keeps creating like mechanisms for me to think ""why would I suffer studying, maybe I am having a burnout?(lol)"" and then, when the end of the day comes and I did nothing, I feel like shit. Like, if virtue is the only true source of happiness then why is it so hard to act virtuously. Then I came across a possible explanation: The starting of becoming virtuous is extra hard, because of the vices you already have, the thoughts and opinions you already formed, and that's why the start is so painful. But when you're in this journey for more time it becomes easier to act virtuously. Is this right? Or will it be hard like this forever?

"A question about Risk, its worthiness and untimely death","Hello, 
I've been thinking of taking up some activities ( motorcycling, horse riding , a career that's risky in terms of mortality) that are sort of risky but am afraid of doing them for fear of injury or worse.

All my life I've erred on the side of caution, taking only calculated risks where the risks seems worthy enough, if the possibility of danger was even nominal I'd back off ( for example, i recently decided not to do river rafting). I am not lacking in courage but feel it best only to take risks that are ""worth it"".

Now I've been through some of the writings of George RR Martin and while its fiction in it a good number of characters -- good and bad die in the both unexpected and gruesome ways never fulfilling their destiny or their potential for great and noble things.

It also reminded me of Alexander The Great who wanted to conquer the world but died of Malaria, the second of the Mughal conquerers Humayan who died -- by falling from stairs in a library! 

The last great Hindu king who came from nothing but died from a single stray arrow hitting the only small single gap in his armor, Christopher reeves who fell from horseback and got paralyzed..any many other examples.

It makes me feel its better to stick to only necessary things. 

Why take these risks (motorcycling, horse riding) at all? I can make go through it for the career

This makes me afraid, what if i take any of these risks and get scared injured or die ...never even beginning to have fulfilled my duties or potential? 

P.S. I understand about the dichotomy of control and am not scared of death as a concept ( Death smiles at all men...all a man can do is smile back)..but the timing and worthiness of it",Stoicism,1702818583.0,t3_18kh0t8,0.71,4

I base my self worth/happiness on amount of friends i have or people texting or chasing me. How do i stop hating my self?,"I hate that im a people pleaser, or my behaviors are, i just dont know what to do. Im sick of people pleasing, tired of chasing others and no one chasing me, and sometimes im jealous of guys that have girls chasing them. 

I base my self worth on how others react to me. And i constantly tell my self that there is more to life than girls, friends, texting, and need to focus on my self and improve in life, and not be scared of being alone.. 

Im 22. Im tired of being angry at my self, angry for not learning, angry for not improving, angry for sending a ton of texts and getting 0 replies, im angry at my self because I know im the problem not the people. 


I know I need to learn to be better at talking and speaking in general. Having my own hobbies and dreams and goals, and stop being a ""nice guy"" just to fucking please others. But I don't want to be dick either. I want to set my own boundaries. And also be respectful at the same time. I want to be kind and interested in others.

Stoic View on Entertainment,"I recently watched All Quiet on the Western Front and enjoyed it.  I didn’t spend time analyzing my judgments about the movie while it’s happening as that would distract me from the plot. I just let my emotions run without questioning them. 

While watching movies I allow myself to get emotionally invested in the characters and the overall narrative for the duration of the film. A large part of the enjoyment I get out of reading fiction is from getting caught up in narrative, and viewing the world through the characters perspectives. These characters are usually flawed in some ways of course and are going to have errors in their reasoning.  Similarly, a large part of watching live sports is rooting for a team. 

Would a stoic forgo these aspects of entertainment for the sake of virtue?  If so, do those of you strictly practicing stoicism miss these pastimes?

How do those of you currently practicing stoicism regard movies, novels, and similar entertainment? 

How did early stoics view entertainment like poetry, music, and fiction?",Stoicism,1702808847.0,t3_18keicx,0.58,2

A unique and frustrating relationship (need good stoic advice),"Hey everyone. I consider myself an amateur stoic; have read Aurelius and Seneca and am currently reading Epictetus. 

A little background: So I had a 5+ year relationship that ended late 2021. We ended up remaining best friends to this day. Since then, I wanted to get back with her, but have tabled it due to her wanted to work on herself and heal some personal trauma(due to school and family deaths). Throughout the process, I have really tried to be patient, but the past 6 months or so I have been losing my patience with the situation.

The real issue: I am fine with the whole “single” dynamic and letting her heal on her own. However, I do have personal sexual needs that are not being met (I have high sex drive). The last time we had sex was Jan 2022. We live together in seperate rooms but still kiss and maintain a closeness. I have tried to work with her and be patient and understanding but there have been so many times where something can happen and she pulls away. At this point, seeing how much I am hurting, she has told me to look elsewhere to get what I need. The problem with this is that I am devoted to her and am not looking for sex in that kind of way. I am at my breaking point. It not like I am addicted or am falling prey to my desires, as I have done without for past 2 years. But I also want to experience fun and life. 

Stoicism has definitely helped me maintain the past year. But the lack of any progress coupled with my inability to move on is shaking me. Reading Seneca and how he talks about time makes this situation feel all the more urgent to me…

Would love some good advice. Thanks for reading✌️",Stoicism,1702806429.0,t3_18kdxph,0.5,0

Stoicism for Action,"These are four principles I've written up for myself regarding Stoic action, expressing my view that Stoicism demands service to others in order to live in accordance with nature. 

I've followed each with a personal description and some of my favorite quotes regarding the matter, and included some various links to relevant articles (I <3 Donald Robertson). This is not meant to be a comprehensive defense of that view but sharing my personal reflections on it. 

&#x200B;

1. [The Common Good](https://modernstoicism.com/perspectives-the-stoics-on-the-community-of-humankind/) —> All our aims and actions should be directed towards benefitting the common good, as is in line with natural conduct and the path of virtuous action. We are temperate and courageous so we may [advocate for justice](https://www.orionphilosophy.com/stoic-blog/the-stoic-virtue-of-justice), not for tranquility or our own happiness.
   1. The pursuit of virtue, of justice among people, is that of virtuous action. To act with love, kindness, and compassion towards all others as one humanity; to engage, not withdraw, from public involvement.
   2. *“Born for society, \[the Stoics\] all believed it was their destiny to labor for it; with so much the less fatigue, their rewards were all inside themselves. Happy by their philosophy alone, it seemed as if only the happiness of others could increase theirs.”* (Montesquieu, The Spirit of Laws, 1748)
   3. *“Revere the gods, and look after each other. Life is short — the fruit of this life is a good character and acts for the common good.”* (Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations*, 6.30)
   4. *""The primary mission of the Stoics, in other words, is to be helpful to others and serve the greater good, and they don't do this to make themselves happy. They do it becaues it is the right and natural way to live. But doing it in that spirit, as it turns out, makes them happy.""* (Ward Farnsworth, *The Practicing Stoic*, 208)
   5. *""\[Happiness is found indirectly in the pursuit of other things, which as\] proposed by the Stoic consists primarily of a dedication to reason and a commitment to others -- to service, to justice, to helping in the ways one can.""* (Ward Farnsworth, *The Practicing Stoic*, 209)  

2. [**The Reserve Clause**](https://donaldrobertson.name/2013/02/02/action-with-a-reserve-clause-in-marcus-aurelius/) —> Engaging with the world of indifferents, we must act with detachment: We shall do our utmost to serve the common good, “Fate permitting.”
   1. To succeed or to fail does not make us virtuous. To act energetically in the name of good intentions is all we have the choice of doing. With a reserve clause, a life of pursuing and falling short of justice is still the noblest path.
   2. *“Try persuasion first, but even though men would say to you not to, act when the principles of justice direct you to. If anyone one should obstruct you by force, take refuge in being contented and without emotional pain, and use the obstacle for the display of some other virtue. Remember that the impulse you had was with an “reserve clause”, and your aim was not to do the impossible.”* (*Meditations*, 6.50)
   3. *“Though a man may in some sort hinder my activity, yet on my own voluntary impulses and mental attitude no fetters can be put because of the “reserve clause” and their ability to adapt to circumstances. For everything that stands in the way of its activity is adapted and transmuted by the mind into furtherance of it, and that which is a check on this action is converted into a help to it, and that which is a hindrance in our path goes but to make it easier.”* (*Meditations*, 5.20)  

3. [**Virtue in**](https://donaldrobertson.name/2018/05/15/the-stoic-socrates-four-emotional-resilience-strategies/) **& through Adversity** —> The world provides us with challenges so that we may test ourselves, become more virtuous and capable, and learn to find the value in all that may happen. We have virtues to face challenges; by facing challenges, we become virtuous. 
   1. We are to recognize and love the necessity of obstacles; appreciate our natural ability to confront and overcome it; seek the chance to prove and train ourselves, and find the humor and purpose granted by reversals.
   2. [Life as a “ball game”:](https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/stoicism-as-a-ball-game/) We seek to play with care and respect for other players, acknowledge their efforts to defeat us with calm, and exert ourselves fully with skill *and* neutrality towards the outcome.  A challenge to play well, not flip out. (1)
   3. *“Good men work, spend and are spent, and they do so willingly. Fortune does not drag them; they follow, and keep step.”* (Seneca, On Providence 5.4)
   4. *“This is no misfortune,; to bear it nobly, rather, is good fortune.”* (*Meditations* 4.49)
   5. “*And yet life, Lucilius, is really a battle. For this reason those who are tossed about at sea, who proceed uphill and downhill over toilsome crags and heights, who go on campaigns that bring the greatest danger, are heroes and front-rank fighters; but persons who live in rotten luxury and ease while others toil, are mere turtle-doves safe only because men despise them.”* (Seneca, *Moral Letters to Lucilius*, 96)  

4. [Stoic Joy](https://donaldrobertson.substack.com/p/three-sources-of-happiness-in-stoicism) —> It is in the activities of virtuous pursuit that we find cause to be joyful regarding our own virtue, the virtues of others, and joy in our lot in the world.
   1. We need not suppress our disappointments and frustrations, but rather recognize that they do not undermine the importance of virtuous action. With detachment and present-mindedness, they are easily endurable. 
   2. To the Stoic, virtue alone is sufficient for happiness under any circumstances. It is a rewarding experience to serve others, and enjoy exercising our ability to do so. We may find pleasure in acting out our natural function. 
   3. *“A man when he has done a good act, does not call out for others to come and see, but he goes on to another act, as a vine goes on to produce again the grapes in season.”* (Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations* 5.6)
   4. *""...Happiness is not supposed to be the Stoic goal, not even covertly. The Stoic view, rather, is that one should embrace virtue for its own sake, and that doing so is necessary to get the good side effects of it.""* (Ward Farnsworth, *The Practicing Stoic*, 209)  
 

Thanks for reading! Happy to discuss in the comments as usefully as I am able (fate permitting ;). 

Also, if you have any good articles on how challenges *develop* virtue, please share them and I'll add them to this post -- it seems like a major theme for [Seneca](https://www.stoicinsights.com/senecas-death-and-the-transformation-of-adversity/) and [Epictetus](https://academyofideas.com/2019/02/psychology-of-resilience/) to my mind, but most articles I found focused on philosophical coping mechanisms rather than Stoic virtue creation.

About substances such as caffeine and energy drinks.,"Caffeine is a substance that brings us physical benefits, such as mood and energy, which is especially useful for those who maintain a physical exercise routine.  However, it is addictive and if consumed in excess can cause death.  The same could be said with energy drinks, which have high doses of caffeine.

How do I stop expecting things from people/the world?,"I’m very much new to stoicism, I’ve started reading the important texts but I haven’t gotten very deep yet.

Also I’m aware that some people here are bothered by relationship drama stuff, but here I’m just using it as the most convenient and relevant example.

My partner of 5 years left me for someone else. I haven’t been the perfect partner for her, but I supported her through many trials, made sacrifices for the relationship, etc. Obviously given how she left me for someone else and wasn’t very kind or caring towards me through the break-up process. Regardless of how much I understand how it’s irrational to expect her to treat me more “fairly” and be more grateful for the things I did and sacrificed for her throughout our relationship, deep down I can’t help but do expect it from her and be upset that she did not. Of course this is just one example, as since getting more into stoicism I noticed how much I expect from people and the world and how much energy and words I waste being upset at things/people not turning out how I would want them to. I tell myself and the rational “part” of my brain understands that it’s foolish to wish for a fig in winter. But deeper inside my soul I still cry out for the fig. I’m not sure how stoics are able to rewire themselves to stop wishing for it. Are there exercises for this specifically?

Any help would be appreciated, thank you.",Stoicism,1702718739.0,t3_18jnmtf,0.91,9

Marcus Aurelius teaches to not complain; I kinda disagree.,"The quote goes ""Don't be overhead complaining... not even to yourself"" -Marcus Aurelius, 8.9.  

Complaining is all about emotional expression. when an emotion is dominating your mind it becomes easy to become hopeless, and feel like you cannot fix the problem. When you vent out this emotion (complaining is an easy way to do that), it allows your brain to operate clearly and it removes that burden from your mind. So id wager it's more beneficial to complain in moderation than to not most of the time. Also, from my experience it's a great ice breaker, an easy way to relate to other people, and often doesn't come off as annoying.

How Would a Stoic Deal With a Conservative Religious Family?,"Hi all, I'm a 21 Y.O. living in the UK.  


Roughly 3 years ago, I accepted to myself that I am no longer a Muslim, but rather an agnostic. I kept this hidden from my family, even when they knew that I had a lot of doubts and questions concerning Islam. They demand that I pray all 5 of my daily prayers with them, that I attend religious classes and that I cut ties with any non-religious friends that I may have.  


Fast-forward to today. I have a decent paying job, I have a tenancy agreement for an apartment that I can move into within the next month, and there's a lot of tension that's hard to avoid between my family and I. I believe that moving out will help in raising my self-esteem and my ability to be honest with my parents. They're worried that I'll condemn myself to hell if I don't work on increasing my knowledge when it comes to Islam, and that me considering moving out is a sign that I'm looking to part ways with my family. I've tried to ease their worries by telling them that I'd visit every weekend or so and that my main reason for moving out is to commute into work easier, but all I'm met with are tears, scoldings and guilt-tripping. 

Their actions are understandable. I've told them that I still share their faith, even if I have tons of doubts. They believe that the doubts will only go away once I've submitted myself to god and worked on gaining knowledge in Islam. But the truth is, I have no intention of exploring Islam. I don't want to live the double-life wherein I pretend to be someone I'm not around my family. I understand that telling my family that I'm no longer Muslim could lead to shunning and disownment , but I recognize that this is something I'll have to do. 

I'm feeling a lot of pressure from my siblings, which i find incredibly troubling to deal with. I'm not sure how I can deal with the accusations that I'm causing my parents a lot of suffering, and that It's within my best interests to work on fulfilling their criteria (spending more time with family, going to prayers more often, etc) before moving out. What I haven't told them is that the stress of having to put up a facade around them has lead to me isolating myself from the family. My siblings hold me responsible for my parent's sadness, and that I should forget about the tenancy agreement for the apartment and never bring it up with my parents again.

I'm unsure of what to do next. Part of me believes that I should notify my parents that I've signed the tenancy agreement, move out and then work on telling my family that I'm agnostic. Part of me sees that me bringing it up would only cause pain and more tension, so therefore I shouldn't tell them and I should work on moving out without them noticing.  


What would your stoic tips be for dealing with a situation like this? Would it be acceptable for me to lie about not signing the tenancy agreement to avoid conflict? 

*(TL;DR: Left Islam. Now living a double-life around family. Unsure if I should tell my family that I've decided to move out)*

How to practice?,"So it's all very well and good saying to myself.
I don't care what they think of me.

On Anger,"We all get angry, and stoics would argue that it's how we control that emotion is the important part. But I read this quote and it hit me as a connection I had never made before: ""Anger is an emotional response to an unfulfilled expectation."" I realized how true that was - that when I felt anger it was because something was not happening the way I felt it should.

However this then begged the question: ""So do we then not have any expectations, if we don't want to feel anger?"" Not very realistic, and nihilistic really, which I don't think is any real way to live, but! If you have 0 expectations for anyone or anything then you no longer deal with anger.

So then is it better to temper expectations AND control the emotion of anger?

But if the goal is to \*feel\* less anger; then simply controlling it, isn't really the answer either. I apologize for my rambling - I'm just trying to write down what has been rolling around in my head for the last little bit.

Any advice or insights that I'm missing?",Stoicism,1702654507.0,t3_18j2sb8,1.0,10
Having trouble reading Epictetus,"Hi,

I've read The Meditations (and loved it) so I wanted to see what Epictetus had to say as well. I got to about chapter 18 (or I18?) in book 1 and honestly I'm just confused at this point. 

I understand the Discourses are, well, discourses and not really a book written by Epictetus himself, but still I find his arguments being rather confusing and messy. Not very clear. 

For example: Chapter, 17, is titled ""concerning the necessity of logic"" (I got the penguin classics edition). Epictetus starts by presenting a problem/paradox - reason can only be analyzed either by itself or by something superior, however ""there is nothing superior to reason"" and reason cannot analyze itself because it creates an endless loop. Then he goes on to address a claim (hypothetical or from someone in the audience? i'm not sure) saying that regardless, emotions are more important than logic, only to show that it isn't the case and that no debate could be held with rules set by emotions.

So, he says, we use logic to define the terms in which we analyze things and discuss among ourselves (but how is that related to the paradox at the begging?). Then he goes on to argue against another claim against logic and then he ends up with talking about understanding nature, some victim of something unclear and then God and a philosopher's power of interpretation.

Of course it's much more complicated but I tried to keep it short XD

So as you can see, this is what I got from this chapter. Honestly I don't understand what he was trying to say and it's the same in most of the other chapters. He seems a bit all-over-the-place for me.

I wanted to know if other readers faced the same problem or is it just me? Is he getting clearer in following chapters? Maybe you could give me tips on how to read Epictetus, maybe I'm missing something?

Thanks!",Stoicism,1702629634.0,t3_18ivnaq,0.6,1
Stoicism as an ever evolving philosophy,"In my mind, stoicism must evolve and change with the times to remain relevant. Marcus Aurelius, one of the most quoted and beloved stoic thinkers would most likely not fit the mold of how we think of stoics today. Despite being a man that pursued virtue as the highest importance he owned slaves. Would owning a slave today fit our judgment of what it means to be Just, one of the touchstones of stoic philosophy? I certainly hope not! People are a product of their time and their experiences. Times change and our notion of what it means to be just, temperate, wise and courageous must change with them.",Stoicism,1702626242.0,t3_18iuv7w,0.8,9
Stoic advice for the probable loss of a pet?,"I've been reading about stoicism for about a year now and its had a huge impact on my mental health, however recently my ability to put it to use has been tested to say the least. 

This may seem trivial compared to other peoples problems, but I have a young cat (soon to be five y/o) who I may lose in the near future. He has a condition he has to be medicated for and this medication has a long list of probable side effects, the biggest one being another illness where I have decided that I would rather put him down than make him go through that treatment.

This is not a 100% certanity, but it is indeed a very probable risk and I cannot stop worrying, waiting and bracing myself for the heartache of having to decide to let him go. I have had more time than many others have gotten and I try to be thankful for this and to appreciate each day instead of thinking about the next, but this is constantly on my mind and I feel so sad and anxious about it. Any advice would be much appreciated.

Tl;dr: There is a big risk I might have to put my cat down in the near future, seeking advice on how not to waste the remaining time worrying.",Stoicism,1702618544.0,t3_18iswm0,0.76,6
How stoics deals with racism?,"I come from oppressed community in India, we're still treated like trash in my country. I want to do good things for the people not just for mine but for everyone. But the criticism and everything stops me and makes me anxious.

Although I haven't experienced discrimination directly. But I read it online about growing violence against our community. I have experienced it indirectly a lot. I tried to be best for my whole life and I succeeded in that too, I topped my school and college. People say that I am mediocre Dalit and that whatever I get is because of reservations (which is a special law for giving equal opportunity for oppressed communities, by allowing equal representation of people in education and other areas, like affirmative action). Think of Jews living in ghettos during ww2 Germany (I don't mean to offend anyone nor I am associating with worst tragedy in history, it's just the growing violence scares me and I can resonate with that event). Because of this and reading about violence, I hardly talk to anyone because I am scared to be out in public. I stopped going out for dates and asking out many years ago, cuz I am afraid that it will end badly and no one wants to get married and associated with a ""Dalit"". I am too scared of achieving my goals because everything in India is based on casteism, I may not find a house on rent because my caste. It's just bad here.

I used to lie in school about my caste.

Even though it happened it hasn't turned me into a bitter person. I respect every individual and empathize with others. I control my anger nor do I argue with someone who calls me names or makes fun of my community and call us scums. It's just that I am scared to do anything. Because if I achieve something in life I will be known as ""Dalit boy who... achieved something"" not a ""College boy who... achieved something"" or ""Engineering student who... achieved something""

If I have to do something I have to stay in limits because that may exploit my caste and people will bash my family for this reason.

Seeing things just as they are,"Hello everybody. 
Lately I've been advancing in my studies of Stoicism and I've come to a realization, more of the development of a skill actually. Lately I have been able to see things the way they are. What do I mean by this?

Someone says an insult. Is it good? Bad? It was just an insult, or more radically, just words that were cataloged negatively by us.

Someone outplayed you? They just did a certain action. Now it is up to you to cataloge it in a way.
 
Do you feel frustration? It was just a feeling that makes you stay alert and feel weird things, not necessarily bad. 

After meditating on this new skill that I have been developing, I was very confused how should I use it in a way that is constructive, for the Virtue, for the community and for my path. Now I realize that insults are starting to lose meaning for me, therefore they start to mean less and less, it's just words, and now I feel some kind of power, like ""I can do whatever I want with that insult"". Destructive behaviors, the same. I have been gradually overcoming that confusion through Stoic ethics, at least the few I've studied about it. I decide to use this for what I judge to be good, the justice, for the community, for my learning and development path. It is interesting. Have any of you experienced this before? Tell me your story and your Meditations on this.",Stoicism,1702614546.0,t3_18irrg1,0.89,7
Antipater,"I see a lot of people seeking advice so I thought I would switch things up with some food for thought. Stoicism seems to be perceived as an all or nothing philosophy that encourages us to not feel and discourages us when we fall short. This doesn’t have to be the case. Antipater, the 6th leader of the stoic school formed by Zeno, took the philosophy in another direction than his predecessors by loosening some of the absolutist rules that had been laid before him. Early stoics held that all sins were wrong and equal. Antipater rejected this notion recognizing that stealing a loaf of bread is not the same as murdering the baker for the bread. In Lives of the Stoics, by Stephen Hanselman and Ryan Holiday, they compare the modern stoic to an archer. “We train and practice. We draw back the arrow and aim it to the best of our abilities. But we know full well that despite our training and our aim, many factors outside our control will influence where the arrow hits the target-or if it falls short entirely. We take action. But much happens after that-much of it is not remotely up to us. Which is why we know that our true worth does not reside in whether or not we get a bullseye.”  I thought that was a fitting analogy.

Should I be always trying to think if I did the most virtue thing that I could?,"I was thinking about that: Should I be, after all actions, thinking about them and questioning myself if it was the best action i could take or should I simply focus on trying to take the best action and later on on the day, maybe evening, I stop and think about that while journaling or meditating, and focusing the judgment of my action on this period of the day? That came to my mind because a lot of times I end up being caught on my own thoughts in the mid of the day trying to judge some action of mine and this leads to more untoughtful actions.

Being ok with saying goodbye,"My parents are seperated but they’re both alcoholics. My dad is worse, he lost his great career like 8 years ago, lost a few jobs after that, been to detox over 5 times in the past 5 years but he keeps going back to drinking. 

I moved from one place back to my hometown to help him and hopefully get him clean, at this point I’m over it. He’s getting kicked out of his place soon and I’m heading back across the country to finally focus on my own life. I always felt like I have to go out of my way to parent my parents but I’ve delayed my own career and life for them. 

When I move I don’t plan to come back, unless to visit. Leaving means, like everyday, he (or anybody in the world) may pass.

If they were terrible parents I could leave easier and never look back.

"If emotions seem to be a natural result of the body, why are we trying to control them so much?","There's a concept in stoicism that we should control that which we can, and accept those things which we cannot.  But can we really control the fact we feel emotions?  I've never met anyone who doesn't experience them, and personally they feel very instant and inevitable.  It seems like to me, I have an inevitable emotion, and then a controllable, separate, external reaction to it.

To me, once I'm already feeling an emotion, it makes it much worse to try and suppress it.  So I kind of just give myself permission to feel whatever naturally comes.  Letting myself be okay with not being okay is deeply liberating and has really been centering to me emotionally, but it seems this isn't the majority consensus on the stoic treatment of emotions, and me admitting to others I'm feeling certain emotions isn't stoic at all.  But when I do this, I feel much more calm and controlled, and the emotions I do have are smaller on the outside.

So I wanted to ask if there's an appropriately stoic way to see this.  I've been reading Epictetus and so far nothing in the enchiridion goes against what I'm saying.  But it seems this is not the common interpretation of the content, and that most have a concept of a stoic being a sort of iceman/woman

My mind goes nuts over a choice that I didn't have,"I want to embrace stoicism, but my mind keeps pointing me back to my ""old"" ways. 

This is the weirdest most recent example: 
I recently started a new job. Part of that was getting a company car. Normally you'd order one from the 3 choices the company has for you, these are mainly the cheapest versions of cars. With the push to ev's however this means I can only choose electric cars. We already have one ev at home and like an ice car as backup, so my only option is getting one from the company pool. 

I had two choices: a few months old ford focus or a 3 years old Opel Astra. I obviously went for the Ford, added bonus is that when i do have to pick an EV i can pick a more matured one. 

Now I have a colleague who was fortunate and could choose one of the last Ice cars. He went for the new Opel Astra. Turns out that basic Astra is way more luxurious than my Ford albeit a bit more expensive. 

My mind now constantly goes into ""what if"" mode. Because of course, my mind believes the new Opel is the better choice. I believe this goes back to my constant persuit of perfection. If i have choices, no matter what they are about, u always try to go for the best and very best one. 

Tl;dr:
My mind is contemplating over a choice I didn't even have. Stoicism tells me that all I have control over is my own judgement, yet my mind can't stop overthinking this. What to do? 

And yes, I know this is a first world problem. I'm happy with the car and very fortunate, but I also want to make clear that I do pay for it.",Stoicism,1702547760.0,t3_18i59ss,0.6,3
"""There is nothing fearful in nature for the rational man""","I've come across this quote in a lecture about Marcus Aurelius ( Michael Sugrue). Quotes like this and others

""He who fears death will never do anything worth of a man who is alive"" - Seneca.

underscore  the paralyzing effect of fear. I often find myself hesitating to do stuff held back by the uncertainty and anxiety surrounding the unknown, so by fear. Most of these fears are irrational. Quotes like this remind that life is meant to be lived and always avoiding things u fear kills u in a metaphorical sense. And if worse comes to worst injury, death or other losses are all just part of nature and therefore not anything to be afraid of.

A stoic perspective on the irreplaceable,"My Dad passed away suddenly this year. First and foremost he was an amazing father with a deep sense of duty and community. He was a well respected Jungian psychologist both in his practice and as a professor. He was a role model in the relationship he shared with my mom and a man that practiced what he preached. He has been the most influential person in my life.

I’m posting this in hope that someone else may find value in my reflections on how stoicism influenced my thoughts around his passing. 

————

When we accept that we have been deprived of something we once had, our next logical instinct is to choose one of the following courses of action: find it, replace it, or do without it.

When something irreplaceable is taken, we cannot find it again because it exists nowhere else. We cannot replace it, as that is the definition of irreplaceable. Then, we are seemingly left with only one option: to do without. What may seem as the lesser of three outcomes is the most beautiful. 

When we accept the nature of what was given back as irreplaceable we can only choose to do without. Once that choice is made we can be at peace with what was given back. We no longer struggle to find what we had again or recreate it. Accepting that we will never have what we had ever again is not a lamentation, it is a testament to how beautiful and special it was. 

We must see ourselves as artists and what is gone as our work of art. We may enjoy creating the work, admire its shape as it takes form, and even the struggle to make it beautiful. The complete and refined beauty of our work can only be seen after we are finished with it. Our appreciation for what we created is deepened when we know every step that formed it.

We shouldn’t look back at what we had and wish we still had it. We now have the privilege to look back on it as completed. We get to admire how beautiful our journey with it was from start to finish. Our focus is on how grateful we are that fate allowed us to have something so precious at all, regardless of duration. 

It’s the rarest joy to give back something that cannot be replaced.

"A short review, and a question, regarding unearned wisdom in the modern era. Would love to hear your thoughts.","UNEARNED WISDOM IN THE MODERN ERA

Growing up and living in the modern era provides a unique experience, compared to our ancestors’, in respect to the accessibility of information. In a world where we are more interconnected than ever before, we are blessed to have instant and untethered access to knowledge and information in mere seconds, through use of the internet.

Lessons that once took a near lifetime to learn can be easily accessed by keyboard. Endless archives of wisdom, built upon through the ages, as a result of hard work and discipline, hand us the opportunity to learn and grow on a silver platter.

Herein the problem lies, many of us are constantly looking outwards for answers, or worse yet, outsourcing a sense of purpose and growth, subcontracting the hard work and toil required to gain such wisdom, and condensing said effort into mere seconds, leaving us overstimulated, desensitised, and none-the-wiser.

Knowledge, without practical application, is almost useless. That is, unless your goal is to *sound* like someone who has their life together. But actions speak louder than words, and eventually these pseudo-sages will demonstrate their lack of self control.

So, then the question remains, how do you pick the low-hanging fruit of the modern day world, and turn it into actual, practical wisdom?

Wisdom can be defined as *‘the quality of having experience, knowledge and good judgement’.*

In order to reach good judgement, we must first possess the knowledge, which can be unlocked through the experience.

Here is a step-by-step process for effectively gaining accurate wisdom through experience:

**Step One**

A certain event will happen, which has a significant outcome, either expected or not. The more intensely positive, or negative, the experience is, the more valuable information there may be to learn, and the higher levels of emotion that may be produced as a by-product.

**Step Two**

Reflection on the experience, if possible including the ability to compare it to others, the vision to explore other possible outcomes, creating knowledge. Reflection must come from an emotionally stable perspective, otherwise it can distort the lesson which remains to be learned.

For example, a start-up business which fails, losing a lot of money, will be a highly emotional event, but inside will be a treasure trove of knowledge and experience, which could undoubtedly help in the future.

Concerning pearls of wisdom, it should be known, that in order to claim the precious gemstone from the tightly clasped oyster, your fingers will get sore and bloodied in the process.

If the event is reviewed from an emotionally driven perspective, the person involved may say: “I knew my colleagues were right, I am not cut out to be a businessman, I should have just stayed in my previous job.”

But this does not give much, if any, useful feedback. It just provides an emotional reasoning as to why the event unfolded this way, rather than a logical situational report which can better guide us in the future.

And this kind of emotional response is not only negatively-based, for example if the same new business was instantly a huge success, perhaps the emotionally driven reflection would be: “I am so great at opening businesses. I must have the golden touch!” – creating a false sense of genius in oneself, leading to overreaching and under-preparing later on.

In order to be successful and accurate in your reflection of events, you must be emotionally removed. This can take time, to detach yourself from the immediacy of the situation, but necessary in order to have an impartial perspective.

**Step Three**

The ability to judge new situations, and modify choices or behaviour based on the knowledge gained from previous experience, thus defining wisdom.

In order to be able to draw on such knowledge, like in the previous step, you must begin with an emotionally stable frame-of-mind. With a higher risk or reward relying on the outcome of the event in question, the situation will become more emotionally charged, making emotional detachment more difficult, creating a reaction, rather than an action.

With this step-by-step of earning wisdom through experience, the question stands. Not all those who are experienced are wise, but is it possible to become wise without experience? How do you absorb the wisdom of lessons which you haven’t lived yourself?",Stoicism,1702468375.0,t3_18hf56u,0.57,1

Ancient stoics and suicide,"So I read letter 12 from seneca and it felt like he was talking about suicide and I researched about it seems multiple stoics from Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius and seneca , cato all talks about suicide

Considering marcus had a huge nation to rule? 
Epictetus was a slave with severe punishment? 
Seneca being a general when nero was young it was said seneca was handling political affairs? 

So all these are too huge of a roles and must have lot of obstacles

What stopped them from suicide?(not saying later event with seneca)

"Social media toxicity, R/vegan, and what should I do.","So I am recently new to Reddit, again. I was on reddit back in  2012 to 2014, but stopped until this year. I like how Reddit is mostly more positive, especially compared to the toxicity of Facebook. 
I have found great communities from books, dogs, satellite radio fans, to philosophy.
But something recently left a bad taste in my mouth. I am vegetarian and try mostly for a vegan diet due to my morality with animals. Not preaching this is just my personal beliefs, but I feel this is important information for the story.
So anyways I also joined R/vegan.
I posted a few times on the subreddit and recently I posted an article entitled ""Veganism is in crisis, and the fanatics can only blame themselves"" and asked what the people what they thought of the criticism. Just because I was curious. I did not write the article.
But I would say about 40% to 45% started to attack me personally or my online persona I guess.
I like to think I have tuff skin and shit posters and trolls don't bother me, but this time it kind of did.
I was just asking what people thoughts were and to start a discussion. I didn't give my opinion of the article and I have been posting on the board for awhile. 
But almost half of them seemed mad at me, I tried to defend myself, but they didn't seem to care. After a few responses I realized I was just wasting my time and deleted my post and blocked a few people. 
I had my wife look at the post and she says it did not look offensive or anything like that, but I do admit she could be biased.
I was really starting to like Reddit with the discussions. But R/vegan makes me question if I should give up social media in general. I don't know. 
I like the discussions, but I am getting to old to deal with shit posters all the time. I am not sure if this was a one time fluke, a vegan thing (I am not unrealistic, I know how they can be sometimes), a reddit thing, or just people...

How much mental energy or thought process does practicing Stoicism take up?,"BTW: I wasn't sure if I should be putting this in the ""New to Stoicism"" or in ""Seeking Stoic Advice"" - I've only been interested in Stoicism as a means for dealing with my own circumstances for the past year or so.

For some context: I struggle with the actual practicing of Stoicism, mostly due to having ADHD (mostly the Inattentive type).  Despite trying to work on it, I can often find the impulsive nature of my mind engages way too quickly.  If I'm in a 'hyperfocused' state regarding Stoicism, I can manage that a little better - but the effort it seems to take mentally is exhausting.

So:

I don't think I've seen this discussed - but how much time and effort is spent mentally going over the practice of being Stoic?  I am aware in CBT there are often things like half-hour daily exercises, but these are really more transformative things that are designed to work over longer periods.  To me, Stoicism is more a 'way of life' kind of philosophy and thinking - reacting to and interpreting situations and circumstances constantly.

That constant examination and practice seems exhausting to me.  I'm the kind of person who can become mentally exhausted after doing a client meeting, or having a slightly busier day, or just one of those days where my brain decides to inner monologue about anything and everything constantly.  Add to that all the little rules I have to follow otherwise I'll lose things, forget things and generally mess my day up horribly.  I often have to force myself to mono-task and try to keep focus even doing a simple thing like making a cup of tea or a sandwich.

This is all compounded by my seeing this quote of Epictetus: ""Don't explain your philosophy.  Embody it."" when I've been searching for some kind of guidance.  To me, to embody something is to take it on completely, utterly - it becomes ***everything***.

I guess alternatively - what is a good balance of applying Stoic principles in your mind over just letting things flow naturally to see how well the practices are taking hold? 

(In my life, and mind, if I'm not actively thinking about a process, then that process can very much not exist at all.  So coming into a situation where I *could* practice a Stoic principle, I'll forget that I can and instead do something else, and on reflection, something worse.)

I hope this makes sense, it's really hard for me to put down into words exactly what I'm trying to get across (and I'm sure I've probably missed some obvious point I should have made lol).",Stoicism,1702425079.0,t3_18h1dcc,0.75,6

How do you practice not trying to get stressed out about things out of your control? Is that missing the point?,"I have a bumpy relationship with my mother. She frequently burns bridges with people and is generally negative and depressing to be around. She burned a bridge with my fiance last year, and generally has a bad relationship with my sister. This xmas we will all be spending it in separate locations (which is fine with me given the situation) but my mom is being super negative about it because she believes the 24th is ""her"" time to have us at her house. Long story short, shes tough to be around and pushes people away but still wants us to spend time with her.

I called her today to invite her to our house for xmas, since my sister would be away and I know my mom has no one else to spend xmas with (other than her husband and his family).

The concept of virtue is circular,"Stoics advocate for following virtue, but what how might one define what is virtuous? A stoic would respond: ""that which results in your contentment/ what is in your nature.""   


The skeptic would rightly reply, ""what makes you content?""   


The Stoic would reply: ""That which uses the right reason""  


And on and on the circular reasoning goes. Without defining what contentment is or what the right reason is, this is a never ending circle and doesn't mean anything.   


Another counterargument: that which is just, wise, moderate and courageous is what makes you content.   


The skeptic would reply ""Why are those things virtues and not something else?"" And there is no answer.   


Finally, a Stoic might say something like: ""That which is good for you is the right use of reason""  


The skeptic would reply: ""But you just said that the only thing good for me is the right use of reason. If the only thing that is good is reason, then why is what is good for you the right use of reason? In other words, doing what is good is the right use of judgement, but you haven't actually defined what is good. Without defining what is good, then what makes it a good judgement?""

I am reading through Meditations for the first time and early on he mentions that one thing he learned from his adopted father was not to be too self indulgent and he admired that he had, “no concern for food, or the cut and color of his clothes, or having attractive slaves.”

My understanding is that stoicism teaches us how to better handle adversity and how to carry yourself in a way that others can respect. I don’t understand why caring about how you present yourself would negatively impact the Stoic.

Stoicism for giving birth,"
I'm going to be giving birth in a few weeks. What advice does Stoic philosophy have for me? Has anyone on here faced this experience and found Stoic perspectives helpful?

I plan to use pain medication in combination with other coping techniques - I find it most helpful personally to think of childbirth as lying along the spectrum of human experience that we can bring the resources of humanity (modern medicine!) to bear against, rather than a primal/natural event that my body will handle in a way separate from other parts of my life. (Dying is also part of the human experience, and people with a choice in the matter rarely form a goal of ""getting through it without unnatural interventions."") But I also understand that people feel many ways about this topic, and have a great admiration for people who pursue an unmedicated delivery - please don't make this post into a war about which of these approaches is ""more Stoic.""

Even though I expect to get an epidural, the education and medical advice I've gotten are consistent in recommending to delay epidurals until fairly late in the game (or at least it seems late to me) to avoid slowing labor. Epidurals can also fail or turn out to be unavailable for a variety of reasons. So I know I'm in for ??? hours of steadily increasing discomfort and pain, in an altered mental and hormonal state I haven't experienced before.  I also have never had my pain tolerance tested to an extreme degree, and know that pain tolerance and the experience of what labor feels like varies hugely. 

I vacilate between using voluntary discomfort as opportunities to practice not-suffering, and trying not to borrow worry/suffering from the future by going too nuts with it. I hold a lot of ice cubes and long yoga poses, and have access to good resources for specific mental management techniques for handling contractions.

Stoic perspectives have been very helpful to me during pregnancy, both for pregnancy symptoms (treatable and untreatable) and for thinking about upcoming labor.  There is a lot I can't control both about things that are inevitable (pain) and things that are unknowable (what complications arise, if I have back labor or require other medical interventions, if my epidural fails) - and it's very freeing to realize this means that me ruminating about it won't change anything.

Does stoic philosophy provide a justification for the holocaust?,"Good day all, I have this question that I have not been able to google and am keen to hear your opinions. That is, how would a stoic look at the holocaust? Epictetus says ""Things that are not within our own power, not without our Will, can by no means be either good or evil"". So if you were someone within the concentration camp, would you say that the holocaust was neither good nor evil and embrace it? 

He also says ""until you know their reasons, how do you know they’ve acted wrongly"". And the same applies here, if you do not know why a nazi did what he did, how do we say it was wrong? Just because he had orders to kill someone, does not mean there were not anterior motives, motives we are not aware of. 

Please let me know what you think. This community is well more versed in stoic philosophy than I.

Ps. I am of course not trying to justify the holocaust. I am very intrigued by the application of stoic philosophy in the most, to our standards, dire and horrific of scenarios. ",Stoicism,1702379851.0,t3_18gjnav,0.24,0
Halfway in One Journey,"I am living alone for the first time. I have been unwell with RSV in early October. I got braces put on in July of 2020 and neglected them completely. I have a manager who is nasty, selfish and sociopathic. 

Despite all that, I am working 40 hour weeks while pursuing a bachelor's degree full time. Most Bachelors in my field take three-four years to complete, and I am on track to complete it in just over two. I went through and put myself through getting the dental surgery I needed to, to get my orthodontics back on track, including the extraction of wisdom teeth. 

I am taking the steps I want to take on the road to who I want to be.

The narrow road, the focus on actions and the self, are all helping shape me into a better person. I am giving up my anxiety and desire for control over my environment and learning more and more to focus on myself. Compared to where I was this time last year, I have forged a far better path for myself and my future is more and more certain. 

Despite the odds, Stoicism has helped keep me focus, step back from myself, and prevent me from circling the drain when things have gotten hard. I am forging my future with my own hands and taking responsibility for who and what I will become.

"Is age regression as a man with ADD, GAD and infantile autism a problem?","Hey i have a lot og diagnostics, these 3. I combatted a lot of these with talking 5 min cold showers daily everyday in morning, I also try to run 3 kilometres everyday. I try to go to bed at 11 pm and wake up at 7 am. I drink coffee daily before 12 am, I also take ADD medication and anxiety medication. I write gratitude journal daily, as well as notes and I try to build on myself by doing various activities. Like reading, going to Gym, breathing exercises and more.

I still have addictions, I feel hyper sexual so i masturbait daily. I play computer a lot and I work as much as possible. I love working but my job, isn’t something that I can do daily. Because it’s sort of like a company that finds jobs for me where I can work, and if they need me I’ll be there.

But I also find that I tend to get more addicted to things, I constantly have tendencies of seeing myself as a man child even though I have been told I’m very mature. I seek attention, and I have over reactions and I worry a lot.

I feel like I can’t get out of this rut that I am in, I finished gymnasium. But idk, I feel like I’m inadequate and that I cannot be a man. Like all of my actions have been for nothing, I overcame depression and I finished gymnasium despite having undiagnosed ADHD, anxiety, depression and infantile autism.

Yet I feel like I never accomplished anything, I know I’m not nothing and I know that I’m valuable. But I constantly feel like I have no value, like no one think I’m anything but a mistake. I feel like I can’t be a man, almost like I never had a chance. I know I can do anything and that I can’t stay resilient through pain and suffering, stay composed and be a leader.

How do you cope with other's opinions,"I recently took to stoicism and it's principles. This was since February 2023. I have been working on myself physically, mentally and emotionally. Howover, recently I had the pleasure of meeting my friends of old. There was this one particular person that I had a falling out with. I have made amends to that relationship as best as possible later. But this particular person seems to enjoy picking me apart. I care for this person and I cryptically suggested that they reflect on their feelings and find out if they were going wrong in some way. Then they proceeded to rip me apart while poking on my insecurities. I have come to grips with that after some time. But they mentioned that I have this way of thinking wherein I feel that I am superior to everyone around me. Is sharing an opinion that you have wrong? And what do you do when someone you care about is doing wrong? Lastly, how do you remove yourself from caring about other's opinions of you? Please share your views.

Is this stoicism or something else? Vanity?,"Life is suffering. To engage in life's pleasures is to cause more greater suffering later in life. To the contrary, to allow yourself to suffer and deal with the suffering of life in the present, softens the suffering later in life.

Example. People go on vacation and blow thousands of dollars instead of working or investing that money. They buy temporary happiness, but end up slaving for money for more of their life. To the contrary, someone who does not partake in these types of temporary happiness, save money and invest and can become financially free and reduce their suffering later in life by embracing the hard work and discipline it takes to focus on what is important; in this case that is financial freedom.

Does anyone else struggle with feelings of sanctimony and an inflated ego with stoicism?,"Stoicism has helped my life massively, and because  of that I feel like it’s starting to inflate my ego. Anytime I find myself stroking my own ego, I try to bring myself back to reality.

I find arrogant/know it all people to be so incredibly cringe and obtuse, but I can’t help but start to feel that way about myself. Stoicism has changed my life in such a dramatic way, that I can’t help but feel like I know a secret to life that everyone else is ignorant to…and my ego insists on telling me I must be such a special snowflake for possessing the knowledge few others have. I find myself impulsively preaching to others about stoicism and I feel gross after the fact(I will gladly talk about it to those who like to talk philosophy, but others don’t care).


The rational part of me knows I’m not special, or better than anyone else…and I’d really like to develop a sense of natural humility to bring myself back to ground level.

Stoicism - Reading the news or not?,"I've been involved with stoicism for about a year now. Reading books, listening to podcasts, watching videos etc. I feel like I have successfully applied rules and values to my life. I am definitely less angry, my short temper is gone, I'm able to smile more, I accept things for who or what they are, I generally feel better etc.

Recently, I had had a discussion with a friend of mine. He isn't as involved in stoicism, but he knows what it is and it's core values.

He asked me about an event that happened in the world, and I told him I wasn't aware of it, because I don't read the news. He asked why, and I told him that the news make me angry, thus I avoid it. Although, I still read news I find interesting that doesn't upset me, like technology and some entertainment news.

He told me that he can read the news and not get angry, and stay neutral regardless of what he's reading. That's definitely not me. The news themselves, and how the media stirs the pot and presents the news, it's a breeding ground for anger. So I avoid it, and in return I'm happier, with the blowback of not staying as informed about the world (which can be a blessing and a curse).

My friend told me that a TRUE stoic, would be able to read any news and stay neutral, and me avoiding the news isn't what a stoic person should do. A stoic person should block out external things while staying informed. He argued that I should train myself to read the news, whatever it is, and stay neutral.

This intrigued me. It felt like a superpower. But me training myself by reading negative news, and forcing myself to stay neutral, sounds awful. I mean, how long would that take?

But first let's get the definition down here. Local news headline: 8-year-old girl sexually assaulted by 3 men. Alright… Do I smash things around me? No. But I carry this news with me in the back of my head, and it's there, making me angrier than I should have been if I didn't read it. It can affect my entire day.

I don't see how a person could read that and stay neutral? In fact, that out right sounds like a psychopath.

What do you think?

EDIT: So many incredible comments. I wasn't expecting to get so dwelled down into stoic theory. This was great. 

Based on a lot of your comments as well as stoic theory, I'm guessing my friend is correct. However, flooding myself with negatiity just to stay informed about world events; isn't something I see as something good. 

Also important to mention is the fact that one news article doesn't upset me, or make me angry, despite the original post making it look like that. I'm talking about watching and reading general media news on a daily basis, and over months or years building a negative mindset. I can read a bad piece of news and brush it off. Should have made that more clear from the start.

I've been heavily informed, and I have been heavily uninformed (current state), and based on my mood and life in general, I prefer to be uninformed. Not MISINFORMED, but UNINFORMED. Reading up in current local news is a good thing. Reading up what happens on the other side of the world does no longer interest me.

What would the stoics have thought about eating animals in modern day?,"After reading meditations, it's clear that Marcus Aurelius was focused on living within his own nature as a human being, and valued the humans ability to reason above everything.

On one hand, eating meat is human nature, we are clearly omnivores and have eaten meat as a species for as long as we've been around. 
However in modern day, eating meat isn't a requirement to live a healthy life, and the mass production of meat is widely thought to be inefficient and cruel, so using reason and the information we have available, eating meat wouldn't be the virtuous choice.

I've just been thinking about this lately, and thought there was a bit of a clash between our nature and our ability to reason in this area. There's probably more stuff like this as the modern world is so different to what was going on back when Marcus was knocking about.",Stoicism,1702292647.0,t3_18fs32u,0.54,7
Stoicism doesn’t account for the unvirtuous motivations of beneficial behavior,"Many criticisms of stoicism are based upon faulty logic or misunderstandings, but one criticism that has always stuck with me is stoicism seems to underestimate is the heavy influence of unvirtuous motivations to drive positive behaviour.

Stoicism emphasizes the importance of a proper perspective, and valuing virtue above all else. Typically it is seen as unvirtuous to allow your emotions to control you, to allow yourself to stress unnecessarily, or to pursue things like sex, status or ego. 

However, modern psychology indicates these are humanities strongest motivators.  Thus, the closer to a sage you become, the more you eliminate these motivators, and the less productive of a citizen you will become, which ends up defeating a large part of being stoic in the first place. 

You can argue: “To stoics the only thing that matters is you are virtuous.” Would it be virtuous to decline a method which allow you can help fellow man more? Is it not selfish to reject the ability to care more because it harms you more?",Stoicism,1702278563.0,t3_18fos0s,0.36,0
Question about one’s own nature,"Hello,

I was contemplating about the fact that people can have their own ""natures"". For instance, I find that my nature is to provide for a family by having a job and loving/providing for them. Because of that, I studied and got a job to make that happen. 

I find my nature to be virtuous because I’m also serving society and whatnot, but then I thought I probably am biased in my line of thinking. 

I thought of a scenario where a person thinks that not working and not serving society is what nature demands of them due to any hypothetical reason (maybe they think society has failed them and that the right thing to do is to act against it). In that case, doing the opposite of what I thought was virtuous would become the virtuous thing to do for this person.

Is my thought on the right track? Or are there established guidelines for one’s nature to be virtuous? I thought of this after reminding myself of how Diogenes was praised by some stoic philosophers in some aspects (like in the famous banquet analogy).",Stoicism,1702266825.0,t3_18flmnz,0.86,5
What are some modern stoic texts you can recommend?,"When I was in 7th grade I read “The seven habits of highly effective people.” I didn’t know it at the time, but that was my first exposure to many of the stoic principles. A couple years later I read “Man’s search for meaning” and that book deeply moved me and taught me so much about the core of stoicism. In 11th grade I read “The Tao of Pooh” and used that book as a my personal spiritual guidebook until I discovered stoicism. When I was introduced to stoicism by the book “a guide to the good life” I felt like I had found a way of living that brought together the fundamental principles that had inspired and spoken to me throughout my life. I still consider myself very new to stoicism as it has only been a year and half since I started seriously studying it. Even so, one of my favorite things to do is to look for parallels in the works of the ancient stoics and that of other books I read, especially fiction.

"Self sufficiency over virtue, initially","I've been revisiting a piece in the Discourses http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0236%3Atext%3Ddisc%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D9,  and I know that ""self sufficiency is the greatest of all wealth"" is Epicurean(I think), and wealth is an indifferent in Stoicism?, but..

""..But a man may say, Whence shall I get bread to eat when I have nothing?""...""Wretch, if you have it, you will have it; if you have it not, you will depart from life...""

Somewhere in that section Epictetus calls some animals irrational and cowardly and then regards them at the same time for being self sufficient and living according to nature. I've heard that the success rate of a hunt for lions in our African wilderness is about 25% and many of them die from starvation. But when they succeed, they roar without reply and ravage without resistance.  I've also heard that tigers are pretty unremorseful. 

""...But we think about ourselves, as if we were only stomachs, and intestines, and shameful parts; we fear, we desire; we flatter those who are able to help us in these matters, and we fear them also...""

""..And shall it be necessary for one among us who is a philosopher to travel into foreign parts, and trust to and rely on others, and not to take care of himself, and shall he be inferior to irrational animals...""

It's coming off alittle like ""do it yourself, do what you have to do to survive..or atleast do what your nature requires in that given context because even actions which appear to be—and indeed are—immoral or unjust advance the overall design, which taken as a whole is harmonious and

One major change and some minor changes to the subreddit,"Howdy, we have decided on the small handful of changes described below.

\- **The New Agora**  
In order to better ensure that users seeking Stoic advice receive well-informed, specifically Stoic responses, we have decided to make a major change in the subreddit. Posts with the ""Seeking Stoic Advice"" flair will now be considered as seeking specifically and recognizably Stoic advice. Users who are seeking and offering personal opinions inspired by Stoicism, sharing experiences that may be influenced by Stoicism, or requesting and attempting to administer ""[first aid](https://modernstoicism.com/two-types-of-stoic-therapy-by-john-sellars/)"" will be welcome to do so in the New Agora, a daily pinned thread for these and other types of exchanges (including, for example, casual questions users don't want create posts for and extremely limited self-promotion). The New Agora is not an anything-goes thread; instead, it is for things that may be more tangentially, rather than directly, Stoic. Activity that is way off-base remains unwelcome.  
If your ""Seeking Stoic Advice"" post is removed because you are seeking personal opinions or asking what-would-you-do questions, you may instead post in the New Agora. 

\- **User flairs**  
In the interest of improving communication, we have decided to implement user flairs. In order to receive a user flair, message the moderators with your request. Pending our consensus, informed by our review of your activity, our background knowledge, and/or other factors, we will assign the flair and it will appear beside your username when you are active here. You may apply for flairs in accordance with the most suitable descriptors of your experience or interest. For example, flairs may include ""qualified/trustworthy user,"" ""academic/scholar,"" or ""προκόπτων."" The moderators may also decide to grant flairs to users on their own, without applications in mod messages, pending the user's agreement.

\- **Post flairs**  
As mentioned, the ""Seeking Stoic Advice"" flair is now strictly for seeking well-informed advice strictly drawing from and clearly aligned with Stoic philosophy.The ""Stoic Theory/Study"" flair will now only be assigned by moderators. If you would like to use this flair on your post, use the ""Pending Theory/Study"" flair. This will flag our attention, and we will review your post to determine whether to assign the ""Stoic Theory/Study"" flair. This is intended to prevent the misuse of the flair that is primarily meant for longform, well-informed, and careful posts, rather than pop-philosophy-type content, short personal observations, and newcomer questions.

Things may change, but we are going to move forward and monitor how well things work. If you have any questions, concerns, or other feedback, feel free to let us know.

"Seneca, Nero, and Christianity","This may be a little off the beaten track of this subreddit, but I'm curious about the... complex relationship between the three. I see this as relevant to this sub as it's related to how stoic ideas have influenced other schools of thought.

Nero was well known for his persecution of Christians, with some pointing at him being viewed as the literal Antichrist.
Seneca was highly influential to many Christians scholars to the point someone most likely forged correspondence (an early example of fanfiction) between him and Paul the Apostle.
We all know how Seneca is seen as a moderating influence on Nero.

Has anyone come across articles/essays that explore this dynamic in depth? Did any historical writers/theologians explore the relationship between the three?

If there's a better place to ask about this I'd appreciate being pointed that way.",Stoicism,1702198628.0,t3_18ezgl7,0.77,7

A prayer to think of Memento Mori,"Hi everybody,

I've been learning some poetry by heart lately to do something a bit more interesting than daydreaming.

I was wandering if anybody had a good idea of some sort of a poem/mantra/quote about memento mori. Something I could recite in my head when walking to work or simply waiting for the bus.

Hopefully it could be a bit longer than just a few sentence. Something of the length of the Invictus poem would be great.

When my preferences and reality part ways….,"**I prefer X. But X is absent in reality. Y is present. This makes me sad/disappointed/frustrated, etc. What is stoic advice or way of thinking?** 

For example:

*  I want the weather to be sunny. But it is cloudy. And it makes me sad. 
* I prefer people to be happy. But then I go out and few seem to be happy at least when I see them. It makes me disappointed. 
* I prefer people to be really connected to each other, face to face. I prefer genuine and honest communication. But I see a lot of people on their phone. Not talking to each other in the cafe. 
* I love people to be thoughtful, wise and have a certain depth in their thinking. But then I see many people who totally lack such characteristics. Result: Despair. 
* I prefer my life to be a series of successes. But it is not. It is a mixed baggage of success and failure. I feel unhappy.

I cannot journal without a prompt.,"One possession I prize highly is my copy of Ryan Holiday's The Daily Stoic Journal. I already filled out one copy and I'm halfway through my second one. I love this work because there are prompts that ask very specific guide questions to give me that writing impetus.

However, I noticed that I don't know what to write and how to organize my thoughts if I don't have specific prompts. I don't want to be limited by this book. I find it sad that even after several months of journaling, I still cannot fully let go of the need for a prompt. 

It's like...I'm ""running out of thoughts"". Sometimes, my mind would be cluttered and I want to write things down but I just can't seem to start without consulting my resources for specific guide questions. Nonetheless, I do think that the issue is not my lack of ideas but my failure to articulate them without a guide.

EVERYTHING that happens is preordained,"I feel anxious. I have to give a presentation tomorrow and I feel anxious. But that's not what worries me. What worries me is the very fact that I am anxious. I have read meditations hundreds of times, I shouldn't feel this way. I should be armed with the thought that nothing in the universe can happen that is bad, because what the universe creates is guided by the laws of logic and cannot be anything but good.

The problem here is with the ""should"". You simultaneously say that the universe cannot give way to something that is bad but at the same time say that what is happening right now is wrong. The universe is wrong, in this case. Everything that the universe has so far created, the big bang, the birth of humanity, the rise of democracy, have been good and without mistake - until today. You being anxious is the universe's first mistake.

Of course this makes no sense. By ""everything that happens is good"" it follows that your anxiety has to be good. If tomorrow you should feel so anxious that you throw up, that is good. A central problem with this line of thinking has to do with expectation. ""I feel like I have done everything right so I shouldn't be feeling this way."" The hardest part, I think, is truly letting go of this expectation. We practice philosophy or spiritualism or religion because we want to be happy but often it is this goal that gets in the way of that happiness. You will still keep practicing, but remember that it is not up to you how things will go or how you will feel. Feeling bad can be a symptom of a problem that you should try to fix but it is not the feeling itself that you should try to fix or even bother with at all.

Edit: This post isn't about the damned presentation. I dont have anxiety about a presentation. I dont even have a presentation.

On descriptions and prescriptions,"**Introduction**

I’m sure everyone already intuitively knows the difference between prescriptions and descriptions, and can easily explain the difference when asked to. Yet quite often I see people on here struggle to apply this distinction in their Stoic practice.

In this post I will attempt to show this distinction in the context of practicing Stoicism and how one can practice more effectively by keeping it in mind.

**The difference**

The definitions of the words as per the Cambridge dictionary:

Prescription:

>the act of telling someone else what they must have or do.

Description:

>something that tells you what something or someone is like.

In my own understanding, a description is a list of characteristics that is associated with someone or something whereas a prescription is a list of instructions you can follow. We can easily *describe* how it is like for a master musician to play on an instrument, but to *prescribe* the training to attain such skills is a completely different thing.

In the context of training, a description tells you the goal that you wish to attain, and a prescription tells you the process towards  attaining that goal. In the causality chain of events, a description is the consequence and a prescription is an antecedent cause.

What this means is it makes sense to use prescriptions as your practice but not descriptions, and this is really where I see people struggle with.

Consider this simple example. If you sprain an ankle, the description of a “recovered ankle” is “you can run”. Do you then “run” with the sprained ankle so that you match the description of a “recovered ankle”? Of course not, we all have enough common sense to know this is ridiculous. What you do is ""following the doctor’s treatment plan”, or the “prescription”, until “you can run”, at which point you know you have “recovered” because what you can do matches the description. Being able to run is caused by having recovered, which in turn is caused by following the treatment plan.

But “running to recover” is exactly what people are doing when they say something along the lines of “I’m practicing Stoicism by not being disturbed by externals”, or “I’m following the Stoic principle of the cardinal virtues”. Not being disturbed by externals and the virtues are *descriptions* of a practiced Stoic, they are not *prescriptions* for your practice.

Epictetus himself talked about this in the following excerpt:

>But if he has striven merely to attain the state which he finds in his books and works only at that, and has made that the goal of his travels, I bid him go home at once and not neglect his concerns there, since the goal to which he has travelled is nothing; but not so that other goal—to study how a man may rid his life of sorrows and lamentations, and of such cries as ""Woe is me!"" and ""Wretch that I am!"" and of misfortune and failure, and to learn the meaning of death, exile, prison, hemlock; that he may be able to say in prison, ""Dear Crito, if so it pleases the gods, so be it,"" rather than, ""Alas, poor me, an old man, it is for this that I have kept my grey hairs!""

\- The Discourses of Epictetus I.4

I believe this confusion is primarily caused by being introduced to the Meditations as their first Stoic reading material, which brings me to my next point.

**How it applies to the original texts**

As I mentioned just now, I’d bet my money on the Meditations being the primary cause of this confusion. That’s because the Meditations is mostly *descriptive,* there are very few passages in there I can think of that are actually *prescriptive.*

We need to remember, that Marcus had had decades of Stoic training when he wrote it - he was already one of the most well-versed Stoics in human history; and the Meditations was not written to teach others to be like him – it was his private journal. A master guitarist doesn’t need to write down in his journal where to place his fingers on the guitar, he will probably write something like “a 1-minute solo would fit nicely in this segment of this song”.

The Discourses of Epictetus is by far the most *prescriptive* book out of all the remaining original Stoic texts we have. Epictetus is also quite explicit whenever he states his instructions if you read it carefully. Even Marcus himself implied the importance of this book in his Stoic education on the very first page of the Meditations:

>7. From Rusticus: to get an impression of need for reform and treatment of character; not to run off into zeal for rhetoric, writing on speculative themes, discoursing on edifying texts, exhibiting in fanciful colours the ascetic or the philanthropist. To avoid oratory, poetry, and preciosity; not to parade at home in ceremonial costume or to do things of that kind; to write letters in the simple style, like his own from Sinuessa to my mother. To be easily recalled to myself and easily reconciled with those who provoke and offend, as soon as they are willing to meet me. To read books accurately and not be satisfied with superficial thinking about things or agree hurriedly with those who talk round a subject. **To have made the acquaintance of the** ***Discourses*** **of Epictetus, of which he allowed me to share a copy of his own.**

\- The Meditations, book I

There is another anecdotal evidence of this book being a primary education material to the ancient Stoics:

>With these words then the Stoic rid himself of the rich Asiatic. But later, when we were approaching Brundisium and sea and sky were calm, I asked him what the reason for his fear was, which he had refused to reveal to the man who had improperly addressed him. And he quietly and courteously replied: “Since you are desirous of knowing, hear what our forefathers, the founders of the Stoic sect, thought about that brief but inevitable and natural fear, or rather,” said he, “read it, for if you read it, you will be the more ready to believe it and you will remember it better.” **Thereupon before my eyes he drew from his little bag the fifth book of the** ***Discourses*** **of the philosopher Epictetus, which, as arranged by Arrian, undoubtedly agree with the writings of Zeno and Chrysippus.**

\- Aulus Gellius’ The Attic Nights

It should be abundantly clear at this point that the Discourses of Epictetus was amongst the most important Stoic learning materials at the time, and the people back then also had access to the works  of other prominent Stoic figures such as Zeno and Chrysippus. We are fortunate enough to still have access to this book in modern times (albeit half of it is lost), there is simply no reason we shouldn’t follow what the ancients did by using it as our main educational text.

Seneca’s letters and essays are also a decent source of instructional texts. The problem is his love of verbal barrage (he was a famous playwright at the time) means his writings are often very long-winded and in my opinion excessively sophisticated for the purpose of education.

I find his writings more poetic than they are educational, and I often find myself lost in a sort of “trance” when reading his texts, especially his essays. I still struggle to keep track of Seneca’s points when reading his essays to this day.

To me reading Seneca is something I do more for “reading pleasure” for a lack of better words than for learning. Of course that’s just me, if you have a different experience with reading Seneca then by all means do it as part of your learning.

**How we apply it in our Stoic practice**

A marathon runner and a sprinter both share the same goal of being the best at their sport, and thus to train their body to be at its physical peak in the most suitable way for their sport. But the marathon runner is primarily concerned with endurance whereas the sprinter speed. As such their training regimes have to be different.

It is also the case for our Stoic practice. Each of us has a different purpose, a different role to play in the cosmopolis; each of us has a different upbringing, different strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, how we train ourselves in the way of the Stoics must by necessity be different. Again I will quote Epictetus on this same point here:

>I am inclined to pleasure; I will betake myself to the opposite side of the rolling ship, and that beyond measure, so as to train myself. I am inclined to avoid hard work; I will strain and exercise my sense-impressions to this end, so that my aversion from everything of this kind shall cease. For who is the man in training? He is the man who practises not employing his desire, and practises employing his aversion only upon the things that are within the sphere of his moral purpose, yes, and practises particularly in the things that are difficult to master. **And so different men will have to practise particularly to meet different things**.

\- The Discourses of Epictetus III.12

**Conclusion**

In summary, if you wish to make progress in your Stoic training, it is important that you set yourself a description as a goal and devise a prescriptive plan to train yourself towards attaining that goal.

Don’t just start with a far-fetched goal like “I want to be like Marcus Aurelius!”. That’s like watching [a video of Van Halen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULEBSxP725w) and immediately saying “I want to play the guitar like him”, or reading about theoretical Physics for the first time and saying ""I want to win a Nobel prize in Physics!""

Start with something small and managable, something like “I want to stop being a slave to material wealth” if this is one of your weaknesses, then proceed to train yourself to get accustomed to a life with minimal material possessions.

It is also crucial that you are completely honest with yourself about your shortcomings, and be fully committed to follow the plan you devise, in the same vein you have to be completely honest with your doctor about your symptoms and follow her treatment plan if you want to recover most effectively from your illness.

Has anyone enrolled in the college of stoic philosophers?,"I finished Chris Fisher’s podcast and I’ve revisited some of the episodes. He mentioned the college of stoic philosophers a couple times and as someone who has always looked down on all these courses that are offered online (usually how to make quick money), this one is obviously different. So much content is available online these days for free but I wouldn’t mind paying to have a mentor. Anyway I decided to check it out anyway and to my surprise it’s only $100 tuition which is really nothing. Anyway you have to submit an essay (I’m an engineer by background and don’t remember the last time I wrote an essay) along with $100 to submit your application. Has anyone gone through with it?",Stoicism,1701980404.0,t3_18d4jb3,0.91,9
A Brief Gratitude for Stoicism,"I am from a developing country. If people from the developed world can be... well, untrustworthy, politically polarized, immature, horrible and so on, think developed world - economy and institutions and live with that for the rest of your life. I write this on every post in general so I think this has become essentially a part of my internet identity (and not my oh-so-glamorous IRL identity, unless I see discrimination here) 

So when I'm very grateful for Stoicism and the dichotomy of control. I've read and re-read original stoic texts countless times, with pencils and highlighting and all that good stuff. I would not claim I am an expert but if I've almost a decade of experience with 7 Habits of Effective People, I think I already have had a good introduction to Stoicism. Even the ""later"" stoics (big 3) abandoned stoic physics & stoic logic and just concerned themselves with stoic ethics (Discipline of Action) for the most part.

Stoicism as a school did not survive. But oh my god if we did not have the basic ability to focus on what is up to us (or ""control"") and did not have the ancient authors basically contributing to modern psychotherapy and science... I personally don't know how I'd deal with all the pressure and all my personal demons.

So thanks. I'm practically a first generation lawyer and hopefully will work as a District & Sessions judge before retirement. I think I'll never be called ""Justice <name>"" but that's perfectly fine. So, yeah, thank god for the good people behind stoicism and this sub. Even in this sub itself, things get pretty non-stoic and meta... but I think that's to be expected considering we're all humans and imperfect, like Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius and Cicero. 

So thank god for all the Stoic podcasts, authors, translators, and simply fellow students of this philosophy for sharing very good information with me. The first and foremost principle in Stoicism is the principle of Justice (a virtue) and personally I'd have gone crazy with my unorthodox lifestyle and unconventional life story if it weren't for Stoicism and related philosophies. So, thank you, fellow Stoics, for existing!",Stoicism,1701976565.0,t3_18d32ob,0.67,2
Life is suffering,"It is my understanding that the Stoics, similar to the Buddhists, advocate accepting that there is a certain amount of suffering in life.  I believe the Buddhists even say that life **IS** suffering.  Instead of waiting and being put off kilter by life's obstacles, the Stoics advocate premeditatio malorum, a kind of meditation on the negativity that might come your way in a given day.

&#x200B;

I don't use that morning meditation every day.  I tend to remember it when things in my life are trending downward; that's when I'm usually grasping at whatever tools I have to make my life better.  I do find it useful.

&#x200B;

More importantly, for me, is the mere acceptance or acknowledgment that my life circumstances are exactly as they must be, warts and all.  I have some influence, but I cannot control them.   Life cannot be without suffering, so I need to accept it as it is. 

&#x200B;

Similarly too, both the Stoics and Buddhist believe that reality itself is neutral, in terms of its significance, but that it's our judgments about the reality that can cause us to suffer.  I am continually having to remind myself of this truth when I go down the rabbit hole of negativity.

&#x200B;

Being more accepting of life's struggles means less suffering  because I'm not constantly craving what isn't.

&#x200B;

I'm a novice student of Stoicism and Buddhism, so I would appreciate any comments that clarify or even correct what I'm trying to say.

What is the point of this sub if not to help others?,"I’ve been on this sub for some time now and during my time here I’ve seen many including myself complain about posts seeking advice for their particular situation.

But what is the point of this sub if not to help others gain a better understanding of the philosophy through application and experience? Do you think the original teachers weren’t bombarded themselves with others seeking advice? What is it Marcus Aurelius said? “Be strict with yourself and patient with others”. Something along those lines. Where’s the patience? 

I often need outside help because I’m burdened with social disorders that make it difficult for me to understand situations as they are as opposed to how I view them personally. And that’s often difficult for me to separate. Of course with time I’ve grown in my patience and give myself the space I need to think things through, but I certainly needed as much help as I could get not even 6 months ago.

"If you want to improve, reject such reasonings as these: ""If I neglect my affairs, I'll have no income...","> If you want to improve, reject such reasonings as these: ""If I neglect my affairs, I'll have no income; if I don't correct my servant, he will be bad."" For it is better to die with hunger, exempt from grief and fear, than to live in affluence with perturbation; and it is better your servant should be bad, than you unhappy. 

Regarding [this passage](https://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html), I'm feeling a bit lost. 

As the income earner and as a parent it's my duty to provide for my family, but that means not neglecting my affairs -- especially financially.

And it is true that if I don't go to work, do a good job, maintain a career and such we may find ourselves with no income and no place to live.

How do you balance ensuring your affairs are in order while not falling for the trap Epictetus is describing here where you are unhappy/perturbed while fulfilling your duties?",Stoicism,1701965030.0,t3_18cytfo,0.93,12
Reference for a quote,"I have stumbled upon this wonderful quote of Marcus Aurelius:  


""*Don’t return to philosophy as a task-master, but as patients seek out relief in a treatment of sore eyes, or a dressing for a burn, or from an ointment. Regarding it this way, you’ll obey reason without putting it on display and rest easy in its care.*"" Book 5:9

Being in your late teens and early 20s,"So, we get a very steady stream of posts here along the lines of “I’m 18-25 and I don’t know what to do with my life, don’t understand why I haven’t achieved anything yet, don’t understand why the world seems so bleak and pointless, etc”.

The reason is that you’re 18-25. That period of life is exactly when you question everything, as you come out of childhood and start to work out how to be an adult. This is, in short, a very normal way to feel and a very normal process to go through. 

Don’t be afraid. Let the questions present themselves and allow yourself time to find the answers. Very very VERY few people have things figured out at this stage. Be patient and calm, and allow yourself to be young and still learning. It’s ok not to know what you’re doing yet.

Some questions from senecas on shortness of life,"From on shortness of life

""Vices assail and surround us on all sides, and they don’t allow  us to rise again and lift our eyes to the clear discernment of truth;  but they press down on them, keeping them lowered and ﬁ xed on  mere desire. It’s never possible for their victims to return to their  true selves. If by chance they ever ﬁ nd some respite, they still roll  restlessly, just like the deep sea, which still swells even after the wind  has settled; they never ﬁ nd full relaxation from their desires""



Q.1The way he said""It’s never possible for their victims to return to their  true selves""
I felt like it isn't possible even after they quoted the vices




""Look  back and recall when you were ever sure of your purpose; how few  days turned out as you’d intended; when you were ever at your own  disposal; when your face showed its own expression; when your mind  was free from disturbance; what accomplishment you can claim in  such a long life; how many have plundered your existence without  your being aware of what you were losing; how much time has been  lost to groundless anguish, foolish pleasure, greedy desire, the charms  of society; how little is left to you from your own store of time. You’ll  come to realize that you’re dying before your time.”



Q.2 The part ""how few  days turned out as you’d intended""



 I thought he was trying to say how life would be good if he quited slacking, but doesn't this phrase contradict with the others , I understood it as how few days that was like planned, did I miss understand it,

Wow just came back here after a few years. This sub has changed SO much in that time,"When I used to partake a lot in this sub about 4-5 years ago, it was almost exclusively posts about Stoic practice and some theory.

Now it’s basically, “I just broke up with my gf” or “how do I handle getting rejected by my crush?”

Nothing wrong with these questions, they have a place on an Internet forum for sure. But it’s just interesting how much the sub has changed away from actual Stoic focus since I last visited

I have no idea how to handle my breakup.,"We broke up with my partner 2 months ago after 5 years of being together, and my life has been a living hell since then. I lost my job, had to move back in with my parents, I have no friends, everyone in my family is completely unavailable emotionally so I can’t turn to anyone for emotional support and the therapist I’ve been seeing isn’t much help either. (she’s a great person and she’s helped me with other things but I just don’t feel like it helps much with this) Meanwhile she started seeing someone else less than a week after we broke up, and she seems very happy without me in her life. I keep having intrusive thoughts imagining of her enjoying life with her current partner, doing things we used to do together, having sex, etc.

I rediscovered stoicism recently and tried to apply some stoic principles to my situation. I understand that my feelings of jealousy and betrayal come from a misunderstanding of reality. I don’t own or control this person, she is free to do whatever she wants and I should not base my happiness/life on her presence in my life. But I just can’t change how I feel. I also can’t treat this like a learning opportunity, or to become a better person, because I don’t want that. I don’t look forward to anything in life, I just want to escape, I just want it to stop.

I'm not a rich man, but I do save well. I'm very frugal generally and have no want for material things. I prefer to travel.

But right now, I need to upgrade my house, it needs repainted, roof is leaky, it's dated.
Fixing it up is going to eat well into my savings and leave me pretty broke, it makes me feel uncomfortable, that I'm spending it all.

Should I forgive no matter what?,"Hello everyone, i’m relatively new to stoicism although I have been looking into stoic views for some time now. I am having trouble trying to decide the best course of action for my own mental and for my sports team regarding forgiveness of a teamate. A player on this sports team that I will call Jake brings down the entire team. Not just in a bad attitude towards the game way but in an instigator with his own teammates way. Jake and I were previously pretty close friends even spending some time together outside of our sport. Until Jake started being such a douche that I called him out for it. If you can’t tell yet, Jake isn’t the type of guy to appreciate being called out in front of his peers. We butted heads for many months but never let it affect us on the field. Recently it had gotten much worse as jake said cruel things to my face, gotten physical with me and my belongings/equipment, and tried to convince teamates I didn’t belong on the team. Now I am a pretty level headed guy, I didn’t let this affect me as I felt sorry for him because he is obviously lacking in some department to have to go after someone like this. What I refused to let happen was my image with others be tampered and for Jake to affect the chemistry of the team where it affects us in game play. During this period I looked at stoicism for guidance and I think I did the right thing. Not once did I raise my voice at Jake, lay my hands on jake, or even talk badly about jake to others. I reasoned that Jake is feeling a certain way and needs to take it out on others. 

Now I will skip some time and get to the part where i need advice. Jake came up to me personally and grabbed my hand shaking it and said “i’m sorry for being such a bad teammate, im working on it” I didn’t say “It’s okay” as being a bad teammate is not okay but i thanked him for his apology. My question is, in stoic principle should I be accepting Jake back into my life as a friend?",Stoicism,1701924045.0,t3_18cnmvp,0.75,6

My criticism of Stoicism,"My criticism has to do with the emphasis that the ancient stoic sages gave to various virtues. Early stoicism was greatly influenced by Socratic piety and its virtue ethics of justice, temperance, courage, and wisdom. Aristotelian ethics also greatly influenced the stoics. Aristotle proposed the following nine virtues: wisdom, prudence, justice, fortitude, courage, liberality, magnificence, magnanimity, and temperance. 

Absent in these virtues and the stoic writings is the virtue of agape. This is a selfless, unconditional love that transcends romantic or familial love. This love is central to Christian theology. The core texts on this love are the sermon on the mount, attributed to Jesus, and the writing of the apostle Paul. 

A parallel to agape or “Christian love” can be found in eastern wisdom traditions as well. In Buddhism, especially the Theravada tradition, they emphasize Metta or the cultivation of boundless, unconditional love and goodwill toward all living beings.

Now the stoics did emphasize benevolence and kindness towards others, but the conception of agape is never a central part of the stoic ethic. I consider myself a novice practicing stoic, and have found that as I continue to learn and grow, my practice of virtue has been improved as I have worked to prioritize the development of agape.",Stoicism,1701914706.0,t3_18ckotn,0.69,6

Yesterday I used the stoic advice for the first time efficiently after losing my wallet.,"So I took a bus home yesterday.

I left my wallet on the seat next to me. 

I was reading something on my phone about atomic bombs and I was very interested about it, so I didn’t do the lifesaver check I normally do on the area I’ve been before leave, so when I got home, where’s my wallet?

Back from work, tired, hungry, I started feeling like the rage and anger were increasing within myself.


“feck, it is not anywhere, I’m quite sure I forgot it on the bus, FECK, There’s always something new isn’t there? OF COURSE, how amazing of me, F*CK, I didn’t pay attention NOW I’m paying for this” 

All this dialogue going on in my head while I was brutally in a way throwing my blankets far away in the hopes I’d still find it somewhere in my room.

I was hungry but then I wasn’t anymore, like, how can I enjoy a fecking meal now?

At some stage I gave up, I froze my credit cards through the apps.

All of a sudden, however, this realization strikes me:

WAIT, I can’t control what happened, but I can control how I’m going to express my emotions after acknowledging whatever is happening on the surface.

So, magically I could gradually calm myself down, and for the first time I could actually use the stoic advice.

We only know if we really absorbed the philosophies when we face hard times.

Suddenly I was able to adopt a stoic posture in relation to what happened.

I thought logically that it wouldn’t be worth to ruminate about the whole “what-is-the-outcome”. 
Instead, I faced the possible reality of the facts and accepted it.

“I’ll call the bus station tomorrow, if they didn’t find anything, I’ll do all my documents once again, and that is it” 

I was filled with calmness once again.
I ate some food and the thought that would before become some kind of obsessive thinking barely went through my mind last night.

It was also interesting to see from time to time my mind trying to function in the “old” way. 
So I was reading something on my laptop and my mind randomly goes “My wallet, bro I lost my wallet, F*ck” and seconds later I’d also hear the thoughts “saying” “haven’t we talked about this already?” The end.

I lost things before because I used to be very forgetful.
This kind triggers something in me.
But THIS time it felt like I was in control after a LONGGG time.

It felt like there was a catalogue of emotions, and I picked one that made me feel “You don’t control what happened, but you control how you respond to it”


Ps: btw, I’ve called them and they have my wallet at the bus station. Yayy",Stoicism,1706262291.0,t3_1abepd9,0.88,24

Feeling unappreciated and disrespected,"Been reading/listening about Stoicism recently and would like know what Stoicism says about my situation which is as follows:

I have been with my company for very long time and just got a new role/ promotion 
within the company after a long time trying. During the transition with the new employee, I have noticed an utter lack of gratitude from my previous group and this new person. My social skills aren’t great but I am always very nice to my coworkers and tend to have a “people pleaser” quality. 
Feel little hurt that my work isn’t appreciated.  I know these are old coworkers but still feel disappointed after one spent so much time in a role.
The other thing, I have noticed people junior than me have gotten higher roles which has created an inferiority complex in me.
So both of those things seems to be bothering me a lot and causing stress.

Maintaining Confidence in One's Beliefs and Opinions Despite Disagreement from the Majority,"There were a couple of [studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments) done in the 1950s that looked at the influence of other people's opinions/beliefs on an individual's perception. These studies had a group of people view series of lines and determine which was the longest in each case. However, only one member of the group was actually a participant; the rest were actors. While the actors chose the correct lines in the beginning, over time they began, as a group, to select obviously incorrect lines as the longest. This had a marked influence on what the participant chose, and, despite many times having misgivings about the answer, ended up conforming in most cases.

I've noticed in my life that there are numerous opinions that I'm well read upon that most people disagree with reflexively. My opinions are controversial and I'm sure most of you here would disagree with me as well. However, I'm a logical individual and I try to learn about the reasoning of the disagreements through discussion and debate. Often times, however, I'm told I'm a bad person for having my beliefs, but I've not heard very substantive reasons that I'm mistaken: they're mostly value-based. I remain unconvinced.

At the same time, however, I can't help but always have doubt in my heart because so many people disagree with me. In fact, the more often, I hear I'm wrong, I'm more and more affected, even without a logical reason.

Rudyard Kipling says regarding being a man, ""If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, But make allowance for their doubting too"". I believe this fully. As a stoic, how does one balance trusting in his or her own beliefs while taking into account the input of others, even when they view you as a bad person for those beliefs?",Stoicism,1706272408.0,t3_1abhayh,0.76,4
Some things you may not know about Marcus Aurelius,"I was talking today to Brian Muraresku, author of the *Immortality Key*, about Marcus Aurelius and the Eleusinian mysteries and it occurred to me that it might be worth sharing a few bits of trivia that I've learned over the years while researching my (three!) books on Marcus' life and times, especially my biography, [Marcus Aurelius: The Stoic Emperor](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300256666/marcus-aurelius/).  None of this is earth-shattering but I think they're things most people haven't heard about, which help make Marcus a more three-dimensional character, and for many people, like myself, being able to visualize the author can help them get more out of reading the *Meditations*.

1. There is a bust of Marcus Aurelius that survives today in the grounds of the temple complex at Elefsina, just outside Athens, where it once adorned the pediment of the *propylaea* or main gate leading into the temple of Demeter, used for the famous Eleusinian Mysteries.  It seems to be circled with poppy flowers, a symbol of Demeter.  We know Marcus went here around 176 CE to be initiated and presumably drank the famous kykeon, which Brian believes contained *ergot*, a hallucinogenic drug.  Marcus became a patron of Eleusis, paying to rebuild the temple after it was sacked during the First Marcomannic War, by Sarmatian raiders.
2. Some people believe we know nothing about Marcus' life when in fact we know far more about him than we do about almost any other ancient philosopher, because he was a famous emperor.  We have the *Meditations*, of course, but also three Roman histories of his reign: Cassius Dio's *Historia Romana*, the *Historia Augusta*, and Herodian's *History of the Empire from the Death of Marcus*.  There are also many fragmentary references to Marcus in other surviving texts.   
 But we also have numismatic evidence (from coins and medallions), statues, inscriptions, and other archeological evidence.  Some of you may know we have a cache of private letters between Marcus and his rhetoric tutor, Marcus Cornelius Fronto, discovered in the 19th century.    Perhaps the least well-known source of information exists in the Roman legal digests, which contain hundreds of references to Marcus' legislative activity, and which some scholars have used to try to reconstruct a picture of his political agenda.
3. In Carnuntum, in Austria, there's a huge archeological park, with an entire working reconstruction of a 2nd century Roman villa, and many ruins from around the time of Marcus Aurelius, as well as three museums.  Marcus famously mentions being stationed at the legionary fortress here, on the banks of the Danube, when he was writing the *Meditations*.  If you ever get a chance - go there!  It's an amazing location, just outside Vienna.
4. I had a chance to [interview the director of archeology](https://youtu.be/qALCMTLND0g?si=e0e_4DcyqXVTlmP4) at the park and ask him if they had discovered anything that could shed light on Marcus' life.  It's often difficult to tie in archeological finds with textual evidence - when you do that's kind of gold dust for historians!  However, they found the funeral stele at Carnuntum of a Praetorian which is dated 171 CE.  The Praetorians are the emperor's personal cohort of guards so it strongly suggests that Marcus would have been there at that point in time, which confirms the date historians have inferred from textual evidence.  He was probably writing the *Meditations* at Carnuntum in 171 CE.
5. We say Marcus became emperor in 161 CE because that's when he was given the title augustus but at this time the office of emperor doesn't really correspond with our English word, e.g., it's composed of several titles and powers, some of which can be shared, whereas others cannot, and which can be assumed at different times.  Marcus was actually granted most of the imperial powers in 147 CE, after the birth of his first child.  So for over 13 years, Marcus ruled alongside Emperor Antoninus Pius, as Caesar, imperator, husband of an Augusta, and wielding the tribunician power in the Senate.  They were notoriously only ever apart for a few days.  I would say Marcus was a *de facto* or virtual (albeit junior) co-emperor, alongside Antoninus, for many years before we normally think of him assuming power. 

If anyone is interested, maybe we could do another AMA or something in this Subreddit talking about research on Marcus Aurelius' life. ",Stoicism,1706216625.0,t3_19fjtcd,0.95,68
How to Deal With a Mothers Concerns,"Hey fellow Stoics,

Just wanted to share a common struggle many of us might face – dealing with a parent who's overly concerned about our life and relationships. It can get quite annoying. How do you guys maintain your stoic principles in such situations? How do you keep your cool among well-intentioned but sometimes overwhelming concern?",Stoicism,1706285302.0,t3_1abluhw,0.75,2
"""The slightest movement frightens him(me) out of his life.His baggage makes him(me) a coward""","I read Seneca's letter 63(someone here recommended it)about grieving a death. In the end it said, ""you lost someone you love, now find someone to love"". I took it out of context replacing ""love"" with ""trust"" and death with general rejection. By the way the title is from the letter before 63. But I struggle with trusting again after I've trusted and it has led to being rejected in one form or another. Be it in relationships or in expressing yourself freely as in being who you really are. And yes we are only entitled to our actions and not their results but a statement from Seneca like, ""he who while he gives thinks of what he will get in return deserves to be decieved"" is an oxymoron because aren't we biologically hardwired to expect a return(consciously or unconsciously) and for good reason? To be like ""a bee when the honey is stored"" or, in being virtuous to be the like the sun that shines on all people everyday without judgement regardless of what horrible things they've done is to not account for human emotions(which, let's face it is part of what makes us human). And even if I do the right rational thing, it doesn't eliminate the influences of these emotions. So baggage, what brene brown called ""armor"" for someone with trauma exists to protect me, saying to me, ""if you take off this armor, we die"", but she(Brown) would have you believe that this armor also holds us back from being everything we can be. On some level, I am a coward, regarding love for example because it involves an element of loading my unfinished business(baggage) on someone, expecting to get something from them that I didn't get in the past and ofcourse this is like setting myself up for disappointment because the only one who can fulfill such expectations is me. Meditations 6.20 concludes by saying ""we need to excuse what our sparring partners do and just keep our distance, WITHOUT SUSPICION OR HATRED"" and I ask myself..how?. Epictetus says Archilles was ruined the moment he forgot he was at Troy to fight, not the get women. But if this was preordained by the logos, how can it be considered ruin? Mark Twain wrote that we should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is in it and stop there. I am the cat he talks about. The one that sits down on a hot stove lid. He will never sit down on a hot stove lid again-and that is well, but he will also never sit down on a cold one anymore.I struggle with the past being my master instead of my teacher, because a part of me believes that only as my master can it strengthen my ""memory of the future"". It's only in moments when I'm overwhelmed by an appearance, caught up in a moment, it's only then that my past experiences become non existant and I am able to act boldly and audaciously. Perhaps that's courage?, I don't believe so because in those moments I am not being consciously vulnerable. I don't think I am capable of concious vulnerability, but perhaps ""unconscious vulnerability"" also counts as courage.",Stoicism,1706260007.0,t3_1abe6u7,1.0,3

I am stuck. I need help," 

I am a high school student from India. I am stuck in a situation, which I think, Only stoicism could solve.

Actually I am fooling myself. I am preparing for JEE. world's second toughest exam. Now to main thing

 Whenever there is any test. I try to skip it. Not because I hadn't studied the topics, but because my performance is below my peers. The JEE system pushes  emphasis on your result and ranking. Thus making everybody, ie your fellow classmates, Your potential enemy. Recently I scored 18/100 while the average was 45/100. Now I can handle low points in my life but for 6 months, no matter how hard I try, I never score more than my peers' average.

Also, I've recently started procrastinating. To be honest, This is not procrastination. This is a fear. Actually my dad is obsessed with JEE. But since my performance has been low for a long time, He just says that I am trash. I ignored him for a few months, but now I really feel that I am trash. I am scared of examinations because of my dad's reaction. 

So, Whenever I study and I get stuck on a topic, I really feel that I am trash.

This feeling also takes away all of the fulfilment. And then, whenever I go to my doubts teacher, I feel like an imposter. I feel that I have not studied or I have not done anything meant to be done before doing the question sets. All of these sometimes leaves me hopeless and sometimes suicidal too.

 I believe Journaling can only help to a limit. 

And whenever I sit to study I feel as if it's not worth it . All of the studying is just drama. And I actually do think that I am doing drama.

Then there is another problem. Germany offers free education for people who want to immigrate to Germany for a long time. and whenever I ask whether JEE is worth it or not, a thought always comes that Germany is still my backup option. and then I waste my time dreaming about peaceful german way of doing things instead of the Indian way. (and I really hate my country's work culture) 

You could say ""focus on progress, not perfection), Well here I am. It's been 6 months and I really feel that I have achieved nothing. I gave up on dating girls just so that I could focus on studies, I also moved away from all of my friends who were not interested in studies, Just so that I could focus on myself and I couldn't even do that properly. 

I don't know what stoics would do in this situation. But for me there seems only two ways, One reaching out to someone like you guys and Second, suicide ",Stoicism,1706213026.0,t3_19fidux,0.8,3

*""... learn the single principle of despising life. 'What? Did you not mean 'control' instead of 'despise'? No; 'controlling' is the second task; for no one has controlled his life aright unless he has first learned to despise it. Farewell. ""*

What does he mean by ""despising life""? Is this an awkward translation and simply another way of saying we should be detached from life's externals, material possessions and irrational fears?

I know he's not saying, ""Hate life."" Perhaps he's saying something closer to ""despise uncontrollable bullshit, before controlling what you can control.""

Thoughts?

&#x200B;

Edit: Those below have brought to my attention that the original Greek word is better translation to something closer to ""regard as unimportant"" or ""consider negligible"" or ""of little value/importance.""

The Lie of Perception,"Wherever we go, whoever we talk to, whatever we do, has perception behind it. **But as a result of that,** life is not naked.

🧖 Naked? N*aked.* We hold connotations to almost everything we see, hence, our life does not have the b*are-bones naked perception.*

And **Marcus Aurelius directly** encouraged himself to have these **naked perceptions** to remain indifferent, which lead him to write this passage:

>“Like seeing roasted meat and other dishes in front of you and suddenly realizing: This is a dead fish. A dead bird. A dead pig.

>Or that this noble vintage is grape juice, and the purple robes are sheep wool dyed with shellfish blood.

>Or making love - something rubbing against your penis, a brief seizure, and a little cloudy liquid.

>Perceptions like that - latching onto things and piercing through them, so we see what they really are. That's what we need to do all the time - all through our lives when things lay claim to our trust - to lay them bare and see how pointless they are, to strip away the legend that encrusts them.""

>Marcus Aurelius, Meditations (6.13)

🥩 Meat is a dead animal.

👚 Clothes are materials with synthetic dyes.

❤️ Sex is two bodies rubbing together for temporary pleasure.

That **doesn’t mean we should avoid it;** but instead, recognize that it is an indifferent to us. Continue eating meat, wearing clothes (obviously), and having sex, on the basis you’re not allowing these things to **control** you or change your perceptions.

Once you allow *externals to control you,* you become *a slave to yourself* and emotions, which is completely contrary to what the Stoics strived for day-in, day-out.

**We all know the clouded perception we have when we are urged or tempted.**

And these *urges/temptations* are caused by these perceptions.

**See things naked**.

Falsely accused but lying and agreeing to the accusation would save the relationship. What would you do?,"
Throughout my life I watched people lie. Lie to get the desired outcome they were seeking. Lie to make themselves appear more prestigious than how they thought society viewed them. Lie to cover an embarrassing moment or situation. Lie as a way to receive love or kindness from others. Lie to protect their families. Lie to provide a decent life for those they love. Lie to advance in their career. Whatever the reason, I can empathize with some decisions to lie but I couldn’t condone it. 

I’ve lied. I’ve lied many times in my life. 
I’ve lied to secure a higher paying job bc society told the hiring managers I wasn’t qualified bc I didn’t have the notable title that said I was capable.  I’ve lied to advance in my career so I could afford to feed my children without the help of foods stamps. I’ve lied to cover shameful situations with the hopes of not disappointing anyone, yet that was never going to be the outcome. I lied to project perfectionism so that I could fly under the radar so that everyone around me could be happy. Even after I was told I could be honest, I still lied. I heard that statement over and over in my lifetime and yet being honest didn’t put food on the table, allow me to pay my water bill before it got shut off for the 3rd time. Being open and vulnerable didn’t encourage those meant to protect me, to do the right thing.  

The time came and I was shown that humans aren’t perfect. They make mistakes. Their mistakes aren’t excusable but what they do moving forward is the only way to make amends, even if no one outside of myself can see the change. I know and the Universe knows. 

I made a promise that I wouldn’t lie again.  No matter the situation. No matter the outcome.  No matter what- I would be truthful and forthcoming. Even if that meant uncomfortable consequences or loss. I’ve stuck to that promise and I’ve worked through the anxiety of having the uncomfortable conversations, the fear that comes from being judged and idea that I don’t have to be perfect to be loved. 

Yet I sit here in a situation where I have the opportunity to lie knowing that the outcome would allow me to stay in a relationship that I would be devastated to lose.  But I can’t…..I want to so badly but I can’t and I’m so angry bc I can’t.  I could hear the “ but no one would know and you can just fix it right now….” Yet that voice isn’t even recognizable to me anymore. I would know! I would carry that heavy weight knowing that I lied to someone I loved and I broke the promise to the most important person in my world….me. 

So, here I am facing the consequences of telling the truth. Having to accept that no matter how hard I’ve tried to prove that I did not do what I’m being accused of, if I would just lie to confirm the accusations then we could work through anything.  Knowing that I’ve lost someone so special to me and all I would need to do to fix everything is lie…..",Stoicism,1706159807.0,t3_19f1rdg,0.44,0

Hope to cope with this Tragedy of 2 years,"I’m 28 M

How do I cope with the fact that I lost two years of my career journey when I went overseas to build a holiday house for my family?

I initially thought I could study online, but I was wrong, and as a result, I wasted two years. My degree, which was supposed to finish in 2022, is now finishing in 2024. Additionally, I missed out on the experience I could have gained in my field. Now I’m jobless with 1 year more to go. My GPA dropped from 3.0 to 2.2 while I was taking 1 subject per semester overseas and failed 1 subject when I took 2.

my ego and arrogance is growing ever since I became more confident and idk what to do,"When I was a little kid I was an asshole. I didn't really understand at the time until my friends started sharing stories of how I was a complete bully before they knew me, or even when we were friends in middle school. 

In highschool and college I got humbled. No one really liked being around me and a lot of that turned to self hate. Am I really that annoying, am I super ugly, am I not funny or entertaining, why dont people seem to like being around me?

I have spent YEARS self hating because I couldn't understand why I wasn't very likeable. 

Recently I started trying to work on myself and meet more people. 

Here's the thing. Turns out im a really likeable person. I started a new job and everyone loves me there. Not trying to blow smoke up my own ass but the higher up's are always praising me, I keep getting invited to out of work events from multiple coworkers, my friendships are strengthening with them, people are talking good about me behind my back. 

I went half my life thinking im this insanely annoying, unlikeable, lazy, worthless piece of shit. 

Turns out once I stop shitting on people, they actually start enjoying being around me.

Anyways, now im at the point where I know how good I am, both with work and social relationships, and I cant help but feel a bit arrogant. 

Im slacking on my job because I feel invincible. Im being a bit harsh on people because I feel like im above them, Im more aggressive with my jokes because I feel like everyone's on my side...

Half-Sister [50F] reached out to me [42M]: Turns out she's racist and transphobic. How do I empathically and assertively reply?,"TLDR: Half-sister wants to connect but she's clearly got racist and transphobic attitudes that I don't want to just ignore. Do I work with her on it, ask her to just not say that stuff to me, or slam the door, or is there another way?

My dad quite likely got a girlfriend pregnant about a year or two before meeting my mum, though both mum and dad both died 8 years ago. The daughter, ""Rachel"", actually reached out to him by letter when I was a teen. They told us 4 kids about it, but to my disappointment they didn't continue contact with her (as far as I know).

She recently reached out to us 4 siblings to get to know us, and we've talked about getting paternity testing for peace of mind. I'm pretty sure she's our dad's daughter, but as a loner introvert I (and one brother) would prefer empirically knowing before investing in a whole new relationship.

She currently lives overseas with her husband and visited my country last year with a view to moving back here. There wasn't time for either parties to meet in person, but in her summary of her trip she said ""I""m not racist but..."" and then talked about one of the major cities as having ""too many <nationality>, <nationality>, <religion>"", them being rude and hard to get to know, and ""it felt like being in <other nation>"".

She also talked about wanting to move to one of the country towns where ""it's easy to get to know people there and they're so nice and it's just like being back in the old times"".

She's also has previously talked about people that are transexual as not being the gender they're transitioned to, using sports and genetics as her arguments. In that conversation I talked about the variety of sex characteristics, the discrimination that even cis people get for not showing them all, and I tried expressing empathy about the struggles of people that transition or are transitioning.

I tried gentle challenging rather than being confrontational, though it seemed like she held her opinions very strongly. She concluded that we'd ""agree to disagree"".

On the plus side, she's expressed being bisexual, doing some casual drag, and shows no homophobia to my sexuality. But with this additional issue, she clearly yearns for living in a location with little racial or gender diversity, and I can see that I probably can't change her values about her racism and transphobia any time soon.

I personally want to behave according to my principles of compassion, integrity, courage, and truth. I also don't have the energy or time to try empathising with her through these horrible attitudes with the hope that she'll someday open her heart and mind to people different to her.

How do I assertively reply to this while standing by my values?

EDIT:  I forgot to mention Justice as a principle. I'm wondering if there are there any references to virtuous use of time that would also help with figuring out how much to commit to these unjust attitudes and this relationship overall?

"Did you there was a very influential form of Stoic psychotherapy in the early 20th century, which almost everyone forgot about?","This is a short excerpt from an article I wrote for *The Cambridge Companion to Marcus Aurelius' Meditations*, edited by Dr. John Sellars.  I wish I could share the whole article.  I wanted to publish it here as I know very few people are aware of the fact that an explicitly *Stoic-influenced approach to psychotherapy* was once quite common, at the start of the 20th century.  Dubois and his colleagues often write beautifully and express self-help ideas derived from Stoicism in quite striking and memorable language.  One day, maybe, it would be great to write a popular self-help book based on this forgotten form of Stoic cognitive therapy and explore its relationship with ancient Stoicism in a lot more detail.  I hope some of you find the self-improvement ideas and techniques here helpful.  *Enjoy!*

# Stoicism in Early 20th Century Psychotherapy

Dubois was the first modern psychotherapist to draw directly on Stoicism.  During the first few decades of the 20th century, he was Freud’s main rival.  Indeed, at the First International Congress of Psychiatry and Neurology, in 1907, there was considerable opposition to Freudian psychoanalysis, the more conventional techniques of persuasion and suggestion being still considered central to psychotherapy. 

>Dubois told of his method of treating phobias. Emotions, he said, always follow ideas, so the treatment should go to the root, namely, the erroneous idea the patient has allowed to creep into his mind. (Ellenberger 1970: 797)

Dubois not only shared with the Stoics the premise that emotions are fundamentally cognitive in nature but also the conclusion that by cross-examining someone’s underlying beliefs, through a form of Socratic questioning, we can help them therapeutically.  The psychoanalysts had little or no interest in the methods of ancient philosophy.  In contrast, Dubois clearly stated that he saw Socrates and the Stoics, including Marcus Aurelius, as the forerunners of his own “rational” approach to psychotherapy. 

>If we eliminate from ancient writings a few allusions that gave them local colour, we shall find the ideas of Socrates, Epictetus, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius absolutely modern and applicable to our times. (Dubois 1909: 108-109) 

Dubois noted that, paradoxically, the Stoic words of advice he read in the letters of Seneca, although written in the first century AD, “seem to be drawn from a modern treatise on psychotherapy.”  Moreover, even when Dubois isn’t directly quoting the Stoics, we may detect signs of their influence upon him.  

>We should react briskly, act enthusiastically for good, obey the impulse of our better feelings. But however spontaneous this reaction may be, we must nevertheless leave time for calm reason to exercise a rapid control. Our reason is that which as an arbiter judges finally the value of the emotions of sensibility which make us act. If it is a sentiment of goodness, of pity, which carries us away, reason very quickly gives its approval. But when we are about to give way to a feeling of anger, envy, vexation, reason should intervene to correct the first impression and modify the final decision. (Dubois & Gallatin 1908: 56)

Following the teachings of Epictetus, Marcus likewise reminds himself never to “allow yourself to be wholly carried away by your impressions” (Med. 5.36) for “things go well for a rational nature when it never gives its assent to a false or doubtful impression” (Med. 8.7).  Indeed, this advice to remain mindful that we are not “carried away” by strong desires and emotions seems to have been implied in the writings of Chrysippus and endured all the way down to the time of *The Meditations*.  

Like therapists today, Dubois often recommended reading to his patients as homework.  He felt it was necessary to direct them toward more inspirational and improving texts, “the moralists of all times, and especially to the ancient philosophers, who have portrayed the human soul as the artists of their time fixed the ideal form of  the human body in marble.”  He refers his readers both to the Epicureans and to their rivals the Stoics, particularly the letters of Seneca, *The Handbook* of Epictetus and *The Meditations* of Marcus Aurelius.  “In these works of our predecessors”, he says, “there is an inexhaustible treasure of accurate and fine thought.”  In other words, Dubois considered the perfect complement to his rational psychotherapy sessions to be prescribed reading of the Stoics, including Marcus Aurelius.

Dubois gives the impression, though, of having been more influenced by Seneca.  He mentions him more frequently than the other Stoics.  He also tells a memorable story about a young man to whom he’d prescribed reading Seneca’s letters as therapeutic homework.  As is often the case, the client had grasped the basic idea and was racing ahead of the therapist.  

>A young man into whom I tried to instil a few principles of stoicism towards ailments stopped me at the first words, saying, “I understand, doctor; let me show you.” And taking a pencil he drew a large black spot on a piece of paper. “This,” said he, “is the disease, in its most general sense, the physical trouble – rheumatism, toothache, what you will – moral trouble, sadness, discouragement, melancholy. If I acknowledge it by fixing my attention upon it, I already trace a circle to the periphery of the black spot, and it has become larger. If I affirm it with acerbity the spot is increased by a new circle. There I am, busied with my pain, hunting for means to get rid of it, and the spot only becomes larger. If I preoccupy myself with it, if I fear the consequences, if I see the future gloomily, I have doubled or trebled the original spot.” And, showing me the central point of the circle, the trouble reduced to its simplest expression, he said with a smile, “Should I not have done better to leave it as it was?”

Dubois concludes:

>“One exaggerates, imagines, anticipates affliction,” wrote Seneca. For a long time, I have told my discouraged patients and have repeated to myself, “Do not let us build a second story to our sorrow by being sorry for our sorrow.” (Dubois 1909: 235-236)

He adds that this diagram illustrates that “He who knows how to suffer suffers less.” The burden of physical pain or illness is light when we are able to look at it objectively, without drawing “concentric circles” around it, which multiply our suffering by adding layers of fear.  Although the inspiration for this patient’s rather compelling analogy came from reading Seneca, Dubois had also read *The Meditations*, where he would have encountered the same idea.  

>Let anything from outside that so wishes happen to the parts of me which can be affected by this event; for it is up to them, if that is their will, to make their complaint. But I myself, if I do not suppose that anything bad has happened to me, have yet to suffer any harm; and it is open to me not to make that supposition. (Med. 7.14)

As Marcus put it, our passions do us more harm than the things we’re upset about (Med. 11.18).

Another major Stoic theme in Dubois’ writings is the idea that we should learn to accept events that lie beyond our control.  This is interwoven with observations about causal determinism.  Dubois was an ardent compatibilist, like the Stoics, who believed that the popular concept of absolute “freewill’ derived from metaphysical libertarianism lay at the root of many psychological maladies.  We blame people to an irrational degree when we interpret their actions as being uncaused except by their own volition.  This leads to pathological anger towards others or, when we blame ourselves, to pathological guilt and depression.  Dubois believed that to understand all is to forgive all.  Empathic understanding, though, requires acceptance of the philosophical position that their actions have antecedent natural causes – people do what they do for a reason.

Dubois is led to advocate a philosophy of empathic understanding and brotherly love on the basis of his acceptance of universal causal determinism.  He quotes Marcus Aurelius’ saying, ""Love men with all thy heart"" (Dubois 1909), in order to equate it with the words of Christ, ""Love your neighbour as yourself,"" which he says condenses admirably the moral precept known as the Golden Rule. 

>All things therefore whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, even so do ye also unto them.  (Matt. 7.12)

Although Marcus doesn’t quite state this principle in the same terms, he does refer several times to the Stoic themes of kinship with our fellow men, and the doctrine that we are social creatures designed by Nature for mutual cooperation. 

>Nor can I be angry with my kinsman, nor hate him, for we are made for cooperation, like feet, like hands, like eyelids, like the rows of the upper and lower teeth. To act against one another then is contrary to nature; and it is acting against one another to be vexed and to turn away. (Med. 2.1)

Dubois perhaps had passages such as these in mind when he brings Marcus into his discussion of the Golden Rule.",Stoicism,1705985535.0,t3_19dgev0,0.94,37

How to Stay Committed to Diet,"Before going down the road of philosphy at 25 (driven mainly by Stoicism and Taoism) I made a promise to myself. I looked and saw that I had spent most of my adulthood in bad relationship followed by bad relationship. From this I wanted to spend 5 years on a Romance-Free Diet with a leeway of 3 years. This time single, I feel, will give me ample opportunity to hone myself more as an individual.

I am not celibate by any means. I wish to only have physical relations with someone in a spur the moment rather than intentionally seeking it out. This, while cutting out dating and all that crush chasing.

My issue is that as I grow as a person through these mediums of philosophy and psychology self-help, I have become way more charming of a guy. Now I get looks and flirtations from women that would leave a younger version of myself envious. I'm not trying to be some casanova, nor do I relate myself to one. However I do find myself flirting back with some of these women to the point where I'm making plans with one and having a lot of back and forth messaging with another (who is a superior at work no less lol).

When I come home and reflect at the end of the day, I write of guilt. Guilt from the idea that I'm not keeping fully committed to myself. I do well in keeping away from the shame trap, though something tells me I'm making missteps. This message, however, is foggy in the eye of my mind at best.

What do you think of this? Is there any lessons from Stoicism that might help me reach a little more clarity here?",Stoicism,1706050223.0,t3_19e1iwv,0.57,1
"I worry about death, wasting my life not being productive causes me to suffer","I've largely internalized the concept that I will die someday, everyone will forget me and therefore I shouldn't waste the time I have.

But this has had the unexpected effect that now I stress each day and wonder if I've done enough and made good enough use of each day.

I work and plan to the point of exhaustion.

When I do find time for rest, I stress about being lazy and find myself unable to enjoy myself or do things for my own enjoyment because I know that comes at the cost of not doing other tasks that need doing.

People tell me I should rest, but I don't know how to balance resting and tending to what's important in my life, and this leads to me to become paralyzed and anxious at times, unable to rationally think things through because I'm too stressed about not being productive.

At the risk of sounding like I’m ranting, I work in a production job. My boss is…very much a boss if that makes sense. 

Long story short, she essentially wanted me to finish an hour and a half job in the last 30 minutes of the day.

There’s nothing more I could have done.

Do Gut Microbes Affect Your Prohairesis? | Kathleen McAuliffe | TED,"McAuliffe is an adjunct professor at the University of Miami where she is currently teaching a course on the human microbiome.

In this Ted talk she describes the research that was done with “bubble mice”. Mice grown up in such a sterile environment that they don’t have the gut microbial biome that wild mice have. Her video states that introducing the gut flora of a depressed person to these mice also makes them depressed. And how changes in their gut change the mice’s decision making processes affecting their drive, curiosity and so on.

She goes on to speculate based on other research that the bacteria in our gut contribute to our behaviour by producing the chemicals our brain interprets, and even says they stimulate the vagus nerve directly.

Why We Shouldn't Give Up,"When we’re physically exhausted, there are a lot of remedies: relaxing, sleeping, resting, etc…

But when we’re mentally exhausted, our minds gravitate to only one solution: *giving up.*

I know for me personally, when I feel like I've had enough I always get thoughts like *“Is this even worth it?”* or *“Why am I doing this?”* or the infamous ""*I don't feel like doing this anymore.""*

Mental exhaustion will make us give up long before our physical exhaustion gets to us. At times, I simply felt like kicking the can and throwing everything off my desk. But Marcus Aurelius reminds us that **it is a mistake** to do so:

&#x200B;

> ""Disgraceful: for the soul to give up when the body is still going strong."" - Meditations (6.29)

&#x200B;

Physically giving up because of mental exhaustion thwarts our human nature to persevere. Thwarting perseverance makes us give up the difficult (and most likely beneficial) long-run for short-term rest. 

We should recognize that feelings are constantly fleeting; what you feel today may quite possibly be the opposite of what you feel tomorrow. 

*I do agree that there are times where you should give up without taking things to the extreme: If you're injured, give up on working the injured body part temporarily. If you recently have started a business and you can't see yourself doing it a few years down the future, give up before you become too invested into it.* 

**But we should discern these feelings from giving up simply because of laziness/exhaustion.**

On whatever venture you’re walking down that you're confident in, it will be difficult. It will most likely question why you’re walking down it in the first place. It will give you mental exhaustion to heights you may not expect. I know I have questioned myself whenever I embarked on difficult ventures, 100%.

But **who said** it’s not supposed to be like that? 

We owe it to ourselves to not give up because of a fleeting feeling, trading off short-term comfort for a potentially better future.

Im tired of everything. I want to improve and change so badly. I wanna do the work just dont know what to work on. What actionable steps do i take??,"These are my thoughts: I dont like this clown guy trying everything just to entertain and please others, or be needy or desperate and says things and gets ignored, or overexplains and they just reply with one words, or his ""friendships"" are all one sided and no one asks about him, or tries too hard or makes fun of himself just to make others laugh or takes things personally or insults others or puts others down, im 2 years into college and still have no friends, its like i want to feel important heard and seen by everyone, and i feel like i have nothing to offer, and i get forgotten quickly, i hate this guy. 

Its like i try to put on a performance for others like am a circus clown. And try to entertain them and i dont really get to know them because i dont know what to talk about. 

I know i bore others, and others aren't interested in me, maybe im not truly interested in them and i just want to get their attention and approval just to feel better about my self. Its like im a sucker for attention and approval. I hate this guy. 

I think my problem is self esteem and confidence. 

Many said to find my interests, and do things that make me happy on my own, and im trying really hard to stay away from porn, i try to dress nicely. And try to be respectful, im reading, 

 i try to ask questions about others,but still get end up getting ghosted in real life or texting, in texting its way more common and i think irl people just respond to be nice. 


I got called boring, a girl said that i had too much free time because i was trying to entertain her with my stories, and i wasnt interested in her i was more interested in her giving me attention and laughing so i feel better about my self. Selfish af i know. 

Im tired of trying to make people the source of my happiness . Im trying to find happiness on my own. Being happy about the little things, fighting my negative battles and setting boundaries, being greatful for just being alive, not depending much entire personality on others reactions, and not counting every thought as reality. But once i fail an interaction it all goes downhill or i get ignored . And tell myself ""i knew it"" i even try to tell my self that maybe my behavior was wrong not my personality

I guess it all goes back to basing my self worth on others actions and thoughts and words towards me

Now before any interaction i tell my self that my self worth isnt based on others reactions or opinions. 

I know others are attracted to positivity and how you make them feel when you are with them, i know i shouldn't text just because im bored

So now what? Do i pick something i dont like about my self and work on it since self improvement is so vague, Find a hobby an interest a passion? Do i keep reading? I wanna take action to change my self. I dont wanna just keep repeating the same freaking cycle that am stuck in, i dont wanna keep coming here and asking for advice and still be the same people pleaser. 

Im even trying to change my self beliefs by doing or saying things that i like and avoiding things that i dont like. 

I keep trying to find whats most important to me, it should be me but what? Things that make me happy? 

Everyday i go to my roof and some suicidal thoughts come in but i tell my self that im not someone who gives up. But i also dont wanna keep wasting time and my effort with no results... 

And maybe im still trying to base my efforts on others reactions. Like i say something or do something and it doesn't go well i tell my self that i haven't learned anything... maybe im still seeing ""making friends""  as a goal to achieve to feel better about my self. 

Maybe i need to accept my self and my life. But still work on things i need to improve",Stoicism,1705953980.0,t3_19d4w7j,0.7,5

Axioms of accountability,"This is something I've been considering for a while, and I thought maybe others would want to add to it. I would like to flesh out a modern stoic system in formal logic. It uses what I would call philosophical logic, basically modal predicate logic. No symbols, everything is written in terse English that can be easily interpreted as philosophical logic. First person pronouns can be universalized to other people. I haven't pre-written any of this out and I request critique. 

First, a lexicon. These are the predicates used below with variables indicate arguments.

- x belongs to y
- x is internal to y
- x is external to y

Here are the axioms of accountability:

1. Nothing that belongs to me belongs to another. (axiom of accountability)
2. Everything is either external or internal to me and not both. 
3. Everything that belongs to me is internal to me.
4. Not everything that is internal to me belongs to me.

Deductions: 

- Nothing external to me belongs to me. (2 and 3)
- Something internal to me belongs to another. (1 and 4)

No doctor or dermatologist have ever been able to figure out the cause, and I’ve tried many harsh courses of various medications without any long term effect (except for giving me a few frustrating long term side effects, from accutane especially). 
I’ve done and am doing everything within my control - I live healthy, I avoid potential food triggers, I’ve found the best routines to manage it, and have realized I just need to accept to live with it … but how does one do that? 
I am generally good at accepting it as “it is what it is”, but more and more often I catch myself living in a state of self-pity and feeling cheated; or like some curse or life in general is out to get me. I know it’s ridiculous, but I find it harder and harder to live with this disease. It holds me back from so many things in life, and it feels so incredibly unfair.

Are my inclinations and judgements completely up to me?,"From my observations I see that my mind can be in different states.  One of the dimensions is some kind of mental resource - ""a battery"". Depending on the ""battery"" level, the rational faculty operates more accurately and faster or less.  

The rational faculty requires thinking to withhold asent of impressions,  and  to critisize the judgement and believes. And active thinking is consuming a lot of energy.  

The level of the battery is affected by some factors:  the quality of sleep and physical health and activity,  by the food I eat,  by the cognitive load during the day,  etc. Those things are either preferred indifferenes or just indifferences,  and therefore not up to me. 

Does it mean that my inclinations and judgements are not always up to me?
 Maybe they're not really up to me when the"" battery"" is low? When the ""battery"" is low I might think not enough and less accurately, meaning I miss to recognize my inclinations and irrational judgements.

I surely can prioritize the rest and recovery to recharge the battery,  but at the same time I'd like to avoid getting into self-indulgence: postponing some tasks and decisions only because I ""decided"" (I judged) that the battery is low. Moreover, the circumstances sometimes require the best of our mental capabilities even when the battery is not full.

I am choosing not to use names or genders in this post. It has to do with my work. 

Context I work as an Aircraft Engineer, I gain a great deal of happiness in my career and have worked for many years to finish my masters degree in alternative engine design.  

Thursday a coworker was ""having a bad day"" although this seems to be a common occurrence with this individual. This person was yelling out about everything that is wrong, how they were the only one doing certain things, implying that the rest of us are lazy, incompetent, and in general being mental abusive The quote form Epictetus  ""Control what you can, cope with what you cant, and concentrate on what truly matters.""  kept me in line for most of the work day until the individual turned their attentions to me. Clearly my calm and the dedication to my work bothered them as myself and three others were the only ones not engaging in the hateful exchanges that were in the work place.

All of a sudden I was the primary target for this persons anger and rage. Nothing I was doing was correct, I was being unsafe, and I am stupid. I am aware of myself and although I'm Dyslexic I am by no means stupid. I could feel my anger and rage mounting and was about to engage with said individual when I was reminded ""The best revenge is to not be like your enemy."" I paused a moment and looked at the source of so much negativity in the work place, allowing my thought to settle I smiled saying 'What you have said is all very interesting and informative, I always seek to better myself and accept your point of view.' My coworker stopped clearly this person were expecting me to stand my ground and argue, or give a snappy retort as others had been doing all day. The appearance of cooky confidence that had been plastered across their face all day vanished in an instance, stuttering and mumbling ""well.. just do better."" That was the only response I got, still smiling 'I wish you a good life.' I replied my colleagues were shocked not believing that the terror had been delt with so effortlessly.

"The more I interact with people, the more I realize my flaws and disregard for safety. Help.","The more I interact with people the more I realize I lack some skills essential to survival and that's because of my unique circumstances.

I always wanted to be a high achiever. I have read and re-read all ancient stoic texts many times. I have a large number of friends. Yet I still think I have some basic and dangerous flaws, especially if I learn from my online interactions.

In person I believe I am a clear communicator, but when it comes to digital communication people straight up say I am a bad person. Where I come from, all my behaviors are normal and in fact I am less dangerous to myself than others.

But still I have made some bad decisions in my life, like the one time where I should have hired lawyers to protect me from corrupt anti-democratic officials from annoying me.

I was forced an overly academic life - despite that I have at least in theory excellent social skills and excellent understanding of overview of stoicism.

So I was wondering how to fix some basic flaws in me, right now. I always wanted to join special forces reserves, but if Reddit thinks (based on a limited text-only version of me, albeit) I am ""creepy"" or whatever, where the fuck has everything gone wrong so horribly?

I don't think anybody lives a perfect life. I always try to live virtuously and I am always trying to be the best version of myself, including in terms of

* Social connections
* Basic skills and abilities in all aspects of life, whether soft skills, hard skills or life skills.
* Time management
* Stoicism as a personal guidance philosophy.
* Working as a lawyer, pursuing an LLM after LLB, joining the army reserves after a shit ton of work on my health, keeping family happy, etc. are some of my goals.

But if based on my text, if Reddit people say I am not good enough... is it true? I don't think it is, although offline I do get shit also - they don't understand I am from a minority community.

[Here](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/06/racial-wealth-gap-may-be-a-key-to-other-inequities/) is a good introduction to ""wealth inequality"" by Harvard. Just posting it here for additional context.

Edit: In a developing country resources or services are not readily available. Judicial cases go on for like decades even for lawyers themselves (if the lawyer is the victim) and thus obviously I learned some irresponsible or grandiose stuff or did just plain wrong (like never hiring a lawyer - that's a recipe to be targeted by criminal groups) and only very recently I have been taking steps to ensure my protection.

This sounds like madness but what can you do. I have finally begin to look after myself and family, although I wouldn't say everything was my fault.",Stoicism,1705923861.0,t3_19ctscb,0.68,5
Seeking Practical Guidance in Meditations," Good day everyone,

I recently began exploring Marcus Aurelius' *Meditations*, and I've found it to be an insightful journey. While the wisdom within is profound, I'm grappling with the idea that some verses appear to be conventional rules that we encounter in various aspects of life. It raises the question: How can I apply these principles to navigate the complexities of everyday problems?

While it's evident what's generally considered good or bad, what I'm truly seeking is practical guidance on how to confront and handle the challenges that life throws our way. I'm eager to delve deeper into Marcus Aurelius' perspective on the application of stoicism in the real-world scenarios we encounter regularly.

For those who are in this path, how have you personally translated the Stoic principles from Meditaions into practical actions for daily problem-solving?

Does life being unfair justify us being unfair?,"I'm from Argentina, currently in my second year of university. Last year, my interest in politics and stoicism grew. I witnessed the injustices within politics and the university – instances where individuals lacking knowledge are hired due to connections with family and acquaintances.

Last night, I discussed these issues with my mother. In her job, many co-workers benefit from the privilege I mentioned earlier -working without having studied anything. She has witnessed corruption and theft committed by managers and coworkers.

To all this, she told me that she did not want the same thing that happened to her to happen to me; she struggles every month with financial problems, while those who take advantage of privileges, those who steal, those who are hired without ever making an effort in studying, they live comfortably without having to worry about their money.

For all this, she advised me to take advantage of any opportunity that appears. Because the others wont hesitate to take it.

I expressed to her that unlike those who took advantage of these privileges, she can be happy to get her money honestly and legally, to which she replied that no one takes from those people what they enjoyed with that money.

What would a stoic say to her? Do you think that in circumstances in which all people act unfairly, it is justified to act unfairly as well? Even if acting correctly means not being able to feed your family tomorrow?",Stoicism,1705881040.0,t3_19chnpl,0.89,59
Which philosopher said this and in which work?,"I'm sure it was some Stoic. Basically, he said (paraphrasing the author) that we shouldn't even be attached to our own lives.

To Just Do What's Right,"❄️️**Imagine** it’s a **cold winter morning** on a **Saturday.** You promised yourself that you’d wake up early, go the gym, go run, etc… You wake up; however, it’s cold.

*Too cold.*

🛌And you find that it’s warm under the blankets.

*Addictively warm.*

Instead of following through on the promise you made, you stay and keep sleeping… because the condition would worsen if you left.

Marcus Aurelius **felt** the same thing. He noticed that doing what’s right is hindered by our state of condition. But as a means of discipline, he outlined that, **regardless of our condition,** *we must keep going:*

&#x200B;

>**Just that you do the right thing. The rest doesn't matter. Cold or warm. Tired or well-rested. Despised or honored."" - Meditations (6.2)**

We must always do the right thing\*\*, especially\*\* and **most notably** when we are suffering or there’s a potential of suffering.

🚲 I have to bike 30km (18.6 miles) to school every other day. And while most days I am disciplined to get out of bed, *there are still those days that I wake up and struggle to throw my blanket off of me.*

""It's so nice and warm"" I tell myself.

It's a constant battle I have. And I'm sure other people have the same battle but in different circumstances. However, I always remind myself of this quote whenever I get up: ""I have to do what's right. I was born to do what I am doing now, so I should begin doing it."" And so should others; regardless of what you're doing, make sure it's the right thing.

The **state** of our human condition **should not** define what we decide to do and which promises we decide to break.

&#x200B;

Question about stoicism,"So, let’s imagine you are training for a job during a month. Interview come, but you didn’t get it.

« Not having a job » is not objectively bad, from the universe point of view. It’s only bad if you consider it being bad. And i saw several video saying « to see it as an opportunity to find a better job »

But…if staying unemployed was better, or gave you better career opportunities, why would you have trained then? If you prepared to get this job, that mean you considered being hired as a good thing no? Meaning not being hired is a bad one.

In other words, how do you mix the ideas some situations are better than others (to justify your efforts to reach them), with the idea you can consider any change of situation as neutral?",Stoicism,1705923696.0,t3_19ctqse,0.75,2
Love hurts like hell and I need advice from people,"I am seeking not only advice but needed some people to hear what I wanted to say, my story and such.

I have a girl best friend, and we have been friends for six years now, and have been best friends ever since, 2 years after being friends, she wanted to be my girlfriend, but I declined because I had just broken up with my past best friend, she got sad but we continued to be best friends, fast forward a few years later, she went to another country and we continued to be best friends, and we made a promise that if neither of us got someone, when we made thirty we would marry.

 I have seen some people do this but I really don't know where it's from, when I made the promise I wasnt thinking much about it, since she was in another country I really didn't care much, other than that, we are best friends right?

 Well, gentleman, life sure has some cursed humor, because when she came back for a little while, I was head over heels for her, and felt my heart hurt everytime we weren't near, all I could think about was her, she then went back to the country she is living, and I thought the feeling would pass, but oh well it didn't.

I am very emotional, and tried some stoic philosophy before, but my chest hurts a lot everytime I try to do this kinda of stuff, and well, I told her, told her that if needed I would wait for years if that meant she would wait for me, she told me that I shouldnt do that, tha I should live my life, she is right, I should.
Then I proceeded to not do that.
And now she has a boyfriend that she met a few months ago.

Now, why is this dumbass emotional man coming here to say all of this, I just needed to say, I saw this coming from a mile away, I'm not blind, she was getting distant, and we weren't really talking, more answering each other, I remember thinking of excuses, but we are practically adults now, life doesn't work like a fairytale, there isn't a princess waiting in the castle to marry for a promise we made years ago, even then, I convinced myself that it wouldn't happen, I heard it all, that this kind of promise is a backup plan, the so called Friendzone and things like that, and well, In the back of my mind I knew, so why does it hurt like hell over here? Is there some radical stoic way of thinking that won't hurt my chest everytime I think about someone I loved in the arms of another person? This is more of a rambling, I don't know how this community sees this kind of thing,

 I'm just asking for wisdom, a little push to grow as a person from people that are more experienced than me, so I'm being a little more vulnerable here, yes I'm happy for her it just hurts, thanks for your patience.",Stoicism,1705893960.0,t3_19cm15t,0.76,11

What drugs was Marcus Aurelius taking?,"Galen, his physician, says that Marcus Aurelius took a traditional remedy called *theriac*, which contained ""a grain"" of opium. We don't know what precise quantity this denotes, unfortunately, but Galen seems to be implying that it was a small amount.  Marcus complained that it was making him drowsy, so Galen reduced the dose further.  Some people have speculated that he was an addict.  I don't think the evidence supports that conclusion as use in very small doses, from what I gather, wouldn't necessarily lead to addiction, and the fact that Marcus requested a *reduction* in the does perhaps also speaks against it.

What's less well-known, perhaps, is that we're told several times in the Roman histories that when Marcus finally visited Athens he was initiated into the mysteries at nearby Eleusis, in a ceremony which entailed drinking a potion known as the *kykeon.*  In his bestseller, *The Immortality Key: The Secret History of the Religion with No Name*, Brian C. Muraresku collects evidence that suggests the *kykeon* contained ergot, cultivated for its hallucinogenic properties.  Marcus' trip to Eleusis seems to have been an important public event but it happened in 176 CE, which was probably after he'd finished writing the *Meditations*.

Incidentally, a bust of a Roman emperor, believed to be Marcus, was placed over the main gate of the Temple of Demeter at Eleusis.  It still exists there today ([photo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Cuirassed_bust_of_Marcus_Aurelius%2C_Eleusis_%2813945732075%29.jpg)).

Pests and roots cannot reach it, as it is independent of the physical world. Time does not weaken or strengthen it, only philosophy and commitment to the divine self can.

Dealing with my Breakup,"I have mostly been a person detached emotionally to concepts of relationship or having a girlfriend because of my first breakup .

There was a guy in our lives who basically was fellow classmate . he tried to talk to her and they started sharing reels and stuff , I was unbothered by it . But as she was my girlfriend he labelled her a slut infont of our peers for talking to her . for which I literally had a fight with him threaten him and they stopped talking.

I don’t know if I’m properly practicing stoicism,"I ask that because it feels like I’m only applying parts of the philosophy to my life, and stoics believe in constant practice or else you’re not a proper stoic 

I also don’t apply the temperance method to my life, where I’m constantly letting my pleasures get in the way of a proper routine, and I understand that this is a crucial step to fix 

I also believe in principles of pragmatism, materialism and existentialism 

Where one focus on the actions rather than the theory alone, be flexible with your environment, scientific explanations such as a person’s pre disposed biology and different results of chemical reactions in their brains but not in a sense of limitation as one can work hard/with different methods to achieve their goals (I assume that one can study other philosophies and not devote to only one) 

I honestly believe that the best way for a person to live their lives is to follow an above average lifestyle and have discipline with their actions, no one will strictly work out 9x a week for 6 hours straight and study the rest of the day and not sleep or eat nor will waste your life with mundane things, it’s always the best to find a middle ground, we are only human beings we are animals but we have logic and is this logic that gives us control over our raw emotions and desires such as understanding that you need to exercise and study but allow yourself the time to rest and enjoy life",Stoicism,1705872619.0,t3_19cedhc,0.57,1
Possible Cancer Diagnosis - How would stoics approach this?,"Hey all,

So recently I found a palpable lump in my chest just below my collarbone, and every day I feel some pain radiating from it.

I went to the doctor the other day, hoping that it would just be my hypochondria and to be sent off fine, but the doc confirmed that there is a lump there, and they took blood to find out if it is ""an accumulation of cells"", whether that be benign or malignant and so on.

I haven't got the blood test results back yet, and I have been emotionally very all over the place, going from feeling fine, to straight up crying for hours. To be honest, I am a bit scared.

I was wondering if anyone here knows how the stoics would approach such a situation, and if they could share some of that wisdom.

""It's hard to be a good person when no one is watching. But know that posterity always watches. When you understand that your body and belongings will be returned at some point, and together with your actions(the result of your thoughts) will be judged by posterity. Then you will always be motivated to do the right thing.""

Turning to you guys for help. Lost faith in life.,"Stoicism has helped me through many of my tough times but I’m out of it now, I’ve slipped into depression. 

This is why: I’m from a fairly lowly background and I dedicated my life to a career.  The idea was I would prove my worth by becoming successful through grit.  

Over the last few years:

One of my friends from a well-connected family got an offer from a friend - a connection.  He spent a lot of his life living like a playboy and now he’s leapfrogged me in career due to the network he has that I don’t. 

My other friend who didn’t graft like me is set in inherit money I would never dream of. 

My brother, who has spent a lot of his life avoiding hard work, has pushed a pretty weak medical negligence claim but will win more money than I’ll ever have and retire from it.  

My parents inherited all the family money and left nothing for us, spent it all on drugs and alcohol and on my brother.  

Now I am trapped working long hours in a hard career and I have less than all these people.  As I have to work hard my daughter is having issues in school.

The link between what I do and what I get is broken.  I’ve ended up with less than everyone but I did everything right.

I’m losing faith in life, everything.  I want to give up, it keeps happening. Everyone I know is ending up wealthy through fate and I’m stuck still with a mortgage, long hours etc. 

What was it all for?  I can’t stop as we will be impoverished.   Why did fate choose me to be the worker?  The other hilarious point is my earnings are taxed heavily but all their inheritance and claim is tax free, so I’m having to pay their taxes too. 

I know these are externals etc but I got to wake up at 5 every day and have health problems.  I got to have less time with kids. It’s not money, it’s my quality of life. 

I don’t have to be super rich and I don’t mind others good fortune but I feel like I’ve been conned.  It’s all mainly luck and God and fate seems to want to rub my nose in it.  It’s a good job I have kids otherwise after this happening so often I would want to check out of this corrupt and unfair world",Stoicism,1705813830.0,t3_19bvqaf,0.63,2

Years later,"Hi All, 28F looking for some advice here..

I grew up in a small town with a tight group of friends from elementary school through high school. Growing up, we were attached and all thought we’d be friends for the rest of our lives, in each others weddings etc. When we went off to college, we each went our separate ways, got jobs in different cities but stayed in contact thru social media, keeping each other up to date in a group message. At the time, I had gotten into a new relationship which eventually became toxic. I had made some new friends where I was studying/working and they knew about what was going on and what I was dealing with but I was so reluctant to tell my hometown friends about what I was going through.. I remember feeling embarrassed by the situation I was in. They all seemed happy and successful and I didn’t know how to communicate it. 3-4 months go by, (maybe more, I can’t remember exactly) where I don’t respond or update my life in this group message. One day I sign on and see that one of the girls removed me from the group. I remember a ton of emotions and at that time (6-7 years ago) I was still young and spite got over me, so I deleted all of my socia accounts which of course was wrong in hindsight. The first few months I felt pissed/angry and then as time went on, I felt an immense amount of guilt for never addressing it properly.  I’m at a point in my life where I know that we all moved on and that’s life, to accept it and I don’t feel as guilty as I did, considering no one reached out to me during one of the hardest times of my life to see how I was doing.

I want advice that I can use in the moment. Not just platitudes to repeat.,"I get nervous around people. Socially anxious. I know that I don't want to give my thoughts and time over to what I think others think of me (ofcourse, unless it is something that is right) because I know that it is not a good use of time.

Advice like ""life is too short for this"" and ""They don't think about you"", or ""You can't control their thoughts"", or ""It's all in your head"", are kind of useless when my reaction is automatic and my thoughts are buried in my subconsciousness.

I need some advice that I can try daily to combat my subconscious thoughts, and also in the moment. I need something that can change that automatic reaction.

Though I am aware of these thoughts in the moment, and even talk to myself in my head to reason with myself right at that moment I realise I am having these thoughts, I can't control the ""stiffness"" I feel when I feel as if they're staring at me, or judging me. I know all those aforementioned sentences are true, but they don't help at all during the moment, no matter how much I believe them to be true.

Am I doing this the right way? Does it just take some time to change these subconscious thoughts?",Stoicism,1705742403.0,t3_19b7xep,0.83,16

My feeling when I am unhappy in general,"Hello, dear friends! ❤️

I have very difficult situation..
I am unhappy now .. in everything..
I am confused und very tired emotionally in soul. 

A lot of different situations create responsibilities for me which I must to do. It is not fantasy, it is from reality. 
As example, to study German language every day from 7:30 - 16:30 on classic school in 14 faculties and after study it in integration course 17:00-19:15 Monday - Thursday.
After I have to do a lot of tests and exams in Bio/Chemie/History/German Literature/Ethik/Art/Informatik/Math/another subjects in school for grades minimum 4 - maximum 1-2. And I have to do general exam in B1 German from integration course in March.
And in Juni I have to do Exam from German History for integration.

In another side, I have to do a volunteer project in school because it is special  important program for to get grades for all students in 9 classes from 3 faculties - GRW, Deutsch, Ethik. It is a main responsibility inside school for everyone in 9 class.

And also I have to do a lot of homeworks in 14 faculties of school and in integration course. 

I have to go to doctors also at this time when I must to be in the lessons.

I have to send all documents for Jobcenter because of Bafög (Bafög is smaller for me then Burgergeld which I got earlier. I can not to pay for my flat by this money, and for food it is also not anough per month). I have to write in Email a lot about it for Jobcenter. I am tired also of it.

I have to have good grades in study. When grades will badly in study faculties or in exam of integration German, - in faculties I have to repeat 9 class once more, and in integration corse I have to pay new course to repeat last level of German language because it is new law which government of Germant created for Ukrainians in January 2024. It is a biggest stress.

In result...

I love in my heart English, study in English, work in profession in English (as a UI/UX Designer - 5 years, Front-End developer - 7 years). 
I love to paint illustrations in study materials also.
I love a lot to be as a mentor in developing software (have 2 years experience in this area).
But...
I can not to do it in Germany.. because they from government wanted from me to study German language and go to work which they want (not a developer, not a designer/illustrator). For designer/illustrator/developer in requirements for work in companies they need a lot of ""Ausbildung in Graphik/Kunst/Digital"" , ""B2 Deutsch"", ""Akademische Ausbildung"".
When I see it, I feel myself unhappy. 

I am cry today a lot when I opened German language book of integration because I have to do a lot of Homeworks of study it, and I really hate it now(o Got, I said it.. hope, the Germans will not hate me of this). 

Why I have to do things and processes in Germany which I don't like/hate/because another institutions want it?

I feel happy when I paint illustrations of study books/materials, when I teach development for somebody and believe in this person, when I see how my student goes to get win in study process and how he gets it with happy in his face, when I can develop software by myself, when I can do researchment and read / collect special data of research for create some functions in software.. 

But.. I can not to do it in Germany.. 
I have education in internet from Ukraine, not from Ausbildung in Deutschland.. it is not enough here for work and study, and study German language for my mind is more difficult as English.

I really love English with all my heart.. I also would like to teach English for German people as a teacher.. but this needs Uni/Studium of Teaching and special license of teaching (only according German standards of teaching)

When I understand this, I am cry once more..
I am confused.. 

What do you think, what will do in my place Aristoteles or Mark Aurelius?/or Kannt/ or Nicshe?

I am very grateful for your help..

Because today I am in a border of depression..
During all last week I had to take Krankenschein because I am very tired psychologically and physically.. 

I am grateful you 🙏

Jobcenter said in officially documents that they will pay my flat and medical insurance.

My biggest life mistake was wanting to live an easy life,"2023 summons this the best, I didn’t want to exercise, diet, barely studied, barely did anything useful, expected my friend to do all the work for me, procrastinated a lot by saying that “tomorrow I start to do this”, got addicted to porn, tried to be a people pleaser (even going against some of my own believes), etc 

I regressed a lot as a person and what  were my rewards for wanting to live an easy life basically in autopilot with no logic and following just pure emotions ? Anxiety, memory issues, suicidal thoughts, weight gain, burnout, a lot of extra final exams that almost cost me a full semester, almost lost some of my friendships, i got way behind my peers and didn’t get my driver’s license 

Growing up I was never pushed/expected to do great things, if I was average that was enough for my parents and me, my mom basically did my homework for me, I would eat and watch tv all day and not leave the apartment and no one would care, so I never developed discipline, sense of urgency and maturity 

I have my ups and downs but basically to this day I lack those core elements and the 4 stoic principles 

With no temperance no self discipline nor control so I will waste my days with pleasurable things and just “do the important things tomorrow”, even tho nothing guarantees me a tomorrow

With no wisdom no intelligence and resourcefulness making me have bad grades at my college and be afraid to treat patients (I’m learning to be a dentist but I don’t reread core concepts such as anesthesia so I just ask my friend to do all the work for me at the clinic)

With no courage no scape from my comfort zone so I don’t try to improve myself 

With no justice I abandon my principles of wanting to be a good man and focus only on pleasing people and not strengthening or even developing a sense of character 

I hope that this serves me as an experience of what living a shallow existence is and how to always try to be better than yourself from yesterday (even if it takes baby steps)",Stoicism,1705691126.0,t3_19aqv6w,0.97,180
This Stoicism quote is appropriate for today's distracted world.,"I recently read a quote by Marcus Aurelius that has been stuck in my brain ever since. The quote is full of insight and has benefited me greatly in several aspects of my life. I'd want to share the quote with you all.

**If you seek tranquility, do less. Or (more accurately) do what’s essential. Do less, better. Because most of what we do or say is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you’ll have more tranquility. But to eliminate the necessary actions, we need to eliminate unnecessary assumptions as well.  — Marcus Aurelius**",Stoicism,1705717908.0,t3_19b13qg,0.94,36
Is it my job to stop any injustices I see around me?,"I’ve been thinking about this for a long time and have struggled to find an answer. For example, you see an employee in your family’s company get verbally abused often. 

It isn’t an event happening under my control. So it isn’t my job specifically to get involved. Even if I did get involved, the preventing of one instance won’t change the person doing the harm. They will continue to harm people. 

But another rationale to even think about interfering is that I really want to to create an environment in my business where everyone is treated with dignity. But I am also young and haven’t been given the responsibility or ownership to the business yet and any involvement in advising family members would only make relationships worse. 

How would you make a rational decision when something so complicated comes up? And in general, is it your job to stop injustices, or just accept it and move on knowing that there is evil everywhere.",Stoicism,1705739111.0,t3_19b750f,0.8,9
Begin Again,"""Your principles can't be extinguished unless you snuff out the thoughts that feed them, for it's continually in your power to reignite new ones... It's possible to start living again! See things anew as you once did - that is how to restart life!"" -Marcus Aurelius

To practice this I can recommend daily 10 minute breathing meditations: try to concentrate yourself on the flow of your breath, from the beginning of the breath till the end of it. Once you reaize your focus has turned on to something else, such as thoughts occuring in your mind, just begin again with a fresh focus on your breath. And now do the same thing with your principles. After all, what is life without your principles to define your meaning?",Stoicism,1705742859.0,t3_19b817t,0.89,7
do I have to read the Introduction in meditations?,"I recently bought a copy of meditations from my local book store published by penguin and has a picture of a statue of Marcus Aurelius on the front. there is a rather lengthy introduction in the book by Diskin Clay and I dont feel as if I am getting much value from the introduction apart some history about Marcus. so am I able to just skip to the main part of the book labelled ""Meditations""?",Stoicism,1705794312.0,t3_19bphei,0.2,0

My classmates think i am a creep but i cant prove i am not,"I am an international student and i have history of anxiety and depression. I was on meds for an year two years ago. I came to Canada to do my masters. Initially it was all good but on one day while i was walking on a street, a random stranger was acting weird by coming in and out of my sight alternatively in both sides behind me. I fret and kept an eye on him and suddenly from behind he tried to attack me. I barely dodged it. I ran away quickly to place where many people were there. This incident has triggered me anxiety and panic. I never reported or did anything about this.

Now in my class, there was this girl who always sat infront of me diagonally. I never noticed earlier but she was always making sudden movements, looking back dont know why, this has triggered my anxiety and panic and hypervigilance. My mind would switch to fight or flight kind of mode. Even without my control i would keep tabs on her from corner of my eye. I try not to but my anxiety and panic mind could never be controlled. I think at some point she picked that im looking at her from corner of eye. I feel bad because of fearing what she might think of me. I changed my seating place finally. It was all good but even in my new place, another girl who sat triggered my anxiety due to her sudden movements. Its becoming tough to me, i changed places but i noticed that this girl is also staring at me occasionally and i feel atrociously bad for sending such signals. I never have any kind of feelings or anything like that. Now i suspect or think others are also picking on that i am kind of a creep staring at women etc. I am changing my places and avoided seating near women st all due to this fear but I cant control my anxiety as i always fear due to the aggression attack i faced two months back.

I am trying to get back on my meds and began practising mindfulness. I came to know im suffering from hyperawareness, sensorimeter ocd coupled with anxiety. Due to mindfulness.  Its getting better and i am  changing my places(i plan to stop this). But i hate being perceived as a creep but i guess i cant do anything about it.  I yell to myself that their opinions on me dont matter as i am stoic follower, but i am finding it hard getting out of it. I think im silently suffering. 

Sometimes truth is stranger than you think, i believe its true in my case. 

I dont want to share my medical history with any of my classmates although i shared it with my close friend whom i trust. I just wanted to let all this situation out of my chest as its too heavy",Stoicism,1705719260.0,t3_19b1jms,0.68,13
Birth of the Philosogrifters: How should we view them?,"The Philosogrifters mix up Epicurus with Epictetus. They propagate fake Stoic quotes without source.

By whom are the 4 basic stoic vritues that get so often quoted on here?,"I've read a bit Marc Aurel and some interpretations of Epictetus and those very never (as the ""cardinal virtues"") mentioned. Online (horrible source though) it seemed like the 4 virtues are by Zeno himself, but it didn't seem very legit at all.

Personally, it seems to me that people (on this sub as well) often use these as an easy way out (rather than an easy way into more stoicism) and oversimplify their world view by trying to follow them to the end. Of course i've seen them beeing mentioned, but only amongst other wisdoms (or ""virtues"" for the sake of it). All of them are mentioned countless times in meditations the interpretation of Epictetus i read, but never as THE BIG FOUR.

Maybe someone here has some bigger knowledge on that or maybe you know a sub (maybe history subs?) where this question may be more likely to get answered.",Stoicism,1705704626.0,t3_19aw8rp,0.81,21

Pleasant lie or Painful truth?,"I imagine its easy for stoics to say we prefer painful truths rather than unpleasant lies. Would you keep painful truth from your friends for the greater good? Can or should you live with it?

Lets say a bad deed or behaviour of your friends spouse is revealed to you. Would you expose the truth to the family of 3 children, and potentially ruin the lives of 5 people? As a flawed yet functioning family they are very happy, more productive and rich. Whats your course of action in the case?  

There could be many examples in modern politics and geopolitics but probably not allowed and easy to discuss.

Help with Stoic thinking over buying damaged external,"I can see where I’ve gone wrong already, in that I’ve been desiring an external for some time (a pair of nice sunglasses) and I finally bought them today.

However, they were damaged out of the box before I even got to wear them. (Didn't notice until I got home.)

Of course, I was flooded with anxiety and I let it ruin my whole day with value judgements over this being ""completely unfair"", ""the store won't help me"" that my sunglasses are ""ruined before I even got a chance to enjoy them"", and that ""I’m cursed as this always happens to me.""

I can’t seem to handle things not being perfect at the centre of all this. 

Anyway, how would a Stoic sage handle this?",Stoicism,1705739168.0,t3_19b75ji,0.6,1
How does one stop being so emotional?,"
Hello,

A few months ago, I stumbled upon stoicism, and I've been thoroughly enjoying immersing myself in its teachings and practicing to become a true stoic, striving to be the best version of myself. However, I find that I'm facing a challenge in effectively harnessing my emotions. I comprehend that the teachings emphasize the practice of refraining from expressing unnecessary emotions, but I'm particularly struggling with becoming less emotional, especially in my interactions with other people. How can one navigate the path to emotional restraint and cultivate a more stoic approach, particularly in interpersonal relationships?

Even though I have researched and tried to apply my findings of stoicism, I feel that the one thing I still struggle to control is my emotional decision-making.

It’s easy to say to yourself “stop being emotional,” but I find it’s counterintuitive, especially if you encounter situations that will strike an intense emotion.

I appreciate your feedback.",Stoicism,1705688478.0,t3_19apsri,0.88,12
Dealing with shitty neighbors.,"So I have these neighbors who are an absolute unit of dumbfuckery. My apartment has indoor hallways to get to the units and they consistently leave trash around for the cleaning lady to deal with. I'm talking zero regard for any kind of decency: throw up, fast food wrappings, melted chocolate (which really bothers me because of my dog.)
I'm struggling on how to deal with this the proper way and I'm trying to turn to stoicism, as I have in the past to try to find the best solution. I'm not too versed in stoicism besides the introductory readings, such as Aurelius and Epictetus, so any advice is much appreciated.
On one hand I can see the stoic belief being to make society better with what I can control i.e. helping the cleaning lady out picking up trash as I go and such.
However, as is the pattern with many shitty people this just reinforces the bad behavior. Stoics also seem to have an innate sense of justice and so how would I go about helping these individuals become better people so that the community is a better place? It might be petty but I've collected the trash and set it at their door before but having a conversation is not possible because of a language barrier. Front office will do nothing because there's never any direct evidence that but  in the building knows who it is. Thank you, in advance, for any insight.",Stoicism,1705705262.0,t3_19awhqb,0.73,5
What would be beneficial for Stoic Student Association?,"Hello fellow stoics, I'm reaching out today for some ideas/suggestions on various items for a budget that might be useful for a Stoicism club at my university. I have the privilege of being able to construct a budget where I request money for the upcoming fiscal year that should be used to further the mission statement of the organization, which is quoted as follows:

>The Stoic Student Association’s mission is to educate the public on the lessons of Stoic philosophy and encourage the practical application of the teachings of philosophers from the Hellenistic to Roman Empires and beyond. In one meeting, we aim to discuss a particular Stoic lesson by engaging in discussion, sharing thoughts and experiences, and molding the idea to work in the modern world. Anybody is welcome to learn more about these teachings and provide insightful conversation to all members of the club. Ultimately, these Stoic teachings were developed thousands of years ago, and therefore a very important process for all members will be deciding how to interpret and practice them in the modern era.

I have the following ideas so far:

* Books
* Merchandise
* Special Events

However, at the current moment I only believe that books are the best source of information and progression for the organization, as they directly fit the mission statement of educating the public and leading to more engaging and thoughtful discussion. For merchandise, I suppose I could spin it to encouraging members to practice the philosophy and have it fit in the mission statement, and for special events, I don't even know what that really could be but it just sounds cool. Ultimately in the future I would like to have a notable modern Stoic maybe on a virtual call with the club, but that would be likely in a few years and by that time I'll be out of uni and seems like a stretch for the first budget request

Does anyone have any other ideas on items I could request on the budget that would fit the mission statement? One additional note is that we are a relatively small club (15 people total, maybe 6/7 per meeting sometimes). 

Thanks in advance for any suggestions!",Stoicism,1705721063.0,t3_19b24xp,0.67,2

i recently got out of a toxic relationship and around the end of it i picked up stoicism and reading stoic works particularly meditations 

the thing I struggle with in this scenario is dealing with some strange feeling i cant identify i deal with jealousy and while that was something i ignored in the relationship now that i ended things i feel guilty for worrying about who she may or may not be with. its a struggle just to be in the same room as her i have been able to manage my emotional reaction and not make rash decisions based on my feelings but the struggle i face is internal i understand that stoicism is not the practice of not feeling emotions but i do wish there was a way to temper my internal monologue a bit especially when i hear or see things that make me over think. i don't struggle with dealing with an external reaction at all i just struggle with being stoically minded particularly in the sense of what i do and do not control i want to be able to be at peace and happy knowing that she and her actions are not in my control and that it doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things one quote in particular ""we often struggle more in imagination then in reality"" comes to mind and im looking for any advice that might pertain to gaining the ability to be at peace internally and not just externally ",Stoicism,1705713098.0,t3_19azgto,0.4,0

I know a lot of people in the world might say that if you want meaning or purpose in your life you need a respectable goal. Which, on the surface, I can understand. 

My concern is that...what does it mean if you can't? What if you fail? We're all prone to do so. What if other obligations come along and you have to give up your dreams? What if you become disabled? What if you straight up die the very day you decide on a goal? 

I'm not saying that if someone is dreaming of being an astronaut they should just give up. But should our goals be where we find meaning and contentment?

Today I will begin a path of gratitude,"4 years ago, coming out of high school. I experienced mental struggles that changed myself and the way I view life. For over a year, I struggled with severe depression and anxiety. While it did get a bit better, these mental issues underlied my time in college. They were related to regret, guilt, and insecurity.

4 years later in the present. I'm honestly in a position I never thought I'd be in. I've gained a lot of personal confidence, lost social anxiety, have a great girlfriend, and will be starting a job after college making more money than I could ever imagine.

But still, lately I've found myself more low than normal. Starting to spiral down into some of my old thoughts. Which are triggered by specific things that I won't get into. These past years, I don't think i've ever truly felt peaceful and free, at best I could push my thoughts away and try to ignore them. 

4 years of overthinking, dark thoughts, self-doubt, anxiety, closing myself off to others. What did I gain from that? Nothing at all. Just lost time.

Today I will try to being a path of gratitude and perspective. I cannot base my happiness on my current situation. I need to appreciate everyday as it is, not regretting the past or worrying about the future. I need to focus my energy into the things I can improve on and control, my work, the gym, building friendships, my relationships etc.

"What would be the Stoic approach to dating and finding love? Is it even worth me, as a man, trying my hand at dating?","Long story short: I’m 28 years old and have never been on a date, and thus never been in a relationship. I’ve never known love outside of that given by my parents. And I also never had friends growing up and thus spent the majority of my life alone. That was until recently when I finally managed to acquire two genuine friends. 

To put it simply, I’m lonely. I feel an emptiness inside me that no amount of Lexapro (antidepressant medication) can seem to fix. I want the feeling of waking up next to someone I love and feeling genuinely happy. But I also know how hard it is for men in our day and age to find romance/love and how dating apps can be like bottomless pits of swiping over and over again, just hoping and praying one girl out of 100 will match with you. But even then, there’s a good chance she’ll ghost you just because. It all seems so hopeless. 

But, I also know the Stoics would say things like “Your happiness should not be dependent on the people in your life and the value you place on them”. And I just don’t know how to reconcile the Stoic philosophy and finding true inner peace and tranquility with my desires I want out of life and not wanting to be lonely anymore.",Stoicism,1705586183.0,t3_199qp1t,0.88,49

I need a stoic solution on how to deal with an issue in my relationship.,"Hi, my (F30) husband (M32) have different levels of affection whereby I am more affectionate and love spending quality time, hugs, kisses, asking about his day etc whereas this doesn't seem to occur to him naturally. Therefore I always feel deprived of affection and acknowledgement very often. It's as simple as not being acknowledged when I walk into the house after a workday, barely even looks in my direction and I have to initiate a Hi let alone a kiss. When I initiate he does respond but this is wearing on me since it would be nice to have that without asking for it. I have expressed this multiple times but he changes for awhile and goes back to old patterns soon after. I'm beginning to grow resentful especially because this last week and part of this week I have really struggled mentally and would have loved a genuine ""How was your day today?"". I would also love hearing ""I love you"" without having to say it first. So I decided to mirror his behaviour and not Initiate any of my usual affection and conversation, we've been quiet for 2 days. I wonder if I should focus on controlling my own actions as recommended by stoicism and maybe seek the affection elsewhere? Or maybe not give affection either so that I don't feel short changed and hence protect my peace of mind. His family is the same way, naturally dull and cold and have an almost professional relationship unlike mine that is very much affectionate hence my personality.

What’s the point,"Hey everyone. I got into stoicism about a year ago while I was having some family problems and the philosophy helped me get through those times. 

Because of Marcus Aurelius I started reflecting on my death a lot more. Originally this was helpful as it helped me put a lot of things into perspective. I realised how temporary my problems were.

However I’ve been thinking about death almost all the time for the past few weeks to the point where I don’t see the point in most things. I’m in college and used to be really focussed on my career and working out but now I feel like why should I bother being the best version of myself or strive towards being virtuous if it’s so temporary. Does it matter if I live according to my nature if I’m gonna be dead anyway? The advice I’ve gotten is to be good for the people around me but even their lives seem so temporary. The idea that humans exist for each other seems like a chicken and egg problem. Ironically the more Momento Mori i do the more anxious I feel. 

Could really use some advice. Thanks everyone",Stoicism,1705576056.0,t3_199npwf,0.8,11

"I do not recommend ""How to be a Stoic"" by Massimo Pigliucci","When I started this book, I expected a philosophical manual on Stoicism, at the end of a most underwhelming read however, what was delivered was a poorly written and thinly disguised self-help book.

&#x200B;

It started out decently enough though, a brief history of the philosophy, followed by an examination of its main tenets. All the good in it was contained in the first 20% and even then there were traces of the navel-gazing to come. Everything after... shockingly poor.

&#x200B;

Never have I seen an author miss the mark so much. The decision to write this in first-person only served to show how flawed the author is, all of his biases and prejudices were laid bare. A better title for this book should have been ""How to be Massimo Pigliucci"", every chapter was littered with entirely boring and braggadocios anecdotes of a man who evidently thinks himself an embodiment of humility, modesty and fine character. You would see interesting chapter titles that ended up being neither informative or thought-provoking, for someone who never missed the opportunity to tell the reader how non-religious he is, the whole book had an air of boring preachiness about it.

Practical advice to not dwell/feel guilt on past mistakes/regret,"When you make mistakes, big ones. Ones that might change the trajectory of your life. It's hard not to dwell on them.

It's very easy for me spiral into overthinking mistakes. Part of it is due to my perfectionist personality. The past few years for me have been rough to say the least. At times very low, but at times I felt happy and found joy in life.

Like I said, I often spiral into deep places of guilt at what I've done, anger at myself, anxiety towards the future, and so much regret that I just feel hopeless towards life. How can I help myself when this is happening.

Some things I try to tell myself.

\- Comparison is useless, I will always hurt myself looking for what I lack in others.

\- The only good a mistake can serve is a lesson, other than that it's just needless suffering

\- If my mistake does cost me now or in the future, than that is something I have to deal with, suffering in my mind is just extra punishment",Stoicism,1705552475.0,t3_199hmtv,0.87,16

Stoicism is incredible !,"Hey friends, I didn't imagine that a philosophy could impact me so much in such a short amount of time. It's just incredible.

I discovered Stoicism recently, and to be honest, I didn't believe much in the effect. Out of curiosity, I started delving deeper, and just wow, it resonated so much with me and really improved my mind. I found peace with myself. The idea that life is about balance; I found that controlling your actions is not achieved by fighting your emotions, but by accepting your emotions at their fullest and letting them express inside you. Little by little, I began to feel a kind of moment where you face your mind, and you see your feelings taking over.

"'[...] Certainly it has made the inferior in the interests of the superior and has connected the superior one with another.

Adding:

'[...] For it has been proved long ago that we are born for fellowship; or was it not plain that the inferior creatures are in the interests of the superior, the superior of one another? But the animate are superior to the inanimate and the reasoning to the merely animate.' (Book 5, Paragraph 16, Meditations)

-----------------------------------------------------------

Hey, this quote(s) left a big questionmark on my mind, so I'm here for some input to understand them correctly. I conclude I've got more then one question to ask as they built up on each other.

(1) It translates to me that the old stoics distinguish between valuable and less valuable people.

(2) If my first impression (1) is right, why do high valuable people and superior only be the interest of likewise people and the inferiorjust existng just for the earlier mentioned? Why is the superior not helping the inferior to rise or at least show a new way of being and try to practice it? It seems that inferiors are only in the equation to look up to the rational ones (At first without judging it, just what it seems objektive. Later on it seems arrogant.).

I guess it's the distinguish between people who serve stoicism no matter what stage there on and the other people. A second or more detailed guess is that they distinguish between those who think, act and behave for the community/social mind and those who lay on them because they don't bring something valuable into it.
(3) Am I even close with my guesses?


From actually looking in our society we indeed have people who think, act, behave, yeah work and live for the society and e.g. others who can't or simply don't bring that much value into it and need to rely on others help, get cure or a financial minimum (at least to live) etc. We could see them as 'less valuable' because of the different input we all put in the big pot. Also thinking of disabiltys some people experience. But everybody is gifted individually and although I see those more- or less-'valuable' people in society, I wouldn't morality-wise treat them less respectful or think of them like less of a human being. Indeed it is humanly.

I slightly remember (might remember wrong) that Seneca said that as a stoic and aiming for getting wise you need to sort of break contact with those who aren't on the same path. Like choosing not to deal with them.

Please correct me if wrong or missing anything.)

What are some actionable steps to practice Stoicism?,"Recently I've been making a planned effort to study philosophy everyday, where previously I'd just passively consume information as my Youtube and Reddit algorithms put it in front of me. 

I've been primarily reading about Buddhism, and some Taoism as well. What I like about Buddhism, is that it is very clear about the steps you must go through in order to attain enlightenment. You must follow the Eightfold Path in order to attain enlightenment, and each step has very clear instructions. 

For example, Step 1 is to understand the Four Noble Truths, Step 2 is to internalize them and allow wholesome actions to naturally flow forth. Steps 3,4, and 5 precisely tell you what actions are wholesome or unwholesome and clear up any gray areas. Step 6 instructs you how to remove the 5 Hindrances (mindsets that hold you back from enlightenment), and cultivate the 7 factors of awakening (positive mental states). I haven't gotten to steps 7 and 8 in my studies yet, as step 6 is very dense with information. I'm getting this information via Ajahn Sona from this playlist of videos https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCXN1GlAupG0_DzIOFNrDSp0fTwTLkTxV&si=fiBpd9SM2c4m8XRA

I was wondering if Stoicism had similar actionable steps. I'm familiar with Memento Mori and the following quote from Meditations:

""[2.1] When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they cannot tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me.""

I was wondering if you know of any other actionable steps that can be taken in Stoicism, like there is in Buddhism. 

Also, from what I understand, Stoicism seems to be a reactionary philosophy. It seems to suggest waiting until something offends us, then rationally choosing a reaction during the time between stimulus and response. Buddhism seems to be more proactive however, allowing me to exert energy in order to remove the 5 hindrances, and giving me a task of cultivating healthy mental states via the process of meditation and mindfulness/metacognition. What do you think about this interpretation?

I made a very similar post in the /r/Taoism if you'd be inclined to see their responses. I enjoy learning about Buddhism, Taoism, and Stoicism; they seem to have a lot of overlap.

Example of daily Journaling,"Today at the grocery someone was backing out of a spot. I didn't see them until I was already behind them. I just kept driving because legally I had the right away. They laid on their horn. Now I didnt get mad and I didn't get worked up. I did get out of the car after parking knowing that they were about to drive past. I didn't want to seem like I was hiding or avoiding them as im trying to become more comfortable facing conflict, this is something ive struggled with my entire life. I also got out with a smile waved and started to say sorry. But the guy cut me off with some attitude ""boy you don't know how to drive do you"" (SO MEAN RIGHT?!🤣) here is were I lost sight. I got a annoyed and said something about how I was going to apologize but if he wants to be an ass we can be assholes. I could of just said. You know what man. Im sorry. In my defense me and my wife were talking about how she is currently having a miscarriage and I haven't really had a chance to grief and process the loss. So my emotions might of been a little off. 

In this situation there are a few things I could of done better. 1. Not let his comment annoy me into getting into a play ground argument. If he's not physically coming at me there is no reason to engage and 'save face'. Just apologize and move on with life.
2. I got a little bit of an adrenaline dump from arguing with him. This tells me I was looking into the future and the possibility of a fight from having words with him. If words are to be had then have them and be in that moment at that time and only get ready for a fight if a fight is about to happen. ""I have to die. If it is now, well then I'll die now. If it is later then now I will take my lunch"" 
3. After I walked away and into the store I was still worked up and it took some time to really come down and let go. I was still replaying the moment in my head. But not in a ""could I have done that better way"" in a ""I could of said this, that dude was such an asshole, I would of kicked that dudes ass"" way.  In this moment I was ""suffering more in my mind then in reality""

"Facing your fears, trauma's and pain. How does one do it?","I'm kinda new in the world of Stoicism and spirituality. I'm trying to improve myself and to process my past to be able to grow. My past has a lot of darkness and pain. Mostly caused by trauma's or other stuff I've been through.   


How does someone be able to face his fears, darkness, trauma's and mostly the pain inside of oneself?  I truly don't know where or how to start and what i need to do to be on my journey of facing them. I don't want to live in pain anymore or having to use alcohol or social media to numb it.

How to remain indifferent to loss?,"How can we actually put this Stoic teaching into practice, simply not caring if all things are destroyed, including close relatives and friends? Since humanity tends towards the desire for preservation, not suffering from losses is a practice quite distant from most people.

He is going to say i cheated. But i didnt. I really didnt  and theres no proof i did. The extra tab i had open was instagram. He never outright said i was but he made me say it. He asked me ""what does this look like to you"" and i said ""cheating"" anyways i was humiliated. Now all she knows about me after us not talking for about a year now is that i cheated on a test.

"Hell, Camus, and the Ancient Stoics","I have a thought experiment and a question for y'all. 

**(The setup)**

Imagine that on the Day of Judgement, God, the Christian god, banishes the ancient Stoics to Hell. 

There are many Christian views on Hell, but let's suppose this Hell is an *inescapable*, *eternal* stream of *torment*. 

I know there are many Christians on this sub. Out of respect for their faith, let's not argue but simply suppose that the Ancient Stoics come to the conclusion that the Christian God is unjustful and thus not worthy of worship. Their claim is that an inescapable, eternal stream of torment is unjustifiable and inappropriate for punishment for whatever ""sins"" they committed in their finite lifetimes. If humans can forgive their persuctors, they reason, then surely the ""all loving"" Christian God can forgive. And if humans have the instinct to correct, rather than just punish, bad behavior , surely the ""all loving"" Christian God would eventual seize the torment so that people could reintegrate back into a relationship with God. 

**(The question)**

What attitude would the Ancient Stoics take in Hell? How would they handle themselves in Hell?

To be clear, this is just speculation. I speculate the Stoics would forgive the Christian God. I would imagine them like Camus said of Sisyphus:  *One must imagine Sisyphus happy*

And I would even imagine Epictutus whispering to himself:

> To incarceration. Do I have to complain about it? To exile. Is there anyone stopping me from going with a smile, joyful and content? ... **You'll shackle my leg, but not even Zeus can conquer my will.** 'I'll throw you in prison. My body. 'I'll cut off your head? Well, have you ever heard me suggest that I'm unique in having a non-detachable head?

How to turn an obstacle into an opportunity?,"I am struggling to find the opportunity in the obstacle. This is where I call upon your help. Please be gentle, I am a sad raccoon 🦝

Three years ago, I lost my job caring for a sick previously estranged family member (dementia and alcoholism-based physical complications). I had no support from anyone so I fell into debt paying bills and rent and groceries. One family member stepped in, making all sorts of  allegations and being outright abusive in a bid to get total control of my dad's finances. I was proven innocent again and again, but nonetheless it all took a terrible mental toll and I eventually had to step back for my own health.  The whole situation lasted around three years and every moment was awful. I managed to find another job within a few months of losing my last, which I dislike and pays badly.

I'm trying to move past it all but with the debt at £12,000 (I pay it down and it just gets bigger every year at 47% interest) I'm finding it hard. I've been job hunting for a better salary to outpace the interest as I'm currently underpaid where I am but I've had terrible luck. 

I was offered one job after around seven interviews, for example, then the offer was rescinded because the company decided to freeze all hiring. Situations like this have happened repeatedly, where I'm unsure how my actions could have created a better outcome and I'm doing everything ""right"" on the surface. I have given up on job hunting for now and am trying to accept and be grateful for the job I do have.

This has increased the sense of desperation, as the job I lost caring for my father was awesome and paid well, and I feel like I'm not going to be able to get back to that again. This increases my resentment towards the situation, like it's a reminder how many steps back it's pushed me.  

I am also very physically unwell, recovering from three years worth of burnout, but I cannot take any significant amount of time off because my company does not pay sick pay. In fact, they threatened to fire me if I took more than a fortnight off. I exercise a lot, take medication and eat healthily but am so very, very weary and generally sad all the time. 

I am also unable to get the medication that would help my newly diagnosed disability, which apparently compounded the stress of caring for my dad, due to a long waiting list in my country's healthcare system. 

I think about all I did caring for my dad, all the things I fixed for him, like chasing down scammers to get back money and using that to organise his care, and how it helped him and the family member that savagely betrayed me but just set me back so far. 

What opportunity can I find in this adversity? 

I regret doing it. My dad abandoned me as a child and it was foolish of me to help him.  My friends say I should be proud of helping him when he was so terrible to me but I don't really see what the virtue in that is. I mostly feel stupid. I'm struggling to see what I can learn from this or how it has been anything other than a a series of cruel circumstances drawn yet again from having an abusive, screwed up family. Other than, maybe, I should have just left him to die. But that doesn't feel right at all. But perhaps it is? Perhaps that is the opportunity? Or is just plain acceptance the way forward? 

So please, help me find the silver lining, the opportunity in the obstacle, so to speak. I feel that if I can extract meaning from it I can move in. It's been a year since I stepped back from the majority of my duties, and I still cause myself suffering over it all the time. 

I'd like to cultivate peace and moving on from it rather than the daily resentment, grief, self-hatred and desperation. I know some of this is my C-PTSD and how it all triggered a lot of trauma, but a lot, honestly, feels spiritual and mental, like I can't make my world right after it.

I've been practising Stoicism alongside general philosophy and meditation for awhile. I also go to weekly therapy and exercise for up to two hours daily for fitness and anger processing.

Scary lawyer letter,"Everyone probably heard about these letters, knows someone who received them, or received them themselves. Lawyers keep sending these letters because they are effective. People get scared and pay even if they have no obligation. For example, in some countries, media companies hire lawyers to send these letters to people who pirate movies, demanding payment to avoid a lawsuit.

From a Stoic perspective, these letters are ink on paper - nothing more. It's up to you to decide what you think and what you do. If you feel anxious, the letter is not causing it. It's your brain that is taking the bait. 

I never cared about these letters, but it's always a few days of drama when a household member picks them up from a mailbox. Since they don't understand the law, they already imagine someone coming to our house and taking possession of our household items because of ""debt"" or me ending up in jail for years.

SouthAsian Narc mother causing me issues that directly impact my life and beyond my control. How to proceed?,"My SouthAsian narc mother is making my life hell from far away in another country.

The only thing I can do is NOT stress out and fix MY things where she breaks them. This caused me to start over multiple times.  

Problem: Now she is spreading rumours about me and my partner about me being abused by him. Solution - we can ignore it as it does not impact my life directly. 

Problem: She is calling me every moment, bombarding me with messages which is literally causing me to physically hyperventilate and increased blood pressure. Solution - i can block them on phone after writing a short message not to call me so that they don't think I am dead.  

Problem: She may come to my place unannounced and me being unprepared. Now this does directly impact me. I do not know how to deal with this if she suddenly appears at my door.

An Unorthodox Method To Deal With Anxiety,"In this post, I will present what I consider to be an unorthodox method of dealing with anxiety and what I will dare to call, anxious thinking. 

**Cause**

It is possible that, at this moment, you are going through a particularly tense, difficult, or painful situation in your life and think that your anxiety is the direct, natural consequence of events in your social, family, or work environment.

However, the cause of your anxiety is not found in what you are currently experiencing; instead, it lies in the future that you believe you will have to face. Your mind is filled with repetitive thoughts about imaginary scenarios in which that catastrophic future will occur.

What causes your anxiety is not a specific situation you are experiencing but the imagination of something much worse, which your mind categorically classifies as unbearable.

**The Method**

How to deal, then, with anxious thinking? How to overcome chaotic, repetitive thoughts in an imaginary scenario that torments us? The method I propose is to imagine the worst, to think about the scenario that torments you.

I dare to classify this method as unorthodox because it goes against what we intuitively would like to do to avoid anxiety: avoid thinking about what we fear. However, analogues of this method can be found even in various ancient philosophies, among which Stoicism is no exception.

The idea is to observe the same imaginary scenarios that generate anxiety, but really analyze them, view them as another possible option calmly, rather than as an event that will inevitably occur in a way that is categorically incompatible with our existence. The reason these thoughts obsessively cause us anxiety is that our mind unquestionably classifies them as unbearable.

Likewise, just thinking about them calmly is a very powerful weapon to drive away anxiety. We must remember that, evolutionarily, the goal of these repetitive thoughts is to prepare us for plausible future scenarios and obtain useful intuitions about how to act in response to them.

However, individuals experiencing anxious thinking are unable to use imagination as a source of knowledge, only as a source of fear. When possible worrying scenarios appear in their minds, the anxious individual gets stuck in them, going round and round through chaotic, repetitive thoughts.

But if, following the original evolutionary objective of these thoughts, we delve into the imagination of possible solutions, our thoughts will not generate the same anxiety. By doing this, we put ourselves in a situation where we internalize them as past events that have already occurred.

Seeing them through this key is much simpler because it is not difficult to face a past situation, which, like any other, is just a fact against which we will have to act.",Stoicism,1705424826.0,t3_1987x3d,0.91,9
Emotions,"Suppressing immediate emotions in order to process and make sense of them. 

For some, it takes some time to go through that processing stage and that can certainly frustrate those expecting that immediate emotional response/feedback…where it may be warranted. 

I recently had a conversation with an individual who asked if those raw emotions get watered down the longer one takes to process them.  I keep thinking about this and I guess in a way they could/do. 

I’m not entirely sure how to word this question, but I guess I’m hoping to hear how people practicing stoicism respond/react to others with that initial raw emotion in a logical manner.

Brother is obsessed with Andrew Tate,"My brother, a 17 year old, lives by Andrew Tate’s “philosophy” as if it were the law. 

I didn’t know anything about him until I started to get into the root cause of my brother’s behavior. 

It’s a complete bastardization of stoicism. Just unbelievable how selfish his behavior has become. 

He shows no respect for our father, who is elderly now. No respect for anyone other than himself. I’m not going to go into details because it’s a long list. 

After briefly reviewing some of the Tate “ideologies,” I’ve come to realize justice is an afterthought. 

Yes, I know. He’s a 17 year old boy. 17 year olds are selfish. I was at one point. However, it seems out of control now and I don’t know how to mentor him properly. 

I’m 33. He’s my half brother. Father is a single parent with 3 other half brothers to look out for. Very clear he received minimal discipline. 

I try my best to mentor the boys because my father needs the help. 

I’ve been away in the army for the better part of the 17 year olds life. I’m not worried, I don’t fear the outcome. I know it’s his choice. However, while he’s still in the house, I would like to make an impact because it’s very apparent that it will cause him hardship when he’s moved out. 

This kid is the “cock of the walk.”

Here’s a brief description. 

17 years old, 6’4”, 250 lbs, all state football, Jock, Smart. He proclaims he’s the Alpha of the school. I cringe just typing that sentence. 

Any advice welcome.




Edit: I see why people would construe my words as jealousy. I said I wasn’t going to go into the details because it’s a long list, here’s a recent example. 

Last month he stole one of my father’s credit cards and spent $3500 in 20 days before we saw the statement. He was going out and taking friends to nice dinners, Uber eats to school for lunch, bought a membership to a health club, buying clothes he didn’t need…

When confronted by my Father, he showed no remorse by saying he simply “needed money.” The only thing I’ve said to him was, “I’m disappointed in your actions.” He avoids me like the plague now.

As for the reason I bring up his physical attributes. My father is elderly. He can barely walk. He simply cannot discipline him due to my brothers size and mentality. It literally becomes a shoving match with my father ending up on the floor. It’s just a bad situation.",Stoicism,1705339910.0,t3_197efd1,0.91,465

I'm sitting at home, crying because I just see no light at the end of the tunnel.

I'm a very upbeat person. Always trying to see the positive. But I feel so helpless here.

​

I'm a 31 year old, (otherwise) fit male.

​

Every day I find myself anxious or uncomfortable about the most mundane things.

Sitting on the subway. Driving a car. Walking. I lost my ability to relax.

​

I constantly feel my hems and they get worse during the day. Every evening I wish

my life was different. I envy every person that doesn't have to deal with this.

I love to do a lot of sports. Now I'm too scared to do hard exercise.

I don't do any activity that could lead to worse Hemis (bouldern, skiing, running, lifting). I love to do all of those things.

​

I do everything in the book that should help or prevent them.

Eat a lot of fiber, drink enough water, NEVER EVER STRAIN. Nothing helps.

​

My therapy so far:

​

Got hemorrhoids in early 2021. Got first banding in August 2021.

Got another banding. Got sclerotherapy. Got Raphaelo radiofrequency treatment.

Tried alternative healing as well (TCM etc.)

​

They were Grade 2. Now grade one, but there is still CONSTANT pressure on my fucking anus.

​

I also hate thinking about them so much. But I can't help it. It's almost an intrusive thought at this point to think about them. Even they are ""only"" grade 1 atm I can feel them every day, all the time.

​

Sometimes I have the thought, that my intrusive thinking about them makes them worse or that they would go away with me doing it. But it's impossible not to think about them. And they are connected to so much anxiety and shame. It's such a downward spiral thought process as well.

​

I want to know if I can get rid of them again in my life. But all the posts about surgery also seem horrible. And I'm not sure you could do that for grade 1-2 hemorrhoids.

I don't want to lose hope that my body can regain balance.

​

I just wanted to post it here because I had to get it out of my head.....

​

Thank you for reading.

I’m having a hard time following the temperance virtue.,"I’m 24 years old and still don’t have self control over my pleasures, I binge eat like an animal, spend my time on YouTube and masturbate over 5x a day 

I’ve tried many different medications to control my binge eating problem because I’m obese and pre diabetic with different results, I’ve tried to record on an app what I eat to watch my calorie intake and even slapped my face every time that I felt that an episode of binge eating was coming, but nothing worked for too long 

I’ve unsubscribed from every porn related subreddit and deleted my safari history so whenever I google something it will not appear but it did not work for too long either

The same with my YouTube I try to distract myself with other things such as books and movies just to have a better sense of time expended per entertainment, I can finish 1-2 chapters or watch a movie in 1-2 hours each and have the rest of my day off instead of watching multiple videos of 50 minutes a day 

But again nothing works for too long, my brains is in a vicious cycle of dopamine “if something is not giving me immediate dopamine then I will get in autopilot and screw your productivity”

How To Approach Feelings Of Frustration,"In Meditations, Marcus Aurelius states. “Don’t be overheard complaining… Not even to yourself.” My question is how does one express frustration or opinion in a Stoic manner in order to help the community? I had dealt with a conversation today regarding the competence of the higher ups in our union and was trying to figure out how to express my opinion without necessarily ‘complaining’.",Stoicism,1705448835.0,t3_198hvg5,0.5,0
I took a beating during a drunken fight,"A guy and I got confrontational at a party (we were drunk) and at some point when i stood with my back to him he basically jumped me. He hit me a couple times in the back of my head until someone dragged him away. I walked away from the situation, but now i feel like i should have retaliated. My ego took a bigger hit than by body, i’m only a little sore no bruises or anything.",Stoicism,1705405475.0,t3_19810vf,0.59,6
Irony in morning meditation," Recently,  I stumbled upon stoicism by reading a couple books. I've struggled through much of my life looking for philosophy that matches what I believe. Stoicism feels like something I can really get behind. From my perspective there are a lot of truths to it. So I'm pretty excited to be apart of it and the community.

The reason I'm writing this post is to share my new experience. While reading has been a pleasure, I'm finding the actual practice difficult. Today was a perfect example. I spent so much time angry at every little life nuisance. While walking my dogs I was angry about the traffic and other people trying to use the sidewalk. I was acting surly. I've used Marcus Aurelious 's morning meditation to help deal with co workers and other people who stress me out. Yet I turn around and act the same way they do. In a sense it's kind of funny. Like going from hero to villain. What a fucking hypocrite. 

Anyway I just wanted to share and reflect on this experience. I hope everyone's journey through life is going well. Cheers.",Stoicism,1705369251.0,t3_197qhus,0.95,20
How do I have more patience with my mother ?,"I’m sorry to use internet terms but, she’s a Karen, There’s no better way to tell it

She’s always talking loudly, complaining about everything, treating her own mom like garbage, always fat shaming me, she doesn’t accept that I’m bisexual (I had to break up with a great guy because of her), she’s a hypocrite, an alcoholic, she doesn’t listen to my arguments, she never listens to me, she makes it super clear that she wanted another son who would follow everything that she wants, everything needs to be her way, she doesn’t respect my boundaries and limitations, is always calling me weird even tho my psychiatrist told to her face that’s likely that I’m on the autistic spectrum, she’s always hammering in that I didn’t get my driver’s license after failing the exam for the first time, she doesn’t want to pay for my medications, she forced me to go to a college that I don’t like (she literally matriculated me there without my consent), she’s always doing things behind my back and telling me moments prior until the event happens, making me super anxious, she thinks that I’m faking being depressed and anxious….

Next year I’m graduating from college and I will be able to live my own life but I still need to get through this year 

I really didn’t want to feel this way about her, none of my friends have issues with their parents, and I do t like to hold grudges against anyone, not even those who hurt me, Marco Aurelius told that people are meant to cooperate with one another and that hate and rivalry are unnatural but I’m tired of trying to change her",Stoicism,1705417677.0,t3_19850pr,0.45,0
I just failed a class and I don't know how to tell my father,"I thought that the matter had a solution and I took it as calmly as possible, there were several alternatives to avoid losing an entire semester of time in the failed class. but nothing works and I will have to spend more time pursuing my degree because I failed this class.

I have no problems with this, I accept it, I was always a wonderful student and although it affected me at first I already understood that a grade does not determine my value as a person, the problem is with my father, he is a very complicated man with grades, It's the only thing he's ever asked of me in life and I don't know how to tell him, on the one hand shame invades me and on the other hand I know he's going to be extremely angry.

I don't know how to sit down and talk to him, this is my only and biggest problem at the moment regarding this thing that bothers me so much, any suggestion or advice I would receive with great gratitude.",Stoicism,1705363317.0,t3_197ob1b,0.86,16
"I feel like I'm in an endless rut, someone help me out.","I feel like I'm in an endless cylce and I can't really tell when it starts or ends.
Hi, I'm a 22 year old male and I feel like I am not present at all. I had a situationship with this girl and she told me at a certain period, I just stopped being present with her. I couldn't tell why or when it happened, she just told me she could tell and it's an amazing thing about women. They know when you're being the real you. That ended up in the dirt cause I couldn't get my act together. It's subsided into other areas in my life and I just feel like I am surviving. You wouldn't be able to tell if you saw me, hell I wouldn't be able to tell if I saw me. I feel like I am suffering and this is the first time I have taken time to detail it out for myself. I really need help. I want to get better or at least more into the things I was interested in. The only thing I've been able to pinpoint is that when uncertainty comes into my life, I kind of just switch off. I don't know when I do but I just feel the side effects.
I just don't feel anything anymore. That's what I told the girl and it ended. I guess it's not something to tell them but I didn't want to lie to her. She was the best person I'd had this far but I just didn't feel like I have enough to give. 
I'm tired. I need help. I can't make sense out of this and honestly I'd appreciate anything from anyone. Kindly help me out. I don't know where to categorise this but I want to be stoic so I added it here. Please help me understand and give me habits I should begin or end.",Stoicism,1705387944.0,t3_197wl1y,1.0,4
How to handle resentment/grudge - Or even better turn it into compassion?,"Greetings my friends,

I have a pretty unpleasant situation at the moment.
I work as a medical massage therapist and treat a lot of different people and sometimes there are just people who are really difficult for me to deal with.
Characteristics like: Bad hygiene, impatiently and often tense people make me feel very anxious and borderline angry.
I notice that it impacts my work in a pretty bad manner and even worse, it makes me anticipate these situations for the next day and I begin to be disgusted by the work that I actually love doing.

How I discovered Stoicism. How did you guys discover Stoicism?,"Technically there are a wide range of things that lead to my discovery and pursuit of Stoicism, but the main two reasons were: Breakup and David Goggins. Before I continue, **I know that David Goggins is not a Stoic.**

I read both of his books: “*Can’t Hurt Me*” and “*Never Finished*”, and it was extremely inspiring. He has been through *so much* hardship in his life that if he were to just completely fail in his life, no one would blame him. They’d excuse it under the premise that because of all the hardship he’s been through, it’s expected for him to fail. Instead of allowing the hardship to ruin the rest of his life, he used it as fuel and became a Navy Seal, an ultra-marathon runner, completed a bunch of Iron-mans, and a fucking author despite his severe learning disability. I’ve also been through much hardship; abuse (physical and sexual), homelessness, and a lot more which I will not list because…honestly it just feels odd listing it all. From his books, I learned a key lesson: It’s not what happens to you that matters, but who you are despite everything that matters.

Fast forward to the breakup, I got cheated on, discovered it was going on for a while yadda yadda. I was angry, felt humiliated, sad, hurt, but from what I learned, I decided that I can either let this break me, or I can use this situation as a challenge to maintain my character and not allow this situation to destroy me. So, I took on the challenge. Instead of acting out of anger, I had a conversation with them in order to gain understanding, I forgave them (after ending the relationship of course), and treated them with as much respect and kindness as I would to anyone else despite what they did to me, with no desire to receive any of that back. Day after day of doing this, I found myself feeling extremely happy and honestly excited. I was like “You’re telling me that a 5 year relationship just ended from cheating, and I can be THIS GOOD? Even after everything that happened?” Yes, those were sad times, but the fact that I maintained and even improved my character despite that is something that will stick with me forever. 

So, I decided to continue with the momentum by learning even more. I thought if this is something I was able to learn on my own, I can only imagine what I can learn from others. So I looked up “Books every man should read” on reddit, and found meditations. Then through meditations, I decided to join the Stoicism subreddit where I then found Epictetus’s Discourses, and the rest is history.",Stoicism,1705375683.0,t3_197sqog,0.87,6

Beginner's Philosophy Book Club," This is the perfect time to join if you're new to stoicism or philosophy and looking for a supportive community to explore big questions together. We re total beginners in philosophy so there's no need for any previous knoweldge in the subject, the book club is starting from the basics and it's only a couple of months old. We just finished our first second reading, now we're starting an introductory book and that's why I'm looking for new members, if you are interested this is the perfect moment to join!

&#x200B;

**Resources**

We plan on following an average reading list for an undegraduate course in philosophy. We started with ""Think"" by Simon Blackburn, an introductory book into philosophy. If you don't have the resources, I will provide them.

**Schedule**

We meet once a week, on Sunday at 18 GMT. During these meetings we review and discuss our readings. Discussion questions on the topics at hand are be prepared beforehand, I usually use both human and AI inputs to write discussion questions but feel free to contribute in whatever way you want.

**Requisites**

* Passion. The books we are going to read are not exactly fun read if you don't like the subject matter. I've noticed that a significant amount of people get demoralized when they approach the text as they turn out differntly from they expected.
* Consistency. I plan on reading thirty-five to fifty pages a week (five to seven pages a day). It's not a huge time commitment but it is still a time commitment.
* I don't really care about age but I prefer people over 18 for this club.
* Discord, we use this platform.",Stoicism,1705345159.0,t3_197go4c,0.78,5
Stoic advice on street fights,"24 M. Was physically assaulted by club staff (14 v/s 3 of us) 2 years ago. That has given me a great deal of PTSD.

I know the usual advice is to avoid physical fights. But if you’re having a confrontation with someone and they punch you first, what to do then? What if someone teases my sister or gf? What if they are being unnecessarily physically aggressive?

In such cases do I get away and call the authorities or fight?? It’s somewhat of a pride thing too. Running way from such situations feels weak and hurts my pride. 

Thinking about all this has given me great social anxiety. 

And yes, I am not afraid of getting beaten up. I don’t feel anxious in confrontations with known people. It’s only with strangers because there’s fear of death.

I've constantly made excuses my whole life and it was pointed out to me recently that I try to avoid responsibility as much as possible and I'm inclined to agree. I struggle deeply with time management and being considerate of others' priorities schedule wise. Stoicism has helped me learn to see these problems within myself and begin to think before I act, however I'm finding difficulty in working through these specific problems in life. Are there any thought exercises or other stoic practices that have helped any of you with these kinds of issues?

"Kahneman and Klein (2009) stated, “a psychology of judgment and decision making that ignores intuitive skill is seriously blinkered” (p. 525).","As far as I know, Stoicism advises people to avoid making decisions or judgments by relying on their intuition or first impression. What do you guys think about the studies done on decision-making, that is on system 1 and system 2 thinking. These studies say that they both have a place in making optimal decisions. I am not talking about our brain's ability to compute the speed and angle of a ball that we can catch with the right timing. I am talking about decisions to let's say let our anger out in a situation to set some boundaries or protect ourselves without rationalising it before doing so.

Tips on managing emotions,"I have always been a highly emotional person. Feeling intense emotions is a symptom of my ADHD, so it’s basically a chemical thing in my brain that I cannot control, so I need to learn to work with it, and manage it. 

One way it’s currently affecting me is with dating. I become prematurely excited about a new connection, to the point of feeling euphoria and exhilaration after one or two conversations with a potential partner. I project all kinds of fantasies and expectations onto the connection, without having much information about who they really are. Then, when they turn out not to be as great of a match as I thought, I struggle to walk away, and feel utterly devastated at the loss, despite not having known them or really forming a relationship with them.

My Mum has cancer.,"In December, Mum was diagnosed with a cyst. It was cancerous and thankfully, they said it was localised. Recently, she had her operation to remove it. They found that the cancer was worse than they anticipated and it was spreading and that chemo is needed. They are hopeful we will win.

I prepared myself mentally. I meditate every day, I felt the emotions, I reflected on the situation, tried to accept that there is a possibilty that mum could die. I gave my very best to my mum in terms of emotional support and care. I am her shield in life (domestic abuse) and emotionally she relies on me. I promised her that the only thing I can offer is my undying and committed support to her and that we will fight to the end.

Today I went to see her for the first time after the operation. Mentally I thought I was prepared. Nothing could have ever prepared me to see my beloved mother in pain, barely speaking and full of pipes and wires. It hit and cut deep on a very emotional level.

I started to cry silently. No one wants to see their mother like this. Somehow the Stoic training kicked in. I felt myself thinking: I am a human being, it is ok to cry in a situation like this and I am feeling my emotions. It is ok. Emotions must be expressed. This is not within my control and I am operating well in the things I can control, that is my mind and actions. 

I stayed there till visiting hours were over, made sure she was comfortable, and left.

As much as I like reading and learning Stoicism, I think the biggest teacher of Stoicism is life. This terrible situation is totally out of my control, rest for my little personal actions. We have a long road ahead, but I believe with a good mindset, I will be able to navigate the stormy seas that are ahead while supporting mother.

I am sorry if this may sound like humble brag. It is just me expressing my emotions on the Stoic subreddit, where experiences like these remind me how much I still have to learn.",Stoicism,1705242563.0,t3_196h2vx,0.97,187

Meditations 5.5 for me is the definition of stoicism in a nutshell.,"“Thou sayest, Men cannot admire the sharpness of thy wits—Be it so: but there are many other things of which thou canst not say, I am not formed for them by nature. Show those qualities then which are altogether in thy power, sincerity, gravity, endurance of labour, aversion to pleasure, contentment with thy portion and with few things, benevolence, frankness, no love of superfluity, freedom from trifling, magnanimity. Dost thou not see how many qualities thou art immediately able to exhibit, in which there is no excuse of natural incapacity and unfitness, and yet thou still remainest voluntarily below the mark? or art thou compelled through being defectively furnished by nature to murmur, and to be stingy, and to flatter, and to find fault with thy poor body, and to try to please men, and to make great display, and to be so restless in thy mind? No by the gods: but thou mightest have been delivered from these things long ago. Only if in truth thou canst be charged with being rather slow and dull of comprehension, thou must exert thyself about this also, not neglecting it nor yet taking pleasure in thy dulness.”


It says that if we don’t have s desirable trait by nature alone that it’s in our power to gain it by dedication 

I want to be a kind and smart man, I’m kind by nature but not very smart (it’s obvious that a lot of factors come into play that Marcus Aurelius couldn’t have understood back then, such as in my case where I’m a neurodivergent person but that doesn’t mean that I can’t strive to learn more with a combination of meditation, therapy and discipline of study) 

The quote emphasises subjects of dedication, control of pleasure, acceptance of one’s luck (or the idea of fortuna), benevolence, etc 

It teaches us to not blame external factors and that the talent can be surpassed if the dedication overcomes the talent, as someone who have always compared myself with my peers and always thought that (i’m slow and there’s nothing that I can do to change it) this quote hit me like a brick to the head",Stoicism,1705261004.0,t3_196o3kq,0.89,13

Advice on Grief,"Hi everybody.

I found my Dad yesterday morning. He'd died suddenly in his home, alone. This hurts immensely to think about. 

Around 8 years ago I also found my mother dead. I thought I'd processed that, but I'm finding all those feelings are coming back up now. Maybe that's natural, I'm not sure. 

A couple of months back I had started to dabble in Stoicism as a concept. I've listened to Meditations and found it really insightful in reframing everyday life. 

I was hoping to get some advice on the Stoic approach to grief, as I'm really struggling here to tell you the truth. Could anybody point me in the right direction?

I got an idea of the basic stoic theory and practises, but I find it quite difficult to get it ""under my skin"". 

Is there a boot camp or other similar venue somewhere in the world where students of stoicism for 1-2 weeks meet to discus the practical matters and live stoicly under the guidance of a competent instructor? Not unlike how things went about at the stoa poikile in Athens.

I saught friendship with a virtous woman, but the admiration turned into affection. She is spoken for and although she is - I wanted to tell her my feelings for I felt to deprive someone of choice is not right. My choice was to give her the power. I made it clear, that if she should what I would call a 'negative result' then I would do everything in my power to keep our relationship the same: friends. (Because I truly respect this woman.)I want her to feel guilt free and, if possible flattered by my affection. This I achieved - I believe. But now, I have confessed, and unfortunately said negative result has arrived I need help on thworting how I pine for her, at least physically. She's really beautiful and it's hard to not see her like that. I want to act with virtue and be the friend that she wants. But the pain is real.

Stoic wisdom,"I am fairly new to stoicism (seriously studying for 6 months). I have learned many lessons from Marcus Aurelius and try to incorporate them in my life.

She has an MRI coming soon and she is worried that it has moved to her brain. I cannot relinquish the fear of the future and it is effecting my ability to live in the present. If this is part of the logos and I shouldn't fight the current of fate, then how do I be okay with what is to come, so that I can continue to love her with the time we are alotted.

Stoicism allowed me to put my ego asidw and handle situations/ opinions better,"Last year I made a psychological evaluation and one of the results was “difficulty controlling the ego” and ironically enough I didn’t accepted that, but it was right I always took things personally and if anyone else disagreed with me I would get upset and try to use random arguments and play the role of the victim

I saw a post here a short while ago about how Marcus Aurelius fed people to animals, and what that says about the credibility of his Meditations.  I don't know what the exact context was of my post title when he wrote it, but as I reflect on it, I am taking everything I have written here into consideration. 

Also, I try to praise loudly and criticize quietly, but I Still critize, blame people when I don't get what i want from them, especially if they've been reliable in the past. It's the inconsistency of people that gets to me alittle, because even though I am not perfect in my interactions with people, I prioritize being consistent(although it's out of my hands how people perceive my consistency.) So whenever i catch myself mentally blaming someone, I lean into it, but I ""level"" myself by adding to that mentally placating the person, or adding to that the mental equivalent of being physiologically distracted. Non of these is exactly in Stoicism(because non of those involves being super logical), but they are in a form of therapy I've found useful. And yes, I do know how important being logical about everything is, how useful logic is, and how indispensable it is to the life I am trying to live.

"How can I keep out all desires out of my mind, when its also my duty to push myself to work hard enough to provide for my family","I am always in a twist and turn between two career, one is high risk, high rewards, another is low risk, good rewards but with hell lot of hardwork. I always wanted to try the first one, but the duty that I can fail my family completely always has kept me at bay, it was didn't felt ""stoic"" to puruse just because of the passion, so I decided that I will cut off all my liesure time and give to both, 1st & 2nd career (hidden from fam)

Rather than commiting to one ""career"" choice, I have commited to a routine and detached myself from the results of either outcome, I always felt, trying to catch 2 rabbits, won't get me either, but not thinking about the result (which ain't in my control) and keeping my focus in the moment & the process will do me good. but anxiety hits me when my family asks me when is my career taking off. 

Since I always try not to never think about the milestone or result, and rather than focus on everyday, the thoughts of ""pursuing"" or even doing two things in a day, which would seem normal to anyone, takes a big toll on my reasonsing as to where am I headed? Am i being selfish not commiting to one thing that do my family good and excel in it. (doing my duty rather than running for small passions) or am I wrong to puruse a thing in the act of desiring it for my family (which evidently does affect my peace & can be attested 98% by the world, because they are or have been in the same boat) should I just perform my one duty without the care reaching my desire & focus on my sole virute ",Stoicism,1705158097.0,t3_195pumv,0.63,2
What is the view of depression in stoicism,"I was introduced to stoicism by this greek doctor that I worked with two years ago and suffice to say some of the principles had helped me through some dark times in my life. 

I am curious to see the perspective of a stoic in terms of depression. I constantly get a sudden attack of extreme sadness with or without trigger which manifests in physical tiredness (too tired to move even a little) 

I think the scary thing about depression is how real you think what lies/uncertainty/assumption/conclusion your mind tells you. 

Like many others struggling the same, I get tired too, tried many things but to no avail.

[DISCUSSION] Investigating Anger is the answer,"Good morning Stoa, a few days ago I came here after I had an *incident*. I got angry and lost my temper.

It was very uncool of me, and that lead to a lot of introspection, analysis, reflections, writing, and research.  

Not only I have come to the realization that I was wrong, but that I have been wrong all my life.

I had the wrong belief systems and worldviews, which rendered my analysis of the situations faulty.

Regardless that I was wronged, I had no business at getting angry, let alone losing my temper. That is never the answer to anything. I had faulty belief systems.

I have reframed my thinking and my belief systems, thanks in partly to Stoicism.

I didn't work the entire 2023 year and I don't even have any health insurance. The only thing I did was trying to complete classes for college.

I feel like I'm too old for college especially going in university because it seems like time consuming and finically expensive. I'm currently in community college and they do offer various certification programs and even two year degree programs but I'm not not sure what to get into as Im worrying like stuff about Ai expanding then bunch of layoffs happened. I want to get in a career that will help in long run and be substantial. I'm just stuck in this rut for about a year and even this new year hasn't been to a great start.

"""What should be done?"" My thoughts on this","Since I was little I've always been very inspired by history, and I've always wanted to 'make a difference', I guess is a good way of putting it. In short, I wanted to no longer be an NPC in the world, and today I see that things are a little more complicated, I think today I understand that this is something that we all try to do, and that perhaps this is what makes us part of the whole , we all want to be different and that's something that makes us equal, I think. Anyway, I always had this desire to find something that would make me do something for the world, not caring about fame or anything like that, but just to know that I contributed a little to the future of humanity, something like Newton's contributions to Physics, a subject that I have always loved. A little because of this, I decided to start a physics course at university, with the childhood dream that it would be easy to achieve something of this magnitude, but then I was faced with the fact that maybe I didn't like physics that much to dedicate myself to it. an entire life. I mean, the more time passes, the more I realize that I'm not an academic. I love physics, but I also love many other things that take up my time and that I consider just as important. It's as if the side of me that wants to do something for the world conflicts with the side of me that just seeks my happiness. On the one hand, I fear spending my whole life searching in vain, and in the end realizing that I wasted my chances of enjoying everything I could. And on the other side, I fear reaching the end of my life, taking advantage of every opportunity to be happy, but having to carry the burden of feeling like I haven't achieved anything, of not having left anything useful behind, as if my existence as a human asked me to do something. Currently the answer I have to this dilemma is that, no one who really changed the world had the objective of 'changing the world', they had an insatiable passion for something, and leaving a legacy of that was just a consequence of that passion. It's like an eternal doubt, I want to fulfill a duty and not be selfish, at the same time that I can't say there is something, a passion, that makes me focus on it that much, because I love many things.

&#x200B;

Forgive me for this huge text hehe. I know I'm still young and immature, so forgive me too if I wrote something clearly absurd (Also if this has nothing to do with stoicism, I'm still new), but that's how I feel. These existential questions have always plagued me, but I like to think, I like to think about them and any work that delves into this type of thing. A work that I can use to draw a parallel about how I feel is the work of fiction and fantasy Fate Stay Night, more specifically the character Emiya Shirou. In short, and spoilers ahead, the game has 3 routes in which Shirou makes different decisions. In one of them, he decides to become a hero of justice, even though he knows all the bitterness that this path would bring, and the story really deals with that, it is a complete break with that hero stereotype, but Shirou still chooses to be, which I think it's very pretty. In another route, however, he decides to be the hero of just one person, Sakura, the girl he loves. In one route he decides to embrace his childish ideals in the name of a greater good, and in another he decides to embrace his own happiness. In both cases he decides to embrace this passion, and I feel exactly in the middle of it, remembering that it is just a parallel. Trying to be a 'normal' person or trying to be something more. I see possible regrets in both of them. I know there's no right answer, but I think I wanted to vent a little about this, and I wanted to know if you guys had any thoughts on this.

How should you actually read Meditations?,"So long story short...I've been an admirer and reader of the Stoics, particularly Marcus Aurelius, for years.

And so I often ask myself the question ""How did \[insert Stoic\] do it?"" At least for Marcus Aurelius it seems part of the answer was keeping himself accountable with his personal journal - what we read as Meditations today. And Meditations is a beautiful book, just...I've found it really hard to read. The problem might be the version, I'm using the Hicks version, but it's always seemed like a collection impossibly difficult maxims that I could appreciate in a moment of serenity but not in a moment of crisis.

Is the problem the version I'm using? Am I studying Meditations wrong? Is it just my fault for being slow-witted? Any advice would be much appreciated.

Struggling to connect with others - feel like I am repeating the same thing over and over again.,"Life seems to be a constant struggle. I feel like I am running around in circles, infinitely so. 

I have struggled with depression for a long time (and I also have Aspergers). My depression is kind of situational. If I have friends, work and things to do, it doesn’t emerge. But when I don’t, life doesn’t feel worth living. I take mediciation for it (and therapy) which has helped immensely, but I can’t help but think that I seem to be stuck in this cycle that I cannot seem to break out of. 

My depression led to me dropping out of high school. Despite this, I worked my ass off at home and made it to one of the best colleges in the country.

While I find it easy to make 1:1 connections with others,  I never seem to connect with groups or make a solid circle of friends. The 1:1 friendships I have are often really intense but for one reason or another they die out. And for really inexplicable reasons. Sometimes they will go back home, then when college starts they suddenly don’t want to talk much or hang out anymore. I don’t get it.

I graduated college with great academics but not much to show for it in the way of friendships. For career reasons, I decided to do a masters program at again one of the best colleges. But I seem to be struggling with the same problem. I can have great conversations with a lot of people. But I don’t have a group. And sometimes I’ll arrange things with people, but people have yet to invite me to anything, except for birthday parties. I want to be hanging out with people, going out, having a good time. Yet I seem to be alone on Friday night, again, while everyone else is doing exactly that. 

I can’t seem to break this cycle I seem to be stuck in. I think my Aspergers may be a part of why I can’t connect in the same way that others do, but I can’t seem to figure out what I’m doing wrong, even with therapy. I don’t know how much more of this I can take.",Stoicism,1705092228.0,t3_19559zv,0.5,0

"How Stoicism Helped Me Throughout the Years, Despite Key Misunderstandings","*I hope this little tale can serve as inspiration for those of you interested in Stoicism only as a shield and less so as a toolbox. A*s it turned out for me, it provided and even more powerful operating system.

&#x200B;

I first stumbled upon Stoicism in 2012 as a graduate. I read ""Letters from a Stoic"" as I imagine newly converted Christians read the Bible; quite literally and with great joy and fulfillment.

At the time, I was a young man who had listened to everything from Dan Pena, Joe Dispenza, and to some extent Tony Robbins, even though he always seemed too ""guru-ish"" for me to really believe in. Stoicism provided me with the operating system I needed at the time.

However, I mistook being stoic for not letting emotions get to me. This served me very well for years. I overcame one challenge after another, climbed the corporate ladder quickly, and moved all over Europe in search of additional personal and professional growth. By many metrics, I was a young successful man with everything ahead of me.

One day, I realized my current job and life situation were no longer challenging. Despite making good money, living in a safe and affluent city, and earning a decent amount while traveling often, I was bored. I needed action. So, I took the leap, leaving that job for another and moving once again to a different city in Europe.

It was shortly after making the decision to move again that I realized much of my boredom and lack of growth where I was actually had very little to do with my surroundings, and everything to do with myself. By, in a Stoic manner, turning off most of my emotions, both the highs and lows of my intense life felt bland.

Shortly after, I returned to Stoicism and this forum. I realized that Stoicism is really about accepting feelings and then ""applying"" Stoicism, instead of using it as a mental filter to mute feelings and numb sensations. At one point, I was afraid that this new approach would make me lose one of my strongest abilities in life: to endure hardship.

But, as it turns out, this new way of interpreting Stoicism, for me, provided an even more powerful operating system to tackle everyday life. I learned how to accept feelings, embrace them, and power through. The acceptance step became crucial, as it helped me feel pain, enabling fruitful reflection and therefore progress.

I hope this little tale can serve as inspiration for those of you interested in Stoicism only as a shield and less so as a toolbox. If possible, try to repeat my misstake :)",Stoicism,1704895967.0,t3_19396dw,0.93,12

Help with list of Stoic quotes,"One of the things I lament about so-called ""Stoic quotes"" online is that they rarely, if ever, include the source.

The Jean Valjean problem. Does stoicism indeed say he should not steal bread?,"Wanted to raise this question after listening to a discussion on a podcast. I am having some issues with it, so I'm coining the phrase the Jean Valjean problem  


In Les Miserables, Jean Valjean steals bread and is cast into prison for it. He eventually escapes and becomes a better person. 


The problem for stoicism as I understand it is the theft part. I may not understand stoicism correctly here,  but I believe that since stoics state virtue is the highest goal, and that our own life is less important than this, stealing a loaf of bread to survive (assuming for the sake of argument it is a life and death situation,  no escaping the thought experiment by claiming another option like borrowing money to buy bread) is considered less virtuous than not stealing and succumbing to death. 


I am not sure if this is a correct interpretation,  but I cannot agree with it for 2 eeasons:


1) Life isn't worthless. The value of continuing life at the expense of stolen bread is worth it. The value of a life is more than a loaf of bread so even though theft is not virtuous, it is excusable in this situation. 


2) life is worthwhile specifically because permitting a life to continue,  even at the expense of virtue, means that the person can grow and become virtuous over time. They cannot do that if they are dead.

Seeking comfort after dog’s loss,"My childhood dog, best friend and only company has passed away after fighting tumours for last 4 months. I am 22. Yesterday was supposed to be a regular veterinary visit and schedule to remove one tumour. He was 12, turned it just 1 month ago and was a golden retriever. He had multiple tumours which were operated and taken out, but one kept coming for the third time. It was his 4th operation in 4 months. Last days he was not eating and drinking that much as his tumour was in his mouth and was bleeding and hurting him. He went to the car so happy, full of life. I knew that it would take him but not that quick. Vet took him to immediate operation as his tumour started bleeding heavily, and we were told to pick him up in few hours. Upon arriving, the vet said he removed it and that he is slowly waking up but still bleeding so he advises to leave him overnight. At 9PM we got a call that he passed away after failed reanimation. My world broke.

We didn’t properly said goodbye. I can’t believe that the last picture of him is from yesterday shortly before leaving. My family is broken too. What hurts me is that he died without us, after promising him that we will pick him up as usual. Last night was tough, barely slept at all. I am on and off from stoicism in last year, but I know core concepts and it helped me a little. We are to bury him tomorrow as we have to pick him up today. It shook me to my core as I remember passing of my grandpa which was a huge part of my life, let’s say the same way (without anyone, alone in hospital bed due to Covid). I lost both of them without seeing them when they needed us the most.

I seek some comfort as I can’t seem to process it yet, and I know I won’t for some time but I am thinking some reply company can’t do the damage.",Stoicism,1704789922.0,t3_192a89z,0.74,7

I’m at a loss.,"For some background information I’m a high school senior who’s graduating in 4 months.

For the past 3 years of high school, an individual in my friend group has talking mad shit about me. Whether it’s about my failed romantic endeavors or something embarrassing I’ve done, he has not failed to bring it up in conversation with random people to make himself look better. As a result, my close friends have told me many people think I’m a bitch for letting him say this shit to me and not do anything back (I was raised to not inflict violence unless my life is danger).

This mindset has done irreparable damage to my reputation- people think I’m a pussy and hella girls aren’t interested because they think I’m a clown. It actually hurts man.

how do I attain happiness in my routine and life?," I've recently reflected on what had brought me joy in the past, the current moment and also could in the future. This is a copy of my thoughts, and I'd love to hear other people's thoghts on it :)

so, how do I attain happiness in my daily routine and life? 

Everyone want to be happy, and there are different ways for people to achieve that, each person has their own way that they persue. Taking my mates for example, at least what I see on the outside, they occasionally go out to parties, get high and drink, eat junk food and those are usually their highlights of the day. 

But that's not what I truely enjoy doing. Literally today, had my first pizza in probably three years, and it was seriously pretty bad. The taste was actually aweful. I felt nauseous afterwards, and regardless if I had a group involvement in my class I would prefer to pick a different, more nutricous meal for lunchtime. Thinking back to when I had a streak of a couple of days of being active, excercising and eating enough nutricous food, I literally get a sense of freedom, acomplishment and expecially peace.  

This was one of the things that brings me back to my question: How do I find happiness and purpose? Since it doesn't seem like a reasonable option to have a completely concrete step-by-step plan to be happy, since things change and you need to adapt, but I am aware many perspectives, healthy and unhealthy, picking the option for delayed or instant gradification, and in the long run it's always better to opt for the delayed, healthy option. Just recently I've watched a video, it's blantly obvious but the things that you are doing now are not effecting you right now, but rather the things you did years, months, days prior do. And in reverse your future depends on what you literally do at the current moment.  

So how do I attain happiness in my routine and in life?  

I need to find a balance between work and life.  

Currently I need to get education going and persue the path of excellence in academics. Afterwards I will be able to have a job that is high paying, so I can do whatever I want, not be constrained by a lack of rescources. Of course not to forget that for long term happiness it's highly important to pick a job that you actually enjoy doing, possibly using the method of ikagai, and also considering your established type of intelligence that you were born with (reference from a podcast that robert freene was on and mentioned that matter in his book mastery, the types are: linguistic, logical-mathematical, inter/-arpersonal, naturalistic, musical, kinesthetic and spacial intelligence; source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/harvard-psychologist-types-of-intelligence-where-do-you-score-highest-in.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/harvard-psychologist-types-of-intelligence-where-do-you-score-highest-in.html) ) Additionally, reflecting on the chliche suggestion that you should be enjoying your teen years while you can (go out and party, get drunk, high, not care about what you fuel your body with, when you sleep, etc.) I personally don't consider that view of ""enjoying your young teens"" as true enjoyment.  

In the moment in which I reach the top of a mountain after a high hike, having delicous dinner after a long day, waking up for a tasty breakfast, the morning sky, the sunset, the sun rise, the colors that the sky can take during different hours of the day, the way clouds move though out atmosphere, the acomplishment when you start comprehending an interesting topic, having deeptalk with a friend, the butterflies that you suddenly get when seeing a certain someonehaving music literally run through your veins when inducing it or just listening; the flow when reading an incaptivating book, the adrenaline kick when doing some crazy activity, sights of cities, landmarks, nature, different cultures, architecture, languages, customs, fashion or just calm walks acompanied by your close ones or just just yourself; there are endless opportunities that are here to be discovered, literally endless.  

Drifting back to reality, above I've listed multiple examples of things, that some far have brought sincere joy to my life and contributed to my life's purpose. Ejoying existing while growing for the betterment of myself and humanity. Obviously those moments cannot, at the time that I'm writing this down, happen on a daily basis. Right now I am given the opportunity, all ressources necessary, to educate myself, get a job and open the door for many more occassions which will bring me joy. 

It's absolutely obligatory for me not to let into brainfog, to start neglecting my health and being able to enjoy the simplicity and beauty of raw nature due to my dopanime receptors (and just my physical and mental condition) be fried to the brim of exctintion. Not let myself forget the hidden dangers of instant gradification and get in a hellish loop that day by day would bring me closer to depression, anxiety, shame and even death.  

So how do I balance my work and free time in a sustainable, meaningful way? 

It is of significance to consider that laying out an unrealistic schedule of a self-improvement type of guru is not going to be beneficial because of multiple reasons. The motive of it isn't really wrong, but the execution is usually not backed by scientific proof, and a sense of purpose. Why do so many people fail their new years resulution? Quiet frankly, they are not thinking about both long and short term dradification. There needs to be a balanced amount of both, else (at least that's what it's been like for me) it's not maintainable. It's so simple to skip going to the gym and  just have that last junky snack, because it's so much easier to do so. Instead just show up to the gym, don't obligate yourself to do a full on three hour workout, seriously just show up and do the bare minimun. Only thrity minutes is totally enough. If you've done, and keep picking this option consistenly, then you can do whatever would please you afterwards. Usually when you've already brought yourself to start, show up for that half an hour, is what it needs to get the stone rolling for a more productive way of living. You will get endorphines by doing the sport, a happy hormone, and the meal after excersising always tastes better if youre slightly worn out.  

And if you consistenly repeat an effective, maintainable routine, you will eventually reach a point where you can do whatever, whenever, with the people you love. That doesn't mean you can't do those things in the process of getting there, it is of most significace that you incooperate enough healthy happiness boosting activities into your routine in order to be able to sustain the discipline. Because in words it's easier written than done, actually do the due paper, decline unhealthy habits, but it can be done. You need to reward youself with ""natural"" induced gradification (note: look these methods up, backed up science based evidence), self reflection, self awareness and a sense of purpose.  

It's impossible to summarrise how to have a sense of purpose briefly, but the main point is that every person has their own, evolving purpose/reason to live for. Since the world is evoling and so many things are out of my control, I rather focus on the things that are in my power, like picking to go on a peaceful walk, enjoy a couple minutes of chilling with my loving cat, etc, that give me some direction of purpose. Do things that are genuinly meaningful to me.  ",Stoicism,1704761683.0,t3_1921ix9,0.87,6

I am going through incredible pressure from my surroundings and the feeling of being stabbed in the back.," 

About a year ago, I started a project with a few friends at that time. We were just a branch of a larger project that someone initiated in the capital city. The completion of that project was supposed to bring benefits to all of us. Hoping for a positive outcome, I handed over complete control to my friend at that time. We went through a tough period together, working hard and under a lot of stress. I lost 5kg due to anxiety, and it also cost me a lot of money. The project was completed a few months ago. The people in charge in the capital city are now working and reaping the benefits. I waited for them to call me and offer something, a job or a way to earn money, because we went through all of that together. However, they never contacted me. Now I find out that all this time, they were communicating with my friend who was the coordinator for my area, but he pushed me aside and is collecting benefits for his closest circle of people and family. I am practically excluded from the story even though I did everything that everyone else did, even more. My family and friends ask me every day when something will come out of it, when I can expect something. Some people even have expectations that I can help them, even though I can't help myself. It's very difficult to be deceived and betrayed, especially in a small town. I don't know what to do; I don't have contact with people from the capital city. Also, I wouldn't want to confront my 'friend' because maybe something will come from him. Please advise me because I can't sleep at night, and I can't bear to see my sad parents because I was deceived in some way.""

Is there a contradiction between stoicism and modern psychology about control of emotions ?,"If I understand well, to simplify stoicism tells us to control emotions

"The Jedi code sounds like it was written by a stoic, and the Sith code a hedonist.","*There is no emotion, there is peace*.  

*There is no ignorance, there is knowledge.*  

*There is no passion, there is serenity.*  

*There is no chaos, there is harmony.*  

*There is no death, there is the Force.*  

The first line I’m not sure I completely agree with. There are things like rational joy, but in a broader sense I think stoics would at least agree in part. Emotions are contrived from our judgments, which are a construct. Inner peace though is a common stoic theme, and is the result of sound judgment, not false beliefs assented into emotion.

The second line reminds me of a theme in stoicism that the true stoic sage is never upset, because he only has knowledge. Socrates famously said “the only sin is ignorance”.  

The third line is another stoic tenant. Marcus Aurelius talks in the meditations often about avoiding passions as they can take away from your rationality and sound judgment. A good sound judgment and an understanding of nature, will result in a natural sense of serenity and joy.  

The fourth line is again, often brought up in stoicism. I interpret chaos here as “unnatural”. Everything is natural, therefore nothing can be unnatural or chaotic. Chaos is a perception. A vicious storm isn’t chaotic, it’s just a storm. A result of nature that brings harmony and balance.  

And finally the last line. I’m not precisely sure what metaphor is meant by *there is no death*, as there is of course death. Maybe they meant you ought not to fear death. Maybe they meant you never really die because you’re resorbed back into the force. And the force could be interpreted in stoic physics as *the logos* as the ancient philosophers say.  

With all that dissected here is the sith code by contrast. You can make your own interpretations, but I think it’s clear why this doctrine is adopted by “the baddies” in the Star Wars universe. It clearly leads to a troubled, never satisfied, self destructive, vice consuming soul.  

*Peace is a lie. There is only Passion.*  

*Through Passion, I gain Strength.*  

*Through Strength, I gain Power.*  

*Through Power, I gain Victory.*  

*Through Victory my chains are Broken.*  

*The Force shall free me.*

People new to Stoicism should learn that they are referred to as Modern Stoics, which is a secular part of Traditional Stoicism. They leave out the most important part of Traditional Stoicism, Providence, and living according to Nature. If you read Marcus, Seneca, and Epictetus, Nature is foundational and is the only way Stoicism truly works to reach eudaimonia or happiness.

What is the *""Stoic""* answer?

We know that the world runs mostly on emotionally-driven decisions, we see it every day; so is it *silly* to wish otherwise? Should we as Stoics be like Ninjas, not wishing that the world were different, but improvise, adapt, and overcome life's situations as they manifest themselves to us?

Recently been coming out and having difficult thoughts,"
I’ve been coming out and being more open about my sexuality but often times my thoughts are irrational and fear based ill think that the person is gonna spread this information or visualise them telling their friends and spouse. Obviously these are assumptions and not reality but my mind is so scared. Another example is recently I told my coworker about my sexuality and I was shaking and my mind was racing throughout the next few days, about whether they would tell others or fear of rejection. I come from a muslim family and they don’t know and alot of my fear stems from them finding out and selfishly I stay at home as a dependent and save money and plan to move once I graduate university. I know I am not my thoughts and these are learned patterns from suppressing myself since a child to try and appease others. As I was smacked as a kid for acting feminine I conformed. 

Any advice about these thoughts and fear based thinking is appreciated, have you dealt with something similar?",Stoicism,1704671263.0,t3_1916j1n,0.67,2

Dealing with constantly noisy enviroment due to inconsidarate neighbors,"I am currently in life situation where noisy neighbors are hugely impacting my live. Constant music, partying on weekends etc. The constant noise stop after 10pm usually so police can't really do anything. But there is still things that wake you up in the middle of night. We tried talking with them but understood that they don't care and first time they did this they started to play the music louder and shouting slurs at us. 

The solution for this in my case is to keep on working on my business to earn money so I could upgrade my current accomodation and finally have peace and quite, but issue is that all this noise is hugely impacting me both psysically and mentally. It's hard to have a productive day when there is constant noise or you are tired because lack of sleep or noise itself.

I've tried meditating on these thoughts for months, and although I've gotten much better at controlling my reaction, I still feel the initial reaction all the same.

"On Virtue, Asceticism and the Request for Help","Hi everyone

I would like to ask you what exercises you need to do in order to grow in virtue. I read Marcus Aurelius several times, but I abandoned it in favor of the diatribes and the encheiridiona of Epictetus. I also read Cicero, whom I like very much because of his understanding of virtue.

1 Specific question: what do you think about asceticism as a preferential good that purifies all vices from man? Such as laziness, lack of self-discipline, and so on. Of course, this serves as a preliminary stage, for it is known that the man who tilles the soil, has uprooted the weeds, cut the earth, and sows or plants, that is, develops virtues. That's not to say that he hasn't done it before, but that getting rid of the superfluous helps. What do you think? (P.S. I'm a fan of Cynic asceticism)

2  Can virtue be exercised and will it always be present until we neglect it? I'm afraid that virtue is only an exercise of judgments in the mind that we hold onto, and that when they are lacking, it turns out that there is no virtue and never has been? After all, if it turns out that Stoic virtue is just a matter of the mind, I think I'd rather have Cicero's teaching on virtue than the Greek masters.

3  Do you have any internships that you can recommend to me? The reason I'm asking you this is that I'd rather deal with practices than just theoretical scripts on a lot of websites. I believe I can learn a lot from you, so if you would like to share some advice with me, I will be happy to hear it.

Please be patient and understanding, I'm not even sure if I gave the right flair (I'm sorry if I chose the wrong one). I try to learn new things and analyze what I already know, whether what I knew was really right.

Best regards!

Hi Stoics! Lend me your ear a moment please!,"Hey guys. I feel the desire to be very detailed here but I’ll try to keep it short and hopefully not break any rules while I’m at it.

I am 40 years old and I’m about 3 years outside of deconstructing from a lifelong Baptist brainwa… I mean, faith. I had always butted heads with fellow Christians, I always felt like it was all pretty fake and vain, and I was one of those delirious young Christians who thought I had a special connection with God, a certain special empathy for other human beings or something.

Anyways, when I was 35, my left foot started going numb and I figured it was just a pinched nerve in my back. Fast forward 3 years and now the numbness spread to my whole body, and even neurologists at Cleveland Clinic can’t figure it out, and say it has to be something genetic. (This is where I could really ramble, so I’ll stop myself here).

This was the straw that broke the Camel’s back, this is what finally pushed me through deconstruction and take that terrifying leap of ironic faith. I read a few books like Leaving the Fold, Age of Reason, etc. A lot of books on buddhism were also helpful in learning to meditate, but I felt like it was flirting too much with religion.

Then I read Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations, and that was it. Lights out, this dude spoke the language of my very soul. I’m happy to have found Stoicism! My biggest problem is that I am still so very hung up on my anger and resentment towards Yahweh, its so bad that it colors almost all of my thoughts. I still feel like a dictator is lording over everything. I still mentally lash out at him in my darkest times, even though I know I’m screaming at the void.

So, long story short, how do I kick this Jesus habit? Thanks for reading and sorry if I offended anyone. That snarky, passive aggressiveness towards Christianity is THE very thing I’m trying to address.

Edit: I know I could and should post this over in the ex-christian sub, and I’m definitely a lurker over there, but it can be a bit of an echo-chamber in there.",Stoicism,1704557978.0,t3_1903h7a,0.7,4

I am not new to Stoicism, I have read the classics and Pigliucci/Irvine; and I know that Stoicism is not about suppressing one's emotions.

I am posting here because the mods allow *""Seeking Stoic Advice""* posts, and because the comments here are the best quality comments across the entire Reddit ecosystem.

I am an old(er) Redditor and I have come a long way in my life; up until not long ago I thought that my life was pretty great, then the other day I lost my temper, something that had not happened in a very long time, and that I thought it was gone from my personality; but there I was. And it was ugly. I was ugly. Details withheld because they don't matter. Losing one's temper is uncalled for. Period.

But my reflections on what happens has led me to keen observation of my MO(s) and behavior, and I have come to the realization that:

1. I don't perform well in confrontations
2. I don't perform well under stress (stress real or imagined)
3. I play ""nice"" by default, but then turn ugly in situations #1 and #2 above.
4. So really, I am not that ""nice"".

I have read ""No More Mr Nice Guy"", as well as ""Not Nice"" and ""The Disease to Please"".

How to manage stress in gaming (and in general)?,"I'm a young man getting slowly into stoicism. It is like 4th day since i started reading about it more (I'm still in the middle of reading one of William B. Irvine's books, it's my first). I like playin a lot of dynamic, stressful games like e.g. ULTRAKILL. I think im playing rationally - trying some tactics, doing stuff to manage problems (prioritizing enemies, defending yourself etc.). Nontheless tend to feel a lot of stress. At first i was still raging, hitting my desk, but today i felt a bit of a progress - i was still very stressed, i sometimes felt angry, however i remained calm and ""took a deep breath"" and went ahead.

This applies to even some activities. In fact, i feel stress rn writing this (dunno why exactly tho).

Is this correct?,"So i have started studying stoicism and its been two months, and i have been journaling about a month of the thoughts am having daily and the judgements i pass onto things i try to examine those.

I won't go into much details and make this really long. Here's a brief context of the stuff that happened. Well i do corporate job and everyday we have requests which gets assigned to our team and whoever available senior will assign it to the resource who is available on that day. The problem is things get suddenly escalated to higher management and we need to complete those tasks ASAP.

What has happened one of the senior on my team assigned the request/task to me while i was on my week off. I got angry as to why she assigned the task but i did not confronted her because i was angry i just took the action just to remind her not to assign to someone who is in week off.

And i journaled the whole thing.

and it goes something like this.

Anger  
\------------------

An emotion which happens. When thare is Something unjust has happened.

Did that thing did unjust to me?

Well it was unjust. But let's not get into conclusion.

Let's think it this way.

Is assigning tasks is Something People Shouldn't do?Y  
es they should.

If they Should do then whom they should assign?  
The People who are available.

Now did she assign to Someone who was available on that day?  
NO .

I mean you do not serve food to a Person , who is not there to eat.

Then we know that you should assign the task to Someone who is available .

NOW

Is assigning task to Someone who is not available is an unjust act?

Its not an unjust act as she doesn't have knowledge as to who was available and who was not.

Hence anger should not have come there but we did not assent to that and did not made an impulsive act.

When is it okay to give unsolicited advice?,"Hello,

&#x200B;

I tried looking for a similar thread but found only posts talking about receiving unsolicited advice rather than giving it. So, I apologize if I'm retreading ground here.

&#x200B;

Basically though, I find my relationships with my friends suffer because I give off an aloof disposition (not on purpose). Many times my friends will bring up a problem they are having and I'm usually quiet. This is because I am worried about unsolicited advice or otherwise overstepping boundaries.

&#x200B;

I know it's quite okay to voice my opinion when explicitly asked, but find it harder to do so when my friends only imply they'd like advice. And often, I'm not even sure if that IS what they're implying.

&#x200B;

Because of this I think finding a deeper connection is sometimes difficult. Maybe I give off the vibe that I don't care, or perhaps it seems I am trying to change the subject outright.

&#x200B;

I also feel like I am denying my friends the decision as well. And I'm denying them a deeper insight into who I am that kind of prevents them from being comfortable around me. Maybe it seems like I'm hiding something or am coming off judgemental/stern.

&#x200B;

Well, what do you guys think? Am I caring too much what my friends think of me when I'm silent/reserved? Or do I just need to care more about authenticity? And when is proactively giving unsolicited advice acceptable?

&#x200B;

Would love to hear your thoughts on this. Thanks for your time and hope you're all well.

Afraid of how my family would react to my lack of beliefs,"Yeah that's basicallly it. In a nutshell, i was raised by a loving christian family and ended up becoming an atheist a year ago, without them knowing it. 
I love my family more than anything, and they help me a lot, my brother is like a father to me as he taught me a lot of the values i have today, in which some correlate to that of Stoicism.
But the problem is, i stopped believing in God. I am not seeking for religious advice or anything, because it just doesn't make sense to me in believing in a religion again, what i am struggling with is how to deal with it when it comes to my family. I know they would get sad and maybe even exclude me for it... I feel helpless because as far as i am concerned i am the only one in my family that doesn't believe in the religion and that makes me feel lonely and unmotivated.
Not only that, but oftentimes i feel like i am being too selfish, in the sense of ""They did everything to me and now you just leave everything"", specially towards my mom who struggled a lot to raise me.

I started keeping a journal of the worst things that happen to me every day.,"About a week ago, I started keeping a little journal on my notes app of the worst things that happened to me each day.


It has helped me to change the way I view things and to realize just how insignificant most of the little daily “evils” I encounter are. 


This is my list from the last few days:


MONDAY: broke the yolk of the egg I was cooking.

TUESDAY: stepped on some dog poop barefoot.

WEDNESDAY: woke up at 3:30 because my son was crying, couldn’t go back to sleep.

THURSDAY: son went to bed about an hour later than usual. 


This has helped me to stop catastrophizing a ton. I was grumpy all week. And the worst thing that happened was I lost some sleep and some free time and also stepped in poo. If that’s the worst thing that happens this week, fortune’s smiling on me. 


Of course, if I were to get fired, or have a loved one die, it would definitely be worse than those things, but it would likely help me appreciate the good days all the more. 


Try giving it a shot, you’ll likely find that most troubles are not of dire consequence.

Edit to add: I know I should have a stoic journal where I write about how I respond to situations, work on virtues, etc. That being said, I don’t have a ton of time, and this is definitely a 30-second exercise rather than even five minutes",Stoicism,1704491909.0,t3_18ziu36,0.83,14

A sadness and fear grows inside me as I grow older,"I'm 23 right now living in a third world country. When I see anime and other shows from well developed countries I see how thier lives are so much more fun than mine. The experiences these people had at their youth in their highschool and college, their interactions, their partying, and now as I'm getting older I will never be able to attain that lifestyle as I'm stuck in this country living a simple life in a simple culture. It's like I'm thinking that things that were supposed to happen didn't happen or something. I don't know how to process this or get over this feeling. I don't know what I want.

"""""Observe yourselves thus in your actions, and you will find to what sect you belong. ""","""Observe yourselves thus in your actions, and you will find to what sect you belong. You will find that most of you are Epicureans, a few Peripatetics, and those feeble. For wherein will you show that you really consider virtue equal to everything else or even superior? But show me a Stoic, if you can. Where or how? But you can show me an endless number who utter small arguments of the Stoics. For do the same persons repeat the Epicurean opinions any worse? And the Peripatetic, do they not handle them also with equal accuracy? who then is a Stoic? As we call a statue Phidiac, which is fashioned according to the art of Phidias; so show me a man who is fashioned according to the doctrines which he utters. Show me a man who is sick and happy, in danger and happy, dying and happy, in exile and happy, in disgrace and happy. Show him: I desire, by the gods, to see a Stoic. You cannot show me one fashioned so; but show me at least one who is forming, who has shown a tendency to be a Stoic. Do me this favour: do not grudge an old man seeing a sight which I have not seen yet. Do you think that you must show me the Zeus of Phidias or the Athena, a work of ivory and gold? Let any of you show me a human soul ready to think as God does, and not to blame either God or man, ready not to be disappointed about any thing, not to consider himself damaged by any thing, not to be angry, not to be envious, not to be jealous; and why should I not say it direct? desirous from a man to become a god, and in this poor mortal body thinking of his fellowship with Zeus. Show me the man. But you cannot. Why then do you delude yourselves and cheat others? and why do you put on a guise which does not belong to you, and walk about being thieves and pilferers of these names and things which do not belong to you?"" Discourses 2.19

Virtue is the only good. Not the reach for contentment.

We embrace/love/wish for whatever happens/has happened and do not worry so much about how other's define/label that. We are happy in whatever is going on because what does that have to do with our character?

We deal with life as it happens, and do not lose our way. This includes opinions, authors and ""sophists"" we do not agree with. As Epictetus and Seneca both share, we can objectively describe a thing for what it is, we observe that a course called ""The Wealthy Stoic"" sounds like a contradiction and a confusion, but it isn't Stoic to then assign that value to the person beyond that observation.

This is Stoicism. If this doesn't feel right, then maybe there is a false impression somewhere in there to work through, or maybe this isn't the philosophy your nature is set to follow?

"Stoicism does not advocate for abandoning emotions, but rather not giving unnecessary ones any of your time or energy correct?","I will confess that I get a bit bothered by the idea of people talking about me. I don’t hear my name come up much, but when I do it bothers me. 

What would stoicisms prescription be? To feel nothing about it at all? To feel something, but not let it affect my actions? To not even consider it in the first place?",Stoicism,1704489204.0,t3_18zhrqp,0.63,2
In love with an addict,"I'm in love with an addict, and I recently our relationship. When I broke up with him, I told him that part of the reason I was ending things was that I loved him too much to watch him kill himself. I was experiencing a lot of emotional distress because of his addiction and the way he was letting it impact his life and our relationship. He's a truly beautiful man, with a heart like none I've ever met and more love to give that I ever knew was possible, but was destroying his health and making it impossible to maintain a romantic relationship. 

From a Stoic perspective, I'm curious how to navigate our post-breakup friendship or whether I should not have one with him.  

Would growing as a Stoic mean learning to accept his self-destructive tendencies, and choose to serve as a support and friend if he chooses to get sober? Would it mean lovingly holding him accountable when he asks for support, and pointing out his patterns when he wants advice? 

Or would growing as a Stoic mean accepting that a leopard cannot change its spots, accepting that remaining in his life may be harming us both more than anything, and walking away? 

I will greatly appreciate any wisdom or experience this community has to share. ",Stoicism,1704486712.0,t3_18zgrmc,0.73,5

My plates arrived all broken,"I'm going to move out of my mother's house in July but have already started buying some things and keeping them stored. A week ago, I bought a set of 10 plates from a fancy store, I spent some amount of money on it but nothing out of my reality. 

Today, 5 out of the 10 plates arrived completely shattered inside the box. I was disappointed at first, but I didn't feel angry or upset... I sat down with my broken plates for a minute and contacted the store, so far they didn't reply (the store has a reputation of bad customer service). 

I'm thinking about just throwing the broken plates in the trash (carefully packed of course) and buy new ones soon from a different place.

Question concerning the Stoic view on abuse from family.,"
I have some issues with a stoic view on abusive family and I’m curious how you all interpret the passage. 

Very quick backstory: After years of therapy I’ve stopped speaking with my mother due to narcissism and abuse. 

Stoicism has been one of the most valuable things in my life and has helped me through so much. I have been very troubled upon a re-reading of Epictetus and would love your interpretation.

“Duties are universally measured by relations. Is a man a father? The precept is to take care of him, to yield to him in all things, to submit when he is reproachful, when he inflicts blows. But suppose that he is a bad father. Were you then by nature made akin to a good father? No; but to a father. Does a brother wrong you? Maintain then your own position toward him, and do not examine what he is doing, but what you must do that your will shall be conformable to nature. For another will not damage you, unless you choose: but you will be damaged then when you shall think that you are damaged. In this way then you will discover your duty from the relation of a neighbor, from that of a citizen, from that of a general, if you are accustomed to contemplate the relations.”

In the book A Field Guide to a Happy Life, Massimo Pigliucci’s rewrites Epictetus in more modern language. Here is another example of a stoic response to abuse from family.

“But,” you say, “my mother has been bad to me.” Perhaps, but she is your mother nevertheless, and you should concern yourself with how you behave toward her, not how she behaves toward you. “But my brother has done me some harm.” What do you mean, “harm”? Has he forced you to change your considered opinions or the values you endorse? No, he can’t do that. Then there is no real harm. He may have behaved unjustly toward you, but that is his business. Your business is to behave toward him by considering who he is: your brother.

So, after years of therapy, I have broken off my relationship with my mother. It was a very difficult decision but the correct choice. Reading these stoic passages that I have posted really upsets me. Does Epictetus really expect someone to allow pain and suffering inflicted upon them just because you are related to them? Standing up for ourselves and choosing not to be harmed is within our own power, so I had thought I made the stoic decision to choose not to be harmed anymore. Perhaps this passage from Epictetus is a relic of ancient times in which you could never sever ties with family regardless of the situation.

What do you think?",Stoicism,1704445748.0,t3_18z2mw3,0.73,5
Lost,"

So right now I(20m) am in my third year of college and honestly I have no idea what I’m doing as in I don’t know what to do with my life. The bachelor that I’m studying for now is biology not because I’m necessarily interested in it but because engineering is too hard for me considering I suck at math and political science is also uninteresting to me.
All throughout my life/high school people would ask me what I was going to study and I would always tell them “I didn’t know” thinking that eventually I would know and I could answer their question and my question but here I am and I still don’t know. I haven’t found anything that really interests me nothing to the extent I could see myself devoting time and effort into it. I play a lot of video games but I don’t like it enough for me to learn how to make a game and I watch a lot of movies and TV shows, but don’t like them enough to pursue a career in cinema for example and to top it all off I’m not good at anything(no talent,no secret hobbies,nothing). I’m trying not to sound ungrateful, but to put it simply nothing is ever enough It all feels empty to me. People have told me that it’s normal to be directionless in this stage in life and I understand that but at the same time is very frustrating seeing my friends in college just knowing what they’re going to do with themselves whether it be veterinarians, lawyers, programmers you name it and I wish I could be like them. Needless to say, this is all having a negative affect on me is bad enough to go through life’s struggles, but I would say its worse when you don’t have a “why” to your struggles. I don’t feel like I’m asking for too much when it comes to just knowing what I should do. I’m not asking for that perfect dream job. All I want is to know what I should be doing with my life, something that I can see myself doing for a long time and be good at it, and get meaning from it but I don’t have that and I need help. When somebody asks me, who am I, what are you doing and what am I going to do I want to actually give a real answer. So please advise and general thoughts about it would be greatly appreciated.",Stoicism,1704471679.0,t3_18zaq3a,0.6,1
A Stoic's Code of Conduct and how to achieve Emotional Maturity and/or remedy Emotional Immaturity.,"I've been practicing Stoicism for a couple of years now, and I do see some improvements. So I am not a newbie and I know better that Stoicism is not about repressing emotions.

Like many of us, my upbringing was not perfect (and I have stopped blaming my parents long ago), and I had a lot of ""issues"".  I have come a long way, I do live a ""normal"" life, dare to say ""happy""; some people would even use the term ""successful"" to describe my life and me.

But I am still working on myself, constantly improving.

Recently I am working on my latent internal anger, and I have come to the realization that I am still, probably, Emotionally Immature.

I have got some good comments on this sub recently on related matters, and I am journaling multiple times a day, reflecting on things, and challenging my own *intrusive thoughts* and also my *Belief System* (aka BS).

I have read multiple times Massimo Pigliucci's *How to be a Stoic*, and William Irvine's *A Guide to the Good Life*; they are book good in giving practical examples of Stoic life.

I am looking to make a simple ""Stoic's Code of Conduct"", a list so to speak that I can review multiple times a day, and in case of emergency, and therefore I am asking 2 questions:

1. Do you have such a list or can you point me to one?
2. Can you please review my incomplete list below, and suggest additions/edits?

TIA

My Stoic Code of Conduct:

* Speak positively.
* Don't be sarcastic (I used to do it too much).
* Never complain.
* Judge a situation or a behavior, not the person.  What someone does is not the reflection of who they are.
* Never say anything negative about anyone (linked to the item above), even if it's true (this is regarding work).
* Pursue the Stoic virtues (of course), always.
* Apply the dichotomy of control, always.
* Don't give into consumerism, lean toward minimalism.
* Journal daily: at night reflecting on the day that just ended; in the morning planning my day.
* Be mindful every moment.
* Pay special attention when interacting with people, be mindful.
* When the mind goes into a spiral down a rabbit hole; just stop.
* You can do it. Whether you think you can or you can't either way you're right.
* No gossips.
* No drama ever.",Stoicism,1704420924.0,t3_18yv8qn,0.88,11

Seneca on duties,"Seneca asserts, citing Democritus, that 'a relatively tranquil state of mind is only possible if we devote relatively little time to public or private affairs, or at least to those that are too great for our strength' in Book 3 Chapter 6 of 'On Anger'. He then goes on to suggest avoiding hunger, thirst, hard study or tasks

I was surprised by this. Having read the Meditations I had the impression that it was best to drive oneself strenuously into one's duties and enduring difficulties by accepting the present moment and modifying judgements. Seneca himself condemns laziness in his letters to Lucilius.

From what I understand Stoic logic was in some ways quite revolutionary and very distinct from some other ideas of the time (Aristotle being a prime example) and while no considerable body of work was preserved, what has been recorded is close to propositional logic which of course is very much in use in the modern age.

How to confront lies as a wise stoic? ( using what is within control and outside your control),"My freind and i made plans to buy somethings for her party. We already agreed on the day we were to go.

I then call a freind she lives with, the freind gives her the phone and my freind admits that shes already bought the stuff and shes been busy all day and didnt have time to reply or even call back. 

I know shes lying. In one of the messages i sent her, asking when she wants to go to buy her stuff, she diverts and asks a different question. It seems she was avoiding telling me, and im left wondering why. It seems she would have never admited shew has bought the stuff if i didnt gi the extra mile by calling her freind.  I am wondering why she didnt tell me shes already bought the stuff already. I know shes lying and i refuse to give benefit of doubt.

shes very arguementative and may not admit the lie. Confronting her may ruin the freindship, especially with her birthday coming up, it may be awkward if i attend.

Do i play dumb and not confront or calmly express that i feel she is lying? then slowly just avoid believeing her or trusting her in future.

A Life Direction through Determinism and Stoicism,"Some background: (skip if too long)

I'm 16, and lately I've been really struggling to do anything because of not knowing where I'm headed. It all began a few months ago. I was honestly really doing quite well, to which I mean I started being more responsible, disciplined and was focused on self-improvement. I slept and woke up early, took my studies seriously, did daily chores, etc.

I also journaled to write down my thoughts, which mostly consisted of how to improve myself and live better. On one of these journal sessions, I realized that my actions is mostly just problem solving. So I looked into how to problem solve. I read some stuff, and came to the conclusion that it simply boils down to: knowing WHAT to do, HOW to do that, and WHY do that. You might know where this is headed, but yeah, the ""WHY"" part really had me thinking. Why am I doing all this shit again? Why do I eat, sleep, study, have fun, and all the kit-and-caboodle?

So, naturally, I looked for an answer. If the question is ""why am I doing anything?"", then what I'm looking for is reason (or maybe purpose or meaning? idk I'm unsure still). I read about existentialism, absurdism, stoicism, and a few others, only enough to kinda get the gist of it, and I also did some personal thinking. This was where my mind has been for the past few months, and this lack of reason or direction or whatever, has really had me demotivated and depressed.

However, I think I've reached some sort of answer that I'm content with and I'd like to hear your thoughts about it.

&#x200B;

It goes as follows:

Determinism states that all actions and events result from other actions, events, or situations. The way I personally like to word this out is: ""what is"" determines ""what is to be"". ""What is"" simply refers to the state of stuff right now, and ""what is to be"" refers to how the state of how the stuff right now will be.

""What is"" includes me. What am I? What is the state of the stuff that is me right now? Well I am human. And a part of being human, of course, includes survival. But, it also includes the longing for happiness. And I personally think that the stoic philosophy of building character, having virtue as the goal, answers this longing for happiness.

What I'm essentially saying is: Stuff exists, and how these stuff exist, or ""what is"", determines how these stuff will exist, or ""what is to be"". A part of ""what is"" is what I am, and I am a human that longs for happiness among other things. This determines ""what is to be"", which includes my decisions and actions. Hence, I look for what'll bring me happiness, which I believe is found through the stoic philosophy.

(just to add, I recognize that determinism is usually brought up when discussing free will and responsibility, but here, I focus more on the idea it presents about how our actions is explicable by what we are and what other stuff are.)",Stoicism,1704420821.0,t3_18yv7e9,0.5,0
How to not judge people...,"How can I stop judging people?  
Just like today when test results came out and there were some people who got low scores despite the exams being easy (in my opinion). When I see their test results I just automatically judge them and think to myself that they probably dont do anything in their lifes but be on their phones all day and dont do anything to change or better themselves. 

I feel like just because I focus on self-improvement, I judge everyone else for not being the same as me, i have the same problems with other views in my life, like with atheism - i dont believe in any gods, and in my mind when i see someone fateful to god i just judge them about how theyre being stupid. I know its wrong to think this way, i never let these thoughts out on other people, but I acknowledge that my mind thinks this way, and i want to change it",Stoicism,1704364912.0,t3_18ya882,0.75,11

I have trouble understanding this passage in the passage before this one, he is talking about all the relations in the world and the Constitution of the human mind to receive impressions in and that this must be the work of a God. Then he ends the passage with the following

> ""let them explain what it is that bring all of this about, or how it is possible that such wonders that bear all the signs of workmanship come into being by chance and of their own accord""

I cant really put the passage \[12\] into relation to the End  I just quoted above. If you all would not mind to share your thoughts on this passage, and maybe if you think  it is meant to add to the passage from before.

"Anger, results and confusion","Ever been lied to? It's annoying, isn't it.

I feel like I've been lied to about a lot of things in my life. Most of them along the lines of ""Just do this and you'll be fine"". Well I did ""this"" and I wasn't fine. These were often people who had duty of care over me and I had little choice but to believe them and ironically were also the people who taught me that not telling the truth was a bad thing.

So deep down, I'm angry. At them for giving me instructions that lead nowhere, at me for being too weak or naive to get the results or to follow the instructions well enough.

If it weren't for that anger I would never have learned to stand up for myself when under attack, it has protected me. But in stoicism anger is never justified even if calmly explaining why someone hitting you should leave you alone is much less effective than striking back.

Issue with stoicism practices.,"I bought the handbook for new stoics, and have been working through it starting this year, I've already hit something of a road bump, the first exercise is to take an aspect of your day and seperate and examine what was and wasn't in my control, the issue I'm having is that I don't do much at all, I mostly stay inside, watching youtube or playing video games, I'm diabled and thus can't work.

So I don't really have an ascept of my day to examine, the book suggests things such as lunch with a friend or a work meeting, but I have nothing similar to those, the only thing I've been able to write about is my usage of social media, but if I use that as my example I'll be writting the same thing for each day of the week.

Bushido and Stoicism,"I’ve seen here several people mention how stoicism has similarities to some eastern philosophies. Before I discovered stoicism for myself, I studied the samurai. I wanted to know why they were portrayed as calm people in media and culture. This is one of my favorite quotes and I believe it fits the stoic goal of calmness. Perhaps even fear of death. This comes from Inazo Nitobe (1862-1933). He was born into the samurai class, but was 6 when it was abolished. His book, “The Way of the Samurai” is one of two books that most influences samurai media. That and the Hagakure. 

“The Way of the Samurai” Chapter 4: Courage, the Spirit of Daring and Bearing

“The spiritual aspect of valor, is evidenced by composure - calm presence of mind. Tranquility is courage in repose. It is a statical manifestation of valor, as daring deeds are dynamical. A truly brave man is ever serene; he is never taken by surprise; nothing ruffles the equanimity of his spirit. In the heat of battle he remains cool; in the midst of catastrophes, he keeps level his mind. Earthquakes do not shake him, he laughs at storms. We admire him as truly great, who, in the menacing presence of danger, or death, retains his self possession; who, for instance, can compose a poem under impending peril, or hum a strain in the face of death. Such indulgence betraying no tremor in the writing, or in the voice, is taken as an infallible index of a large nature - what we call a capacious mind, which, far from being pressed or crowded, has always room for something more”

Is the first step to forgiving someone that you perceived wronged you to control your thoughts or your actions?,"There is someone who in the past hurt me. A family member.

I realize now that she did not injure me in anyway. The things she said that were true I had no right to be upset about and the things that were false equally were unimportant.

I’m deeply afraid of strangers and people in general, and I hate to socialise with others, and crowds and noise.

I’m trying to improve, today I saw a homeless and deaf man so I gave him a bit of cash but later on on a restaurant when another homeless person approached me I got afraid of them and ignored them, but the family right next to me invited them to the table and feed them, and I felt like the biggest piece of garbage ever.

In order to be a good and just person should we correct lies we have told or bad actions we have done even if they will hurt the person?,"In an attempt to be a better person I am trying to right things I have done in the past and be an honest person in general. 

For example, in a joint business in the past I was under reporting revenue and over reporting expenses in order to pocket more of the profit. To right this wrong I have a cheque written for the difference to give to my partner. My question now arises in if I should tell him that I was stealing from him all this time. 

As I am someone he trusts immensely this would upset him and I am doing it to make myself feel better. 

I could alternatively lie and say ""I found some mistakes in the numbers, looks like you're owed this much more"". 

Is lying to make him feel better a stoic action?

I've analyzed this situation and I am not scared to tell him that I betrayed his trust. I am able to accept any fall out from it. I would obviously prefer to have him in my life as I consider him a friend but that is a decision I think he should make, not me. 

I feel as though I am starting to ramble now so I will stop shortly. 

I compared the situation to if I was told by a recent ex she was cheating on me the entire relationship. I would feel upset over that and think that it was unnecessary to tell me this additional information after we had broken up. 

The business is still running and I stopped playing with the numbers recently. 


This also made me wonder if we should go out of our way to correct any lies or misinformation we have given people or to just be honest going forward.

Shaving your beard,"Please excuse the paraphrasing, I do not have my copy with me.

Epictetus says that if one is to practice philosophy, their conviction should be such that they are willing to lose their head if another demands they behave in a manner contrary to their philosophy. This is conveyed early on in the discourses in a metaphor about shaving one's beard.

He also says that one should not try to pursue causes that are out of one's control, because not only will one disgrace themselves in doing this, they will have abandoned a pursuit in which they could have performed well. This is from enchiridion 37.

A topical example is a hypothetical US citizen that believes that US aid to Israel is cruel. This citizen decides to not pay their taxes, in accordance with their philosophy. But then they are jailed, preventing them from the good they could have done while not jailed, and Israel still receives the aid because there are hundreds of millions of tax paying citizens. 

Quote 2 implies it is a better idea to just follow the law and pay the taxes. Quote 1 implies that we should not care for the consequences.

Am I misunderstanding? Is there a discourses chapter that elaborates on enchiridion 37?

I made an inappropriate joke to someone and their reply was hurtful. How do I subvert my expectations of being apologized to?,"This is a fake scenario based off of a real problem I'm having.

I'm confused in how to feel and how to respond to they way someone reacted to a joke I made.

So let's say I, Jack, made a joke about vegans to my friend Mark, who is not a vegan but has told me previously that they don't like jokes at the expense of vegans.

After telling my joke, Mark said ""shut up, that's offensive"".

Now, upon reflection I realized that I made a mistake. There's no doubt in my mind that the initial mistake was mine. However I still feel hurt due to being told to shut up.

I have apologized for making the joke, and Mark hasn't apologized for his response. I feel like I expect him to apologize. Should I not?

This is something which isn't yet clear to me in the stoic teachings. I lack ""the wisdom to know the difference"". I know his apology is out of my control, but should (or could) I tell him that it was hurtful and that I would like if he doesn't do it again?

Contradictory quotes?,"Dear Posse.

Does ugliness rub off?  Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius seem to disagree, or can Marcus Aurelius’ words be interpreted into “ugliness will only rub off, if you let it”?

“Avoid fraternizing with non-philosophers [i.e., people who don’t try to improve themselves]. If you must, though, be careful not to sink to their level; because, you know, if a companion is dirty, his friends cannot help but get a little dirty too, no matter how clean they started out.”

Epictetus, Enchiridion 33.6

And 

“When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they can't tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are unnatural.”

The Praxis of Developing a Stoic Mindset - How can we actually start to think and behave Stoically? Here are my thoughts on concrete steps to take to begin moving towards the Stoic ideal.,"# Introduction

It's not secret that as this subreddit has grown, a large number of the topics are people seeking Stoic advice. A lot of these posts are however misguided in a way - they seem to be  looking for a particular kind of solution that you might find in an algebra problem. They want something that they can plug into the equation to solve for X, and thus find a neat and tidy answer to their problem - whether that's a broken heart, the effects of childhood trauma, or disappointment at their lack of self-perceived accomplishment in their lives. Stoicism is not a framework for solving for a particular value of X. It is rather a way of deconstructing the problem such that you realize looking for X is the wrong approach entirely. 

The suffering that people describe as stemming from various events (my romantic partner left me, I feel empty and defeated) is the categorical mistake that Stoicism seeks to address. It is a radical and revolutionary reframing of the human experience that begins with the detachment of human value judgment from the events and consequences that are happening every second of our lives. In simple terms, Stoicism would say that the breaking of your relationship is not the source of your suffering, but your impression of it is. If you broke off an abusive relationship and were now freed from violence and oppression, you would see the end of a relationship as liberation. It is your impression and interpretation of the event which creates the condition of pleasure/pain in your mind. And so Stoicism stretches that to almost every single thing that we experience, and demands that we detach from judging things to be good or bad so that we are not living our lives at the mercy of chance and fortune. Virtue is the sole good, and our virtue can never be affected by anything that happens to us, including physical pain, destitution or death. This is of course simplistic, but I wanted to set the stage with a broad overview before getting to the point of this post, which is:

# **How do I *actually* start thinking and acting Stoically?**

**The first step in developing a Stoic mindset is to develop the habit of having structured reflection about yourself and your life.** This means not only thinking about what you are doing and how you are living, but taking active steps such as journalling, and structured review of your thoughts/actions which you revisit later on. The process of putting thoughts into writing forces you to order them and clarify them. Pure mental thinking is ultra-high bandwidth with tons of noise and emotional baggage that cloud the ideas, whereas writing is a kind of structured thinking that forces you to crystallize your innumerable thoughts, and serves as a record for your future self. Its hard to remember what you were thinking about even a week ago, and it's imperative to have a handle on the evolution of your thinking and feeling. 

So if you are at a loss at where to start, start writing daily. Write about your life and your thoughts every single day. What is happening and what is your judgment of what is happening? What do you want? What do you feel is missing? Alongside this, pick a Stoic text and begin reading it. Don't worry about commentary, just read it for yourself first. Slowly, you will see themes from Stoic texts crop up in your life. Reflect on them - are they applicable? Do you agree with the author? Do you find the ideas persuasive or do you disagree with them? Explain yourself and your thinking. Later on, return to your writing and see if your mind is changing. You will be shocked at what you wrote 1 month ago, 6 months ago, etc. It will be a sign of your progress, and this is critical because Stoicism is a journey of self-mastery, and of self-responsibility. It is imperative you keep a written record. 

# **I'm already reading and journalling - what now?**

Our goal is of course to begin changing our minds, and that means achieving some kind of control over our reactions in real-time. In my view, the critical step is looking to carve a space between **action** and **reaction** in the course of our lives. At first, there is no space - we can only reflect on things hours or days afterwards. But as we continue the process of reflection and meditation, it finally happens - we get a brief flash of space between an event and our impression of it. An example from my own life might look like this:

> *Here is a typically angering situation for me. I can see it unfolding. This is a huge inconvenience to me. This person is completely disrespecting me and my time. I feel my blood pressure rising and my emotions lifting. I want to show my anger to this person, but I know I will regret it later. *

And I would still react angrily. I would say something disrespectful back, raise my voice, and lose control of myself. But still - I had time enough to have the above discourse in my mind. I could recognize it all happening, and I still couldn't control it, **but this is the first victory.** I could see the impression forming. And so then you reflect on the fact that you are starting to see the impression forming, you write about it in your journal. And then it happens again. And again. And you fail again. But then one time you catch yourself and actually manage to shift your reaction a tiny bit. You curb your anger. You take a few breaths and instil calmness into the situation. You are still angry but you're doing better this time. It takes less time for you to cool off after. And afterwards when you journal, you realize that this is the first time you've ever been able to stop yourself before fully engaging in the emotional reaction.

We see posts like these on here as well ""Stoic success stories"" - small but important anecdotes where people relay a situation where they caught themselves about to react badly, and asserted control. These victories stem from the earlier step of creating that tiny space.

As you continue to pile up these 'victories', you assert more and more control over your reactions. In your reflections, you begin to truly understand that when people are being rude or disrespectful to you, it is a reflection of their own hardships and ignorance, and nothing to do with you. You start to truly understand that getting angry is handing ownership of your mind to another, usually a complete stranger, who has already forgotten about you while you are still brewing with rage from your interaction with them. And so it becomes more and more natural to simply not react in these situations. 

# The key is to keep it in mind

The general theme here is that in order to begin to think Stoically, you need REMINDERS to do so. You need some kind of process that injects the Stoic principles back into the active thinking patterns and not just the passive ones that are occurring in times of acute pain. I think for most people, that has to begin with active, regular journalling and reading the Stoic texts. The more you think and write on them, the more they will be in your mind. And the more they are in your mind, the faster you will finally achieve that first 0.01 seconds of space between action and reaction, and then that space will continue to get bigger as you gain control over your emotions and cognition. As you gain control, you start to actually see the process almost from a third person perspective. This creates the conditions for further control, for more space, and the process continues and you can sink deeper into the true Stoic mindset.

As you go further, you are not simply getting better at calming down - you are starting to see the events for what they are, and they lose the ability to affect you in the first place. You actually begin to understand implicitly, not just logically, the foundational truth of the Stoic mindset. The logical understanding of Stoic ideas is not enough - 99.9% of you understand them already, but that doesn't magically change your mind. You need repetitions and practice so that your brain grasps it on an emotional level as well. Over time, you are seeing the problem differently - there is no X to solve.",Stoicism,1704132452.0,t3_18w2gxi,0.96,61
What things are determine what things do. Is this true? What does stoicism have say to this?,"Here's the gist:

* Wise 16 year old gains consciousness 
* Doesn't know why he does what he does.
* Wonders ""what am I doing?"" and ""why am I doing it?
* What SHOULD I do and why SHOULD I do that?
* Wants a clear life direction.
* Tries to figure it out for months.
* Can't figure it out. Isn't satisfied with any answer. Finds despair instead.
* Has trouble doing anything cause of not knowing why he does what he does, or for that matter, why does ANYTHING at all do what they do?
* Reaches some sort of conclusion, which he still doesn't find satisfying so then asks reddit cause doesn't know where else.

~~~

The conclusion:

- Things just exists.
- These things exist in certain ways.
- The ways that these things exist can change.

This is reality.


What things are determine what things do, and what things do determine what things are to be.

ie. What a thing is and what surrounds that thing (the universe/ the earth/ society) determines what it does, and what it does determines what it becomes and what surrounds it becomes. 


If this is true, then:

What to do?
What you do is determined by what you are and what other things are.

Why do that?
What is done is done because of what you are and what other things are.

~~~

So is it that simple? I wake up, I eat, I bathe, I study, I draw, I choose a goal, I love, I survive etc. all because of what I am and what surrounds me? Is it logical?

Trouble with knowing which emotions are reasonable,"First: I mention some heavy thoughts, but I am in no active danger, so please don’t report this. I am in therapy, but I also want some logical input, because rationalising thoughts helps me. Thank you. 
 ———

To make it brief - I know that the right mindset can change *a lot*. That is what I struggle with the most, right after controlling my emotions (as in, not letting them control me). 


I am in therapy and have also started recently mood stabilisers, as my psych thinks the intensity of my emotions is not normal. But obviously I still need to work in therapy on actively calming myself and changing my mindset. I’m doing CBT which overlaps a lot with Stoicism. 


So:  I’ve struggled hard with guilt, shame, and as a result suicidal ideation for years. I often want to open up to my family about it, but I’ve been told even just breaking into tears over small disagreements is me being “manipulative”.  No words can convince my father otherwise, not even from my therapist. So just the idea of being vulnerable to my father (who has plenty reasons to be disappointed by and angry with me, as he is) and telling him “I don’t want to be alive anymore. And I feel guilty that I know I won’t ever attempt suicide because I believe it would be better for you. But I am too selfish even for that.” is terrifying. Not to be able to tell your own parent you wish to stop living, because you are used to negative responses to opening up, is so painful and invalidating. I don’t want pity from him, I want empathy and to feel loved. My suicidal ideation is real, and I need help. But it doesn’t go away from one therapy session, and I think beging honest about how you feel is important for well being. So not being able to be honest with my own father is… I am repeating myself. 


But is it “reasonable” or “okay” to feel sad that I can’t tell own father how I feel? Can I tell him anyway because it weighs so heavily on me, or should I keep it between myself and my therapist? Because isn’t the **reason** I’m sad that I care what he thinks? Is it “reasonable” in Stoicism that I want to trust and be loved by my parent, to want empathy from him? Or should I work on not caring what he thinks, because then, well, then I won’t let myself be controlled by my wish to get love from him? 


I am at a loss. To not care what my own father thinks of me seems so so cold and irresponsible. I am scared that if I don’t care what he thinks of me, I will might behave in ways that hurt him. 


But then, if he feels hurt, wouldn’t that be his responsibility and because of his mindset? 
But that sounds even colder. 


I don’t know what to think. I just want to be happy, and the man who said I need to ask for help more doesn’t understand that the best way for *him* to help me is to be empathetic.",Stoicism,1704150312.0,t3_18w9k4u,0.83,8

How to maintain relationship with parents while keeping my peace?,"Sorry, it might feel like a rant, but I don't know how to summarize what goes in my mind.

I ooz hate/anger in my head when I speak to my parents when they ask me to do things certain way. I usually listen for one or two times, and then in straight words, I tell them that I dont want to live that particular way  but if they want to, then it is their choice. My father  just switches the topic or hands over the phone to my mom. One time, when I recommended something then my mom said that she would listen from one ear and let it out from other. 

Part of me doesn't want to have any relationship with them, and the other part is like that they are growing old and live thousands of kilometers away.

2yrs ago, I stopped sharing my life with them over our daily calls unless it impacts them in some way. I really dont say much. I just listen to what they have to say about their life and leave it at it. This is out of respect what they have gone through to support me in whatever way, and I know they didnt have it easy.

However, I can't deny I question my choice to call them every single day because for them it doesn't matter as it's part of living life and I overthink. After all this, they try to associate with me, and I have noticed myself being instantly repellant to that association as I don't want to be like my parents.

People thinking I don't care,"Happy New Year all,

In practicing emotional control and not immediately reacting to a negative situation, has anyone else run into other people thinking you don't care?

Take for example, if a significant issue or mistake occured at work, I used to overreact to show coworkers and management how much I cared, but I eventually realized this caused me too much mental distress, and was not worth it in the grand scheme of life, it's just a job.

Since becoming a practicing stoic, I am getting the impression from others that my calm/indifferent reaction to situations makes them think I don't care, which is an issue concerning I am in management. 

Has anyone else run into this? My thought is my mental well being is more of a priority than what some boss might think of my level of engagement, and that an employer having an issue with your calmness probably isn't one to stay with.

Fearless, we welcome whatever paths the dark side sets us on,  and whatever destiny it lays out for us.”

\-*Darth Plagueis*, James Luceno

Yeah i know star wars is silly, but these quotes are the kind of thing that make me question some stoic principles.

Marcus Aurelius wrote to himself ""If it is endurable, then endure it. Stop complaining."" but isn't complaining a natural human response to stress? An stoic can even fool himself thinking that he can endure everything ""endurable"" only to snap like a brittle twig at some point.

Isn't having hope and goals two of the most powerful driving forces in humans? Yet stoicism says hope is the twin brother of fear. And even fear can keep living beings alive, same with anger and stubbornness. An stoic that forsakes these emotions may never know his true potential or know his true self.",Stoicism,1704157061.0,t3_18wc4tc,0.67,3
Are there any online Stoicism courses worth doing?,"I’m new to this and I want to understand and learn how to apply Stoicism to my life as fast as possible.

I’m wondering if there’s any highly regarded online courses, or the best way to learn Stoicism is still to read and attempt to practice what I read in daily life.

Nature Paradox,"Would it be fair to affirm that a pillar of stoicism is acting in accordance with nature?

If so, why isn’t stoicism more prevalent?  Isn’t human nature just what humans are, which is non-stoic by and large?

Just making my way through the discourses again, and this is just a question that came up for me so far.

I also don’t know how related this is to determinism.   Like, if stoicism leans deterministic, how can we reconcile the dichotomy of control?

On discussing other people,"An excerpt from Simplicius’ commentary on *Enchiridion* 33 follows this chunk:

> But above all things take care not to talk of other People, neither so as to censure their Conduct, nor to be lavish in their Commendation, nor to make invidious Comparisons between one and another.

The commentary: 

> But above all things, he gives us warning not to entertain our selves, and our Company with talking of other People; neither so as to call their Behaviour to Account, nor to be profuse in their Praises, nor free in making Comparisons between one Man and another, as That this Lady is handsomer than That, or this Man Braver, or Honester than That, or the like. Now there is nothing more evident, than that this Topick does in a more than ordinary manner divert the Soul from its self, and its own Business; for it makes Men busie, and curious, and impertinent, extreamly inquisitive, and troublesome where they have nothing to do. But why should this (you'll say) do so more than any other? And what can our talking of other Men have in it worse than the Subjects mentioned before?

> To this we may reply, That the Person to whom the Advice is here directed, being one who hath made some progress in Philosophy, as not so likely to entertain himself with those trivial Matters, as with something that relates to Mankind, and their Affairs and Actions. So that it was convenient to draw him off from those things especially, which his own Inclina∣nations would most dispose him to; and there∣fore he adds that Emphatical Caution, But above all things.

> Besides, though it be true, That the same Affections are stirred in us by both Discourses a∣like, (for we are insensibly drawn in to love and hate things and Men by talking of them) yet there is one peculiar Vice attends our Conver∣sation, when we pretend to give Characters of other people; which is, That it strangely swells one with Vanity and Pride, and Contempt of others. For whoever he be that pretends to sit in Judgment upon other Mens Conduct, does it out of some imagined Excellence in himself, which he fansies gives him a Right to arraign his Neighbours. And besides, any mistake in our Judgments of Men, is more inexcusable, and of infinitely worse Consequenee than if we pro∣nounce wrong in those other trifling Matters; and therefore we should be very sparing and tender in this Point.

Reflecting on Ryan,"I was blown away when someone on this subreddit pointed out to me that Ryan Holiday's debasement of this philosophy has reached the point of him creating a site called ""[The Wealthy Stoic](https://www.thewealthystoic.com/)"" to openly shill Stoicism as a get-rich-quick scheme.

For years I have been telling people his approach is a poorly disguised get-rich-quick scheme. What he's done has taken all of the cleverness out of that observation - now anyone with eyes can make that observation, which makes me feel a lot less original (and that could be a good thing).

It doesn't anger me when I look at the ""Wealthy Stoic""; the feeling is more like bemusement. Stoicism is exactly the opposite of what he's selling - it's just remarkable that he's chosen such a staunchly ascetic philosophy as his basis for selling people their own greed back to them. Perhaps wrapping one thing up in the other somehow makes the grift more effective.

As the new year rolls in and I start moving towards my fifth year of Stoic practice, it's somewhat interesting to reflect on the fact that feeling as though Ryan Holiday was trying to scam me is what initially sent me to Epictetus, and learning from Epictetus is what unlocked the benefits of the philosophy for me. I had just started recovering from my drug addiction, and I was reading The Daily Stoic and another one of his books (possibly ""The Obstacle is the Way"" but I cannot quite recall). As I read I got the distinct sense that I was reading trite garbage attached to a sales funnel by a person who didn't *really* care for their subject matter, and who was disturbingly enamored with extremely wealthy people who had diddly-squick to do with Stoic philosophy. Feeling certain there must be more value to the philosophy than what I was being given, I googled something like ""who is the most respected Stoic"" and was directed to Epictetus. I purchased my Penguin Classics copy of the Discourses (Kindle edition of course - I wanted to start immediately) and I never looked back.

I can recall an overwhelming sense of joy and relief when I realized that not only was the philosophy far from the trite, vague nonsense Holiday was portraying it as, but I was reading one of the most profound forms of thought I'd ever seen written down - a distillation of all the wisdom I'd acquired in beating my addiction, plus a cognitive mountain of completely verifiable and entirely unique claims about the mind that I'd never have been able to come up with on my own, and which I now use every single day when reasoning about how to live my life. 

I live an honest life. I feel happy - I feel like I never lack courage and that I do not need to lie to anyone. I have a wife I love and I'm content with what I have - truly content, as in if I had my current circumstance for the rest of my life I'd die happy. Better yet, if every single object I owned were lost in some freak accident tomorrow, I'm fairly sure I'd be no less content - I might need a week to get my bearings, I'm far from a Stoic sage after all, but I doubt I'd need much more than that. 

It's strange to feel that way, and to have felt such a profound benefit from the practice of this philosophy, only to then see the person I once thought of as its titan looking haggard and exhausted, shilling get-rich-quick schemes on a scammy-looking website. It drives home a point the Stoics make themselves - that the wealth and power of the Emperor counts for nothing. To Ryan Holiday, Stoic philosophy is nothing but a way to grift - like any criminal, he makes his money robbing the unaware and scamming the credulous. To me, the philosophy taught me how to be happy. When I help people to understand Stoicism I don't do it for money, and I get to feel honest at the end of it, something I suspect Ryan Holiday hasn't felt about himself in a very long time.

Happy 2024 everyone. Let's all try to surpass Ryan Holiday this year. ",Stoicism,1704068442.0,t3_18vkufu,0.92,82
Re-reading Epictetus. General tips?,"Cyberstoa:

I read Epictetus once months ago.  I don’t seem to have gotten much out of it.  There was lots going on in my life, so it could have been for a number of reasons.

It appears, however, that Stoicism is a philosophy/practice that might help me live a “better” life.  I keep being told on this sub that to understand Stoicism I need to at least start with understanding Epictetus.

To that end, I will begin re-reading it.  Something like a chapter a day.

Hello everyone. Needed some information and guidance from fellow stoicists. Would mean a lot to me.,"It's gonna be pretty unorganised so please bear with me.

My first point of concern is if I am doing something wrong or harming myself in any way by studying and applying stoicism?? That's my biggest concern right now. I am reading stoicism a lot and it has brought to me a lot of changes. I need to know if I am setting myself up for some bad outcome.

Here's some changes that I have observed after starting stoicism.

1. I have stopped getting post jut clarity. I know it sounds silly but it's a major concern for me. I used to have post nut clarity for when I used to feel low or needed to clear my mind. Now I can't. But I do get some resemblance of post nut clarity when I am reading stoicism. So I don't really know if that's a good thing or bad thing.


2. I have become way better in making friends. Earlier I used to have trouble getting respect from people now I am doing good not as much as I would like but far better than earlier. But I think I have lost my charming capabilities too. Earlier I could enjoy parties and be fun there too. Now I just dont see any point in parties. Everytime I see someone enjoying parties and getting out of control, I start judging them which is a wrong thing.


3. My other concern is that girls don't follow stoicism and it makes me prone to getting cheated on. Somehow I can't shake the feeling that getting complacent and indifferent leads to your partner getting a free hand and cheating on you.


4. I would really appreciate a mentor who has been actively practicing stoicism for a long time now.

Holiday's Influence,"Just thought I'd mention this since I've been seeing some posts about ryan holiday. 

I've seen Stoics here mentioned that despite the twisted and misconstrued picture holiday paints about Stoicism, many people end up finding true Stoicism. Therefore, holiday may not be doing too much harm, but rather a benefit to people. 

I'd like to challenge that by telling my experience. 

I first heard of Stoicism in college, around 2016. I don't recall if it was on a podcast or a YouTube video or an article, but I came across holiday talking about the Meditations and Marcus Aurelius and Stoicism. 

And when I heard him, I easily saw he was just talking bullshit. And I completely disregarded Stoicism too. 

Fast forward, I graduated and got a job in finance in 2018. And one day while at a colleagues desk, I noticed he had the Meditations of Aurelius. This seemed to me to be a confirmation of what holiday was selling: Stoicism as some broski, hustle, self help bullshit that would be big with finance bros (like my colleague).

Of course I was wrong to associate Marcus Aurelius and Stoicism with holiday's bullshit. It wasn't until this year that I really got into Stoicism. And in all of those years, I didn't give Stoicism a chance because I (erroneously) associated Stoicism with bullshit self help. 

To be fair to me though, (and my point), holiday, in my experience, did not only not lead me to Stoicism, but also contributed to the impression that Stoicism was just a bunch of hustle culture self help bullshit. 

I could only speculate how better my life would have been had I given Stoicism a chance and read the Discourses. But that's futile. 

So just as holiday might help bring people to Stoicism, he might also help people push Stoicism away. And so, in this way, holiday might not be helping people. 

What's left for us is to simply guide people away from holiday and redirect them to Stoicism.",Stoicism,1704097173.0,t3_18vsd29,0.69,6

Stoic values and Career,"I recently began reading a translation of Epictetus’ works. In one part of it, he says it is better to be poor and starve to death in tranquility than to live anxiously in abundance. He also says “you can always win competitions in which winning is up to you”.

Responsibilities,"I know that the idea of control is talked about to excess. What I can control what I can't control what I should try to control or other misunderstandings. I don't like the word control and I personally think it's a bad translation of the concept. 

Isn't it more productive to instead concentrate on what our responsibilities are? That's a much easier question to answer. What is your responsibility and what isn't your responsibility? Are you properly accepting responsibility for the things you say and do? 

Some things are our responsibility and some things aren't. Trying to accept responsibility for the actions and reactions of others does a disservice to them as maybe they're supposed to be learning a lesson. Trying to make someone else responsible for my actions and reactions does me a disservice because it removes my opportunities to learn and grow.

Today I went from being right to being wrong. So much for my Stoicism practice.,"Today I was wronged. Someone did something.

I remedied, took matters into my own hands, and with effort and work, I remedied someone's malice or stupidity (Occam's razor).

Stoicism teaches us: 

* I did well. I used wisdom, courage, and justice.
* Now move on, continue to practice virtues, and - why not - do great things with your life.
* It's all done and over with.

But I had to confront that person, ask them why they did what they did. They lied and turned things around, accusing me of not telling the truth. So not only they wrong edme, but now they were trying to do the switcharoo on me? And falsely accusing me?

I tried to reason with them, nope, there was no way. I distanced myself and I reported to their company.  Then, later on, on my way out, I picked up the conversation again, which continued on the same note; till I lost my temper.

So, from being on the right side of the fact I become the villain. I was, the a-hole.

And this is where Stoicism is correct:

* What had happened (when the person wronged me) was outside my control.
* I was able to control some actions that I took to remedy.
* The entire event, now in the past, is 100% outside my control. There's nothing that I can do to undo what was done. Stoicism teaches me to do nothing, because there's nothing to be done. That is the wise thing to (not) do, that is the just thing do to, that would be a manifestation of moderation.

The actions that I took instead, the things I said, the letting my anger take over losing my cool were my doing, I did that, I allowed that, I went into the rabbit hole and continued to go down.

And now I can't sleep (ruminating) and I have been re-living those events for the past few hours. What a waste of life.

Now more than ever I see how the Stoic teaching are correct, always seek to be virtuos, by practicing wisdom, justice, courage, and moderation.

And by distinguishing what is within our control and what is not; and act accordingly.

And to be aware of impressions, since:

> We form our judgments and opinions based on what the Stoics called “impressions.” In broad terms, all stimuli (and our unthinking interpretations of them) are impressions.

Today was an opportunity for me to practice Stoicism at its best. If I had done that it would have been very low effort, just ""doing nothing"" really. I could have moved on with my life, doing something productive in the past few hours, and by now I would be sleeping like a baby.

My life is indeed the summation of the choices that I make, and Stoicism is a great co-pilot, if I choose to follow its advice. Everything that matters is 100% within my control. What is not doesn't really matter.",Stoicism,1704003082.0,t3_18v16fa,0.94,15

I struggle a lot with internalizing stoicism.,"As a on and off practitioner of a few years, I understand Stoicism in theory, but I find that knowing something consciously doesn’t necessarily result in it having any effect beyond that.

Making a fool of myself drunk,"Hello guys! I have a problem. I often binge drink when I go outside. Week ago I was at a concert and I made a complete fool of myself. I was flaling down, flerting with many guys, kissed one qho has really bad reputation. I was looking horrible. Problem is that I knew all of the people there and now I am really embarrassed because of it all. I oftent drink that much because of a social anxiety. I can't focus so much on other things when I am alone, it has been a week and I still feel like shit. I am old enough (33) that I don't wanna do this things no more. But it just happens. I often think about quitting alcohol. But I don't know if I can do it for a longer period of time. I pretty much have good things in my life going on. Good job, great close friends, I am healthy, but this is the thing that I cannot stop. I am a great person when I don't drink. I am acting horrible sometimes when I do.

This is not a test. This is the real thing.

When your 40 minute drive becomes two hours or your spouse uses more plates and forks than they need and it's your turn to do the dishes or a non-human animal under your care needs to shit some time around 4 am and you always prefer it be outside of the house so you wake up your brain, raise your body temperature a bit and go outside, sometimes you find yourself contorted.
All tied up in a knot for the duration of the bad thing. You're annoyed or angry. You wish to be in a different mental state.

Ask yourself:

Is this not life? In these moments when my (probably not deeply thought out) immediate preferences aren't met, can I not be satisfied? Can I only be satisfied if what I think I want is what I get? No. That seems like asking for trouble. Pre-meditated suffering. 
If I can learn to enjoy traffic then I'll always be satisfied.

My goal is to go from 
""oh, no. There is heavy traffic. My will and desires have been thwarted by circumstance. I will now lament what I cannot have"" 
to 
""I see that there is heavy traffic. I know that this is always possible. It only means that it will take more time to put my body where I want it to be. Good thing I am protected from the elements, robbers and great distances in my private metal box. It's not what I wanted, but these moments are also my life. I will not spend them lamenting or wanting anything other than what I get. At that point, it's too late to get otherwise. Accept the consequences at once so you can relax your breathing, straighten out your spine and focus on finding pleasure or contentness in the places you're not paying attention to. If you don't accept it, the consequences will still happen. You'll just be miserable and it'll be your own fault""",Stoicism,1703961546.0,t3_18umci1,0.75,7

two incidents made me this ask the question. seeing homeless person and another who is suffering from toxic relationship.

whenever I see homeless person, I feel terrible and physical unease. I usually see on shopping street or when I come out from eating at restaurant, which means I also feel guilty for spending money. (but you can't live without doing that) I don't spend on unnecessary things and don't eat at fancy places, I am still a college student and don't eat out often and most expensive meal I had on my own is $12 and that too twice or thrice a year.  But when I eat I usually see homeless person as I walk home from that place. I donate change I have but still I feel almost depressed. q's like Do I deserve the nice food I just had? why is that person suffering in cold outside but I go to nice, warm house? 


I am aware of very close person I know who suffered domestic abuse and had their life turned upside down, their religious family recognize the abuse but don't want them to divorce. 

after becoming aware of such things I become sad and it feels bad to do things I do and indulge in which are not necessary but essential to get on with my life.

"""Isn't the foolishness of a few a more precious commodity than the wisdom of the masses?""-Fate Zero","Gilgamesh: I am fond of lives of hubris. People who harbor grand ambitions without realizing that they are unequal to the task. The mere sight of such people gives me great enjoyment. There are two kinds of arrogance. One where you are unequal to the task and one where your dreams are too big. The former is common place stupidity...but the later is a rare species that is difficult to find.

Kirei: But they are identical in that they are both fools, are they not?

Gilgamesh: Isn’t the foolishness of a few a more precious commodity than the wisdom of the masses?There are those who were born human but harbor wishes that man was not meant for...and have renounced their humanity in its pursuit. I never grow weary of watching their grief and despair. Kirei, what of you?(dialogue from fate zero)

When I read alittle about Gilgamesh, the story says he wished to become a God, one of the Gods. To which the gods agreed, giving him a series of trials which if he passed, he would become a God. One of them involved staying up without sleep for seven days and seven nights which he failed. So in that paragraph where he ""never grows weary of watching grief and despair"", he's engaging in abit of Schadenfreude against himself and all like him. The Stoic sage is an ideal, obtainable? I don't know, but would the stoic sage be considered a human or a God?, a God I think. So isn't it's pursuit a form of renouncing one's humanity on some level? Plato's philosopher king encourages himself  in  his Meditations to ""stick to what seems right""(the best goal to achieve, the one we fall short of when we fail), and to ""celebrate behaving like a human being, however imperfectly"". Well, I feel like we should have a Stoic Failure Story tag to encourage empathy, vulnerability and authenticity even further in this community.

 Arthur Koestler theorized that; when children are impersonating adults, a comedian is impersonating a public figure, men are disguised as women and women are disguised as men. The impersonater is perceived as himself and as somebody else at the same time. That while this situation lasts, ""the two matrices are bissociated in the spectators mind. And while his intellect is capable of swiftly oscillating from one matrix to the other and back, his emotions are incapable of following these acrobatic turns. They are spilled into the gutters of laughter as soup is spilled on a rocking ship. Here I am thinking about Chrysipuss, who Seneca believed ""saw the very bottom of truth"" dying of laughter. Koestler further adds that ""we are literally ""poisoned"" by our adrenal humours, reason has little power over irritability or anxiety. It takes time to talk a person out of a mood, however valid the argument;passion is blind to better judgment; anger and fear show physical after affects long after their causes have been removed. If we could change our moods as quickly as we jump from one thought to another, we would be acrobats of emotion"". And I'm not sure why but this brings to mind Arriana Huffington's quote, ""sleep is a feature of the human operating system, not a bug"". Which is why Gilgamesh probably failed to become a God. ""But what says Zeus? ""Epictetus, if it were possible, I would have
made both your little body and your little property free and not
exposed to hindrance. But now be not ignorant of this: this body is
not yours, but it is clay finely tempered. And since I was not able to
do for you what I have mentioned, I have given you a small portion
of us, this faculty of pursuing an object and avoiding it, and the
faculty of desire and aversion, and, in a word, the faculty of using
the appearances of things; and if you will take care of this faculty
and consider it your only possession, you will never be hindered,
never meet with impediments; you will not lament, you will not
blame, you will not flatter any person.""_Discourses 1.1. I heard Peter Theil once say that if someone could innovate a pill that would safely eliminate the need  for sleep, he would move the world from zero to one. In a way though, this person would be considered a fool, the same way we think of Socrates, Diogenes, Epictetus as having moved the world from zero to one for championing a philosophy that has stood the test of time. And yet I feel these guys where probably considered fools on some level in their time, just as I believe they would be considered fools in my current society if they lived now as they lived then. ""..the truly original geniuses are rare compared with the enormous number of talented practioners; the former acting as spearheads, opening up new territories which the later will then diligently cultivate. There are periods of crisis, ""creative-anarchy"", leading to breakthroughs to new frontiers, followed by decades, or centuries of orthodoxy, consolidation, stagnation and decadence-- until a new crises arises, a holy discontent which starts the cycle again....""_The Act of Creation.

Today I dealt with a toxic person in a stoic way,"Long story short 2023 was a really bad year for me, I was learning about stoicism but got away from the path at some point and let my negative emotions and anxiety dominate me 

I was super anxious about a college exam and so asked my friend if I could go to his house and say that I was worried, after that I got a bunch of messages from his jealous and egocentric girlfriend (who I used to call my friend) calling me a bitch that I was trying to have sex with him and saying that I was ugly and etc 

I tried to explain that I just wanted someone to talk with and even said that I was aroace but she ignored it

After that I noticed that I need stoicism back to my life and read meditations and took the idea of the 2.1 text “ I shall meet with the busybody, the ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial. All these things happen to them by reason of their ignorance of what is good and evil. But I who have seen the nature of the good that it is beautiful, and of the bad that it is ugly, and the nature of him who does wrong, that it is akin to me, not [only] of the same blood or seed, but that it participates in [the same] intelligence and [the same] portion of the divinity, I can neither be injured by any of them”

I noticed it was much easier to stick to my diet when I was living with my grandpa as there was no food or people to tempt me to eat.

How do I control my frustration towards others?,"Recently I’ve felt like I’ve been getting angry or frustrated over the smallest things, including statements from my parents. I’ve tried to calm my emotions, meditation and other techniques but I end up either yelling or getting unnecessarily angry at them due to miscommunication and not being on the same page. 

A recent example of this is my mum nagging me on getting a job (it has been a year since I’ve been unemployed) however during the start of the year she stopped me from getting/applying to new jobs due to my studies and exams. Now in these couple of weeks she’s  been complaining why I wasn’t working throughout the year, saying that, after being unemployed I “gave up” and was “too lazy”to find a job to her friends on the phone. In addition, she also complains/yells that the reason of no jobs accepting me was due to my appearance?!?! That it was because of my moustache and bleached blonde tips (note I am Asian, and she dislikes how I do not look like the stereotypical southeast Asian). Moreover, she sometimes doesn’t realise I’m trying my best, yes I agree I can be lazy and impractical, but they always disregard on what I Do and focus on what I Don’t (not sure if that made sense haha)Like I’ve been really trying my hardest to find a job. This lead me to lashing out and having an argument about it, and yet in the end nothing was understood between us on what we were trying to state, and she ended up pushing it off and blaming herself, that “it’s all her fault”. The same scenario has occurred with just different topics and statements ending in her blaming herself for being a bad mum.

This always made me feel bad, every time I’ve had an argument with my family members I always reflect on what I said and what I should’ve done instead of what I did with my actions, hoping that next time I’m met with this situation I can stop it from getting any worse. 

And I always remember that it is also their first times at living life and that they are also trying to figure their own lives out. With this I really do love my mum and I know she wants the best for me, I never want to see her sad or feel like a failure, she has gone through a lot of struggles and done so much for me, but sometimes our misunderstanding and miscommunication gets under my skin which leads to my outbursts of frustration towards them. 

But I hope that next time I’m able to calm myself in these scenarios so that we are able to communicate better, to be in the same page.

Any tips, techniques, books can help me out would be appreciated!!!

how can I stop worrying about these things that are out of my control," Title. I am an 18 year old guy, and for the past week, I have been experiencing fatigue, nausea, dizziness, and derealization. I was in a very bad rabbit hole a couple days ago, that I still am some-what still in, but have gotten ALOT better.

I kept googling, searching on reddit, trying to figure out what was wrong with me, and so I started to think I had: long covid (since i got it in july) , CFS, diabetes, kidney disease, bppv, dysautonomia, candida overgrowth (which ive now found out is fake), sibo induced symptoms (since i have gi issues for over a year now) , gastritis induced symptoms, you name it and i probably thought I had it.

I've found out alot about myself while going through this whole rabbit hole, and I've realized that im not really scared of ""death"" per say, I am more scared of not living my life because of a chronic illness not allowing me to live my life, and there for because I keep worrying about that, I don't really live my life.

My anxiety has gotten so bad, that now I can't really go to the gym without thinking I am having a heart attack or I keep focusing on the littlest things when working out. Like how much I yawn during my workouts. While I do think most of my symptoms are from my anxiety, I just can not help but think in the back of my head that there is some chronic condition that I have, that is also causing these symptoms. I just don't know what to do. I am trying to look for a therapist, and potentially get an evaluation done to see if maybe I'll need anti-anxiety meds?

There are also many research studies that prove that attractive people are perceived as more likable, receive higher salaries, and get far lower prison sentences.

Are we always in control of our thoughts and reactions?,"I'm completely new to Stoicism and currently reading ""The Little Book of Stoicism"" as my introduction to the philosophy.

I've come to the point in the book where freedom of choice is being covered in depth, specifically the idea that we're unable to control external factors in our lives however we always have control over how we perceive and react to these things, the section also mentions that only we have the power to ruin our lives.

I'm struggling with these concepts a bit.

I believe we can control how we react and behave to an extent but only within our given biological parameters paired with the environmental stressor. I think certain situations are harder for some, easier for others.

E.g. 

- There are people who have behavioural difficulties that descrease impulse control
- There are others with severe mental health issues which can cause executive dysfunction
- Addicts exist whose brains will crave a substance as though they would die without it (they may also suffer with one of the other bullet points to boot)

While a ""good"" choice can still be made, the ability is reduced when compared to neurotypicals with good mental health.

Despite the above, I've still found the ""You can always control how you react"" approach really helpful. My worst life decsions have been made when emotions are running high, there have been had countless past worries that I've tortured myself with causing unnecessary suffering.

I've tried to adopt a more mindful approach when my emotions are high and I've seen good results... however there's a limit. If lost everyone I cared about tomorrow, I would be unable to remain calm in the same way Viktor Frankl did or see this as something indifferent to my eudaimonian. (Things we cannot control being seen as ""perferred indifferents"" at best.) My happiness is partly tied in with those I love and I'm not sure I'd want that to change because it would feel like cutting myself off emotionally. I get that it's unhealthy to entirely rely on those around us for happiness, but for me to care is to be emotionally invested. I believe that to love is to accept the possibility of emotional pain.

Overcoming a major life mistake,"Would appreciate some guidance on how might a stoic best navigate a major life mistake?

I feel humiliated and defeated.  I know the past cannot be changed.  So all I can do is calmly set about dealing with the consequences in the present.

My mind, traditionally very determined and focused, is lacking the discipline to stay away from the humiliation mindset, the negative self talk, and the desire to keep going back to the past to fix things.  I allowed the initial situation to jar me so deeply that I fell in a vicious cycle.  That cycle drained everything out of me.  I speculate that’s why my previously strong mind seems almost unruly now.

How does one regain one’s head after losing it?  I don’t know if perhaps any of you has had any personal experience with this.

Thanks very much.",Stoicism,1703855528.0,t3_18tmu04,0.87,19

Stoicism in the face of injustice,"I'm wondering, as I haven't been through all the literature yet, how do stoic deal with severe types of injustice.

For example: A mother fought very hard to safeguard her child from an abusive husband.
The child is safe now.
However, disease and misfortune strikes the mother and after a long struggle, she dies, leaving her child vulnerable again.
All the while, the abusive father runs rampant, never being held accountable for his deeds, experiencing the bare minimum of bad luck.
Worst case scenario, custody gets transfered to the father.

In a more severe case, this is the story of a sibling; or your mother.

How do stoics interpret these events; how do you deal with the sense of injustice in such situations?

Looking for Good Translations of Seneca,"Hi! I have noticed some translations of original works are better than others.

Moving from fear of death to acceptance of it,"I’m looking for some stoic perspective on thoughts of death and negative visualization.

Recently, a few months ago, I had a surgery and ever since then my little mind is obsessed with the thought of the implant causing my death eventually. Thus, I notice I fear exercise, stopped hobbies, seeing friends, have no motivation for life. Some would call this a depressive episode, and suicidal thoughts were there for a few weeks but I overcame them after some time in therapy. As residue I feel like the fear is a  constant.

While I know that these are just thoughts, they seem to subconsciously define my living now. I keep analyzing my symptoms, the physical pain sensations, and mind feeds me images of me dying. And instead of accepting them, I fear them and am obsessed with them. I find it impossible to focus on anything else. Prior the surgery I found negative visualization a very powerful technique for relief and gratitude but now it only feeds the fears and suffering. Weird.

I have read a bunch of posts here on health, aging, and death, but I felt like reaching out nevertheless. Does someone wiser here have any perspective to offer me on this situation?",Stoicism,1703846640.0,t3_18tkdef,0.77,9
"Recently started studying stoicism, what direction to go for better emotional control over things I cannot change?","A little background, most of my life I’ve been extremely stoic without even knowing what it was. Until I was 26, I would even say it was bordering on pathological and uncaring. I went in the military after high school and had never found anything emotionally difficult in my life, be that deaths of family or friends or anything else. I felt nothing, no honor, pride, or anything, even regarding my time in the military. Everyone would tell me how weird that is to not be proud and I never really understood that until now. 

At 26, my life took an extremely sudden turn. Following the break up with the only woman I had ever loved, suddenly, and if by magical intervention, I began experiencing emotion on a level I failed to control or understand. The first six months were absolutely horrible but since then I’ve been able to for the most part control it. But it has been an incredibly weird and interesting learning curve. Even though I broke up with her a year and a half ago, I am still vastly more emotional than I have been at any point in my life prior. Everything from movies to friendships to failure with women, etc., has caused some kind of emotional response whether it is something I can control or not. 

The last six months I’ve been back in the gym, picked up boxing, and studying/reading about a lot of topics. Just generally continuing my self improvement. Once again I have found myself upset at something I can no longer control. I finally set up a date to ask a woman out who I have known for over a year, just for that very same day to be the day she told me she is finally in a relationship again. There’s nothing I can do now, I missed my chance and anything other than supporting her would be wrong. 

This has prompted me to look into and begin studying stoicism. I dusted off a book a friend gave me several months ago called How to Be a Stoic: Using Ancient Philosophy to Live a Modern Life. I have been reading and taking notes. So far I have been extremely pleased with this ideology. I honestly think this is my solution and my framework for learning how to channel my old stoic behavior towards things of which I have no control while maintaining this newfound emotion for things in my control.

I’d greatly appreciate any help pointing me in the right direction regarding authors, books to read next, or any stoic philosophers that come to mind in my situation. I am very excited and hopeful that stoicism will help me reach what I am beginning to expect it can. Stoicism just seems like the perfect framework for balancing out my life. 

TLDR- For most of my life I was very stoic until a break up caused me to become quite emotional. After studying stoicism the little I have, I believe it can help me channel my stoic nature towards things changeable and my newfound emotion towards things I can change.",Stoicism,1703817065.0,t3_18tbvhg,0.85,17
Diversity of thought in Stoicsm,"I would love to hear everyone’s take on a few related questions:

1. Diversity in early Stoicism: Do you think there was greater diversity of thought among the early Stoic philosophers compared to modern interpretations? 

2. Influence of surviving texts: Considering we learn about Stoicism through the few texts that have survived, to what extent do you believe our understanding is shaped, or perhaps limited, by this? Even among these sources aren’t there differences and contradictions?

3. Embracing diversity of opinion today: Given the potential variations in early Stoic thought, could we be more open to diverse interpretations of Stoicism in our community?",Stoicism,1703855247.0,t3_18tmqxv,0.75,2
Dreading the dawn of a new year and beyond it,"Some of you might be thinking, aren't t people supposed to be happy and feeling fresh for a new year. Well not so much for me. I'm a teenager. I got to put up with harder subjects, difficult teachers, in a new environment because of changing classes and having to put up with my family's reprimands or strict ideals. I know this might all sound minor.

But to top it off, I've experienced possibly the most gruelling period of my life I had ever faced. You might want to read my posts back in around April-July this year. Assuming that you've read my posts, I have developed a trauma towards the whole experience. I do not want to degrade others with much worse traumatic experiences. I'm afraid that next year I will have another ""gruelling period of my life"". Now the one back in April-July left me traumatised, so it makes the fear much more scarier. I'm not traumatized by the event itself, but the process of overcoming it. I went through a lot of struggle just to cope and overcome. And it was so arduous to go through that now I am intensely afraid of experiencing that same pain and struggle of overcoming another occurrence. Sometimes when I come across scenarios where the atmosphere feels similar to one of the situations back then, I would actually start to become self-conscious and panic. I would physically feel my heart starting to feel uncomfortable. Again, from an external view, this might seem a bit minor but for me it was definitely damaging so bear with me.

A part of me knows going through it is necessary for growth and learning. Since it was exactly that period of April-July that forced me to find something to help cope with things, that being finding Stoicism. Any similar hurdles in the future may also present the same kind of opportunities. 

But I can't help but worry and fear that similar things will occur in the next few years of my life. Just imagining having to go through so much of that same traumatic struggle. And this trauma causes the fear of suffering to overpower the fear of remaining static or the lack of growth. I also can't help but worry about the far future of my life as a whole and all the difficult things I need to deal with along the way. But I'll assume I won't live that long, and even telling myself this isn't enough (I am not suicidal by any means).

I'm aware that there are many stoic doctrines that can help with my situation or that this anxiety is just fleeting and should just live with it. But despite that I still can't help but worry. And I'm really starting to lose my ground to the present. It just keeps occupying my mind full of these scary images. And I don't have the time or privacy to randomly close my eyes and spend 5 or 10 minutes to mentally rehearse all my approaches(that's how I personally do it). Any advice from fellow stoic practitioners is much appreciated. It's also best if your response can be concentrated on all the aspects I've mentioned and thank you for understanding.🙏",Stoicism,1703836499.0,t3_18thtux,0.83,4

Is there any semblance of a Path offered in Stoicism?,"I was having a discussion with a friend of mine on the differences between Buddhism and Stoicism.

In many Buddhist traditions, there is a clear path to follow towards an enlightened state of mind. E.g., Lam Rim in Tibetan Buddhism. This path involves a defined set of practices to follow that are graduated according to different capabilities. Meditation is the core daily practice in the path.

By following a path, I mean following practices hat are different than simply acting as if one was in the end state already (acting in an enlightened way). For example, in Buddhism, there are practices of focusing on the breath or another meditation object; also practices of doing body scans of various parts of the body. This has little to do with enlightenment itself, but is more about training the mind in ways that are conducive for enlightenment.

In Stoicism, we hear of the most ideal ways to act in multiple life situations, but are there any paths or practices offered by the philosophers to work towards making those ideal ways to act come spontaneously (vs. just trying to act in a stoically correct way as much as possible from the beginning)?

Wanting other peoples lives,"I’ve been trying to study Stoicism and focus on my own life and improving it, not in a selfish way but just making my life better. One thing I can’t get rid of is the comparison to every body in my life. It makes it hard for me to focus on doing the right thing and putting effort into my life because I just want what others have. I want to live and experience stuff they do.

"Running away from ""change"" but how to stop that in 2024 ?","

I'm not sure what the right phrase is like comfort zone, change, responsibilities, take life serious, take actions. I feel like I've been avoiding working on my life for almost 2 years now and now that 2024 is about to come in few days. The feeling of regret and shame is boiling down internally. I'm reflecting so much right to a point Im feeling overwhelmed and emotionally mentally exhausted. I realize my mistake and I don't blame nobody but me. I knew I was suppose to not let failures stop me but for years I just accepted it and live in this passive life mindset. I didn't have the guts or courage to stand up and make a change. I'm already in mid-20s but barely have any work experience besides fast food and retail store aka people call dead end jobs. My age group people have already some finished college, working in desired field jobs, in a relationship, overcoming fears, living in the adulthood independent life instead of staying with parents. Meanwhile I ask myself like what am I doing and when is my time gonna come in life. For how long am I gonna sit home scrolling phone and avoiding life. Sooner or later life is gonna slap me yet I'm already feeling all this all but I'm just not understanding why am I not taking action. Am I trying to avoid failure, wanting to be a perfectinism, scared to take action, face life sighs idk. If I don't help myself than nobody will.

How can I adhere to my ideals when there are times when I just don't care?,"I have all the reason and knowledge I could possibly need to understand which habits I should be rid of, and which ones I should focus on. The issue is, in the same way one might get tired for no reason, I seem to always naturally have moments where I don't care whatsoever and am completely apathetic to my ideals. Any idea of being disciplined goes out the window when I don't care about the reasons I was being disciplined to begin with.

It is only very recently that I discovered stoicism and realize how closely it hit home. I also read about how that mentality can encapsulate and be practiced in all aspect of your life but I still struggle to apply it.

One of my life goals is to have a family. To have someone to love and who love me back. Not having it is a great source of grief for me even though it is not something in my control. But what can I control in this scenario?

Following my passion or following what my parents think is best for me.,"I (M,23, working class) hardly go out, I study at college (it's free here) and live in a developing country. I have friendships that are not really friendships since I hardly interact with them and I don’t have much in common, in reality I just have two true friends which I see seldom. My mother (F,41) says that I need to get out of my shell, wake up, go out more and I just realized that what I really like is art, which is a great coincidence; however, I am very clear that I want to dedicate myself to art and design, after drawing since childhood and coming up with stories, ideas and new narratives since childhood also and being part of an NGO and doing great things for the Marketing Department. I also decided I could look for groups with interests similar to mine. My mother, however, tells me that I have to look for other environments besides the one I want, to see how the real world is, and that I have to open up to other environments and that she can accommodate me in a job with my father where I can learn how to relate to other people, but that is not what I want at all, because I feel that I would be betraying myself and my ideals if I take that job. She is also looking for opportunities for me within her job, and says that I have to open up or else, I will be lost for many years like my father (M,41), who has been in the limbo of jobs he didn't like until he found a stable job (although, my father always wanted to be a full-time musician but wanted to find other jobs out of necessity cause he had a child, me, even though there were lots of opportunities as a musician). I have also worked for a Google Partner agency for some months but they fired me cause I couldn't meet the KPIs, and honestly, I didn't like that job and also had school and my volunteering at the NGO. That is my problem, choosing between dedicating myself to what I like fully or doing other things and leaving art and design as a hobby. As additional information, I have gone through diagnosed Generalized Anxiety which was crippling at the beginning but that over time it has lost power, and really in social environments I have trouble staying focused and I tend to be extroverted in some situations but according to my mother I do things that are not relevant or that are not socially acceptable (basically I lack social skills and everyone can step on me, as she says), such as asking an Uber driver politely if he can change the music being someone I just met today, or asking them (my parents) what they are talking about when I get to the table with them, that according to her. She also told me that I have to adapt to this society that is very superficial, in this developing Latin American country, since she lived it that way. Basically image sells way better than intelligence and competence, and she is saying about my attire and that I need to dress better, to which I agree. What can I do about it? What would be your advice? I understand that she wants the best for me and cares for me considering the situation in which we live in, but I just took a path I realized I didn't want once with my first degree, and lived in fear and pending for other people's approval for way too long (to which my mother disapproves because she says that if that was the case, I would be working on myself already). Is there any Stoic literature that talks about finding pursuing one's passion or what would be tbe best Stoic advice in here?",Stoicism,1703787595.0,t3_18t0mlo,0.77,5

About things you cannot control,"I am new to this. What i understand is stoicism focuses on things you have control on, how to control things you can control. By default, humans are bad about distinguishing what they are in control of, and what they are not, and they are bad about actually controlling things they can control.

However, does stoicism promise to completely let go of things you cannot control, no matter how grim, exhausting and horrible they are? In the sub i noticed a frequent answer of ""Do you have control on it? If not, just go and focus on things you have control on"".

 To me its not realistic, to just not care and not be bothered by things you dont have control on. Similiar to be a buddist monk, to let go of earthly desires etc. Those who actually achieve that are born in temple culture and has no metropolian city problems in the first place. 

Maybe you can be bothered less, maybe you realize they are not that important to be bothered so much and let go, but can a hypotetical person John, who is cancer, is 4'5'' height adult male and in a third world country with a very toxic family, with no way out of his house, achieve to be not bothered by all this?

Thinking less extreme, i see its completely normal to be bothered by being unattractive for example. It is objectively hurting your social status especially dating. Maybe you are not absolutely doomed, but to simply say ""just focus on things you have control on"" sounds a shitty advice to be honest. ",Stoicism,1703760742.0,t3_18sr89r,0.67,4
I have a habit of engaging in digital self-harm.,"I am brand new to Stoic thought.

I don't know why I'm drawn to this habit. I'm currently recovering from many years of Incel thought and behavior that did nothing but harm my mental health and confidence. Even when I tell myself I shouldn't read that study or look at that thread I do it for some reason.

December’s Trials,"The month of December’s been a real test. In order of sequence.

* Mass Layoffs in my organization. I was forced to lay off 12 people on my team. About 70%.
* My cat of 12 years was diagnosed with lymphatic cancer. He died two weeks later in my arms when we euthanized him while he was starting to have congestive heart failure.
* We got a call my wife’s father was going to pass. Got on a 5 hour flight to a different country the next morning. He died 3 days later when we were in the room. Difficult scenario. Multiple religions. Multiple cultures. His burial wishes were odds with the family. I had to mediate between passionate people.
* Got a respiratory illness on the plane there, kicked into full gear by the time I flew back.
* Multiple hour plane delays.
* By Christmas Eve I got gastritis. Recovering now.

I had Stoicism by my side throughout. Quick reminders to calibrate me at the thousand moments throughout it all.

When my cat passed, I remember feeling grateful to have premeditated on this event for many years, never having lost an opportunity to enjoy him. Taking comfort in knowing I did my best to save him. And helped his passing when nothing else could. I’ll miss that little guy. But he’s been restored now.

When I was mediating a difficult family situation I anchored everything around what my proper role was in this family as a husband of a wife. A son-in-law. A guest.

When I got sick I recall being grateful for an opportunity to be reminded how nice it was to be absent of symptoms. There was one day I had a 7 hour migraine, pain piercing through all thoughts except a thought that I desired for things to be exactly as they were.

There were a thousand moments for Stoicism. A thousand reflections. It saved me from so many passions. But I won’t lie to you and pretend I was free from them.

When my cat passed, I was angry at the universe for about a day. In temporary disbelief, even though I witnessed his passing with my own eyes. I was inconsolable.

Now that I’m through it all. I have to admit I am exhausted. I would even go as far as saying I feel depressed. Like missing joi de vivre. Like the world lost some saturation in its colour. I cannot diagnose the cause for this, so I am giving it some time.

We go through these things because we have to. The only choice we have is in how we choose to take it on.

I recall Zeno’s story of the dog and the cart. I recall Marcus talking about what bearable pain is. I recall Epictetus and his many lessons about loss and one’s proper role. And envisioning how you’d like to maintain your character in adversity. I recall many of the people of this community, their insights and advice to others.

Looking for the source of a quote by Marcus Aurelius,"I'm looking for the source of a quote about criticism. I believe its from Marcus Aurelius but I can't find it. I googled and found a reference to it here:

[https://dailystoic.com/how-to-not-be-afraid-of-criticism/#:\~:text=As%20Marcus%20Aurelius%20writes%2C%20if,and%20already%20be%20fixing%20it](https://dailystoic.com/how-to-not-be-afraid-of-criticism/#:~:text=As%20Marcus%20Aurelius%20writes%2C%20if,and%20already%20be%20fixing%20it)

>""As Marcus Aurelius writes, if that criticism is correct and we are in error then the person criticizing us has done us a favor by correcting it. If they are wrong, what do we care? More likely, if we are doing our job right, we should already be well aware of the issue that people are raising and already be fixing it.""

EDIT: Please... this is about the correct source of the quote and not about Ryan Holiday. IMHO quotes without specifying the source of the quotes are almost worthless because then you can't check the context of the quote.

But so far I was unable to locate this in the Meditations. I did find Meditations 5.3 which is similar but not the same:

>\[3\] Judge yourself entitled to say or do anything that’s in accord with nature, and don’t let yourself be talked out of it by any criticism or argument that may follow as a consequence. If it was the right thing to do or say, don’t put yourself down. Other people have their own command centers and their own impulses, and you shouldn’t let your attention be caught by them, but carry straight on,6 following your own nature and universal nature, two things that share a single path.

Epictetus Encheiridion 42 is similar:

>42. When someone acts badly towards you, or speaks badly of you, remember that he is acting or speaking in that way because he regards that as being the proper thing for him to do. Now, it isn’t possible for him to act in accordance with what seems right to you, but only with what seems right to him. So if he judges wrongly, he is the one who suffers the harm, since he is the one who has been deceived. For if anyone should think a true composite judgement\* to be false, the judgement itself isn’t harmed, but the person who has been deceived. If you start out, then, from this way of thinking, you’ll be gentle with someone who abuses you, for in each case you’ll say, ‘That is how it seemed to him.’

Can somebody please give me the source of the Marcus Aurelius quote (Meditations book/chapter) ? I don't want to use this like 'Somewhere in the internet I found that Ryan Holiday said that Marcus Aurelius said that,,,""

Thank you in advance.

Oh, BTW, if I'm incorrect and its not from Marcus Aurelius then I made a mistake and feel free to correct me, I will not be harmed :D",Stoicism,1703761895.0,t3_18srj8d,0.8,3
"Breaking the cycle, how?","Hey fellow stoics, I have some questions that I like to gain some insight in. Also, sorry for using a throwaway.

Some background about me. I have what I would consider a successful and fulfilled life. On the other hand I have always dealt with some mild level of anxiety, depression, perfectionism and self doubt. Not exactly to the point where I consider this clinically relevant but it's still annoying and probably the root cause of some of the issues I dealt with for years (if this is relevant I can go into details at a later point).
I have some formal (university level) training in philosophy and stumbled on stoicism a couple of years ago. I read Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and a couple of others.

So here is the issue: on a rational level all of stoicism makes perfect sense to me. I can subscribe to almost all if not all of the points, BUT... I feel like I struggle big time applying them to everyday life. How much varies by occasion but in general I blame this to my latent anxiety issues. I want to give two examples:

I have a rather annoying and difficult neighbour. This person is for some reasons, which I can partly empathize with (although I'm legally and morally in the right), angry at me and tries to make my life harder. To this date almost all of the stuff are minor incursions, making noise, minor insults, throwing rubbish over the fence in my garden now and then. Rationally I know perfectly well that I should ignore him, that I should just continue to live my life. This situation continues for half a year now and the agressions Come in waves. Whenever there is a new set I'm losing my composure and start spiraling into a fear hate anxiety thought spiral which wrecks my whole day. When I try to rationalise this there are still the physiological symptoms, heart beating, muscle tension etc. This immediately pulls me back.

Second example are certain interactions with my son. There are certain instances where his behaviour is triggering my rage and this is 100% out of that I love him and see that a certain behaviour in his future will probably hurt him and so I have to somehow deal with this. Whenever I throw a fit I immediately regret it because I realise how irrational this is. Also there mostly the physiological reactions suck me completely in and my rational brain shuts off.

Those are but two examples where I have a huge cognitive dissonance between how I know I should act correctly and how I actually react.

How to best practice stoic values?,"In particular I’m having trouble letting go of that which I cannot control.

I had what I deemed the perfect life about a year ago.  I’d worked decades for it.  A turn of futures changed that early this year.

I’ve been doing therapy and reading a ton to try to overcome the trauma the change caused.  Yet it remains quite challenging for me to simply practice radical acceptance and be “happy” again with significantly less.

To elaborate, a year ago I was about to marry the love of my life with whom I was looking forward to starting a family shortly thereafter.  I’m 36 now.  We broke up in January over a personal tragedy of mine.  Now not only do I still have that personal tragedy to live with the rest of my life; I lost the woman I wanted to build a life with.  The personal tragedy left me with fewer prospects at a time in my life when I had already started feeling the pressure to start a family.

Struggling to radically accept my tragedy and my diminished prospects.  Even if rationally I can see that I have no control over the past and only reaction to it, I still struggle to no get down a year into it.

Struggling to balance the teachings of stoicism with other conflicting philosophies,"I (19M) recently got into stoicism this last summer, as the teachings of self control and freeing oneself of anxiety deeply resonated with me. Marcus’ Meditations was actually the first book I’ve completed out of my own interest, rather than being forced to read by a school curriculum. I began to implement many of the stoic teachings into my life and found mostly positive results.

However, recently I’ve started to get into conflicting philosophies, such as Machiavellianism and I have picked up books like Robert Greene’s 48 Laws of Power to supplement this interest. Through reading works like the 48 Laws of power, I came to a realization that it is nearly impossible to balance these 2 differing ideologies at once. Both these ways of thinking resonate with me in different ways, both being equally compelling.

Against Nature as Grounds for Compassion,"*  Musonius Rufus, like the other Stoics, advocated love for our fellow man. So then, what justification does Rufus give for compassion? He argues that compassion is in accordance with human nature. He justifies this by pointing to what we can observe in both human beings and bees, with both species cooperating with their own.
* My problem with this is that all kinds of things we would consider evil, such as rape and murder, are also part of human nature. Does that mean we must do those things too?
* Rufus would, I believe based on certain passages, counter this by saying things like rape and murder are hated and punished in all societies, at least within the boundaries of said societies (native American tribes would have no qualms about hurting members of other groups).
* The problem would be that this is a justification based on social consensus. It would be essentially saying ""Society approves it, therefore it is right"". And yet, there are things that societies past and present have approved of that are obviously immoral. Child sacrifice, female genital mutilation and ritual animal torture are things that have been or still are practiced and approved of under social consensus, and the reader of this message would most likely reject them with vehemence.
* Therefore we must conclude that nature, whether it be the nature of individual humans or the nature of society, is no grounds for compassion. ",Stoicism,1703699673.0,t3_18s6mnh,0.67,1
Emotional Repression w/Misapplication of Stoicism,"
u/SimonDK1994 brought up a very good point to my previous post: 

1.	⁠Make **S**ure to acknowledge your feel**i** n **g**s. People trying to practice stoicis**m** tend to surpress feelings before they learn th**a**t they should actually acknowledge them more and THEN deal with them rationally. This can lead to pinned up emotions and at some point send their world crashing down.(Ask me how i know)

I have been reflecting on it a lot more, and realize that I’ve actually been repre**s**sing my emotions *a lot* more than I thought. So I did more studying, and I’ve concluded the following: 

If there is a situation that ruffles me up, such as the train being delayed, I feel inpatient and angry. Because I’m trying to practice Stoicism, I usually would remind myself “Be calm, there’s nothing to be angry about.” This never actually wor**k**ed as **i** would *pretend* that I’m calm and **b** el **i**eve I was succee**di**ng, but inside I was reaching my boiling point. The issue here is that emotions are dependent variables, so we cannot simply say “Don’t be angry, there’s nothing to be angry about” as the anger has already been produced. If I want to not be angry, the anger has to genuinely not come in the first place. If it does, that is when we should reason to attempt calm ourselves down, not to pretend that we can just will our emotions away. Wait, is that what Epictetus meant when he said, 

“*For this reason also it is ridiculous to say, “Suggest something to me.” What should I suggest to you? “Well, form my mind so as to accommodate itself to any event.” Why that is just the same as if a man who is ignorant of letters should say, “Tell me what to write when any name is proposed to me.” For if I should tell him how to write Dion, and then another should come and propose to him not the name of Dion but that of Theon, what will be done? What will he write? But if you have practiced writing, you are also prepared to write anything that is required. If you are not, what can I now suggest? For if circumstances require something else, what will you say, or what will you do? Remember then this general precept and you will need no suggestion. But if you gape after externals, you must of necessity ramble up and down in obedience to the will of your master. And who is the master? He who has the power over the things which you seek to gain or try to avoid.*” - Discourse 2.2 “Of Tranquility from Pertubation”

If we injured our leg, it has already been injured, so just telling yourself to calm down is like telling someone to “just walk” on their injured leg.

So then we need to focus on the independent variable(s). Would that be our impressions? ",Stoicism,1703661595.0,t3_18rutqx,0.99,8

How would you proceed in my situation from a stoic point of view? Advice for dealing with a flaky friend,"A friend I considered close has disappointed me and out of curiosity I would like to hear how others may choose to act in this situation (from a stoic point of view).

A month ago I had a low point and messaged my friend if she could call me whenever she was free. No response.

A month passes and she completely ignores the message. I know she'd been out partying etc. At the very least she could've messaged me just to let me know she's a little busy and will catch up when she's available etc. out of respect. 

Additionally, I usually spend Christmas with her family because I'm in a foreign country and I've gotten close with them; they are always so caring and kind to me. Before this silent month, she had mentioned the invite from her parents again. But since ignoring my message she also never followed up on that invite or bothered checking on my Christmas plans etc. I also did not feel comfortable reaching out to inquire about coming over for Christmas since she hasn't even had the courtesy to open my message. 

Finally I receive a lame message from her on the 23rd about how she apparently didn't notice my message and that she's been busy working and fell ill on the week etc. 

I love her but I know she has tendencies to be...entitled and kind of unreliable. Not only with me but that's her core personality. She does what feels best to herself in the moment dealing with the consequences later. There's also been one other ongoing issue (nothing too serious but still enough for me to get annoyed and insecure) that I've tried to communicate to her but her behavior has not changed and I'm not sure I'm comfortable tolerating it anymore. 

I haven't bothered to respond to her message yet. I considered just ghosting her myself snd not talking to her again. Is that a bit too strong a reaction?",Stoicism,1703551315.0,t3_18qvdts,0.61,2

Acceptance being key to every problem!!,"As title says, i oftentimes think that the world around me is far prettier and interesting place, quite contrary to what i have felt and what kind of images i made in my mind. In my case, most of the obstacles in my life are created by none other than me. So it's obvious that i wasn't able to find a subject to direct my frustration to. After a long series of repentance and self-growth and a huge amount of increase in self-esteem, i have come to this conclusion that the problem in my life is me only, by improving myself over time, and accepting my situation more rather than running away from it or ignoring it, just worked. It's not like all my issues has faded away, but at some extent, i feel pretty good.
Being a loner and immense craving of wanting to talk to someone and share feelings with, it was a lot of toll on me. So i just want to stop expecting any external assistance (A bare minimun socialising is necessary too).

"""The beginning of philosophy ... is an awareness of one’s own weakness and incapacity when it comes to the most important things."" -- Epictetus","Kind of going back to basics on this one (from Discourses 2.11).  Came across this as I was reflecting on my struggles with letting go of past mistakes. 

Had a realization that it boiled down to my own arrogance as I looked back on my life.  I was holding my younger self to an unrealistic standard of perfection, that I *should* have thought and acted a certain way (given what I know now).  

Once I started accepting my own flawed nature as a typical human being, I could look back upon my earlier failures with more compassion and forgiveness.  With this came welcome sense of peace and relief.

As Ward Farnsworth puts it in The Practicing Stoic:

*Stoicism, as we have seen at many points, is a humble philosophy. It starts with candid assessment of one’s own flaws and foolishness. As the Stoic sees it, a confession of weakness is not weakness; it is the way to wisdom.*",Stoicism,1703453242.0,t3_18q4a2h,0.96,24

How would a stoic react to bullying?,"

Just graduated from high school, but the entirety of my last semester was spent being gaslit and bullied by one of the school’s favorite students. They promoted her as the most perfect person in the school so I felt like there was an ideal I could never measure up to as a boy, meanwhile she constantly mocked and belittled all of the boys in our class including me, but when I tried to tell the teachers about it she targeted me specifically.  She gaslit me into thinking I was some kind of monster she couldn’t feel safe around and I was scared to go into school most of the time. When I tried to talk to her about it, still thinking she was a good person, she got the teachers to shut me down entirely. Now I was not only being manipulated and bullied, but I couldn’t defend myself. Meanwhile the school, a Christian school btw, promoted her as the most perfect and Christ like student. She was one of their best athletes as well. The teachers refused to do anything about her and I ended up in some pretty disturbing patterns including potential suicide. I eventually came to find out that she was bullying everyone else too, but it was all completely permissible by the school. I don’t know what to make of my faith as a whole if that is what Christianity looks like. I’ve been in therapy for the past several months and I’ve been out of school entirely since may, but she is living in my head rent free and she will not leave.

"Question for veterans and seasoned stoics.

The basics are there, but I'd like to ask the veterans of this philosophy a few things. What part of Stoicism is ignored in its most commercial version? Is there any aspect of Stoicism that has been given more importance than it should? Is there any concept that has been distorted?

For example, I understand that Stoicism also dealt with metaphysical issues. This is not something that is mentioned frequently.

2) The Other Way: Speak up, try to change the situation if given, but if it doesn't, then accept it.

Applying principles in day to day life,"Hello, folks.

I have read about Stoicism for some time now, and am slowly but surely making my way through a number of books. My initial introduction was quite by accident when I encountered Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. This has also led me to read Letters from a Stoic - Seneca (I am not finished), and some of Epictetus (Discourse and selected writings. Translation,etc...by Robert Dobbin)

So much of this seems to make sense to me and I think there is real value in this philosophy. However, being so new to this, I am having difficulty in translating philosophy to concrete actions that I can take.  Amongst the most simplistic, but incredibly difficult for me to do is changing my mindset. For example, Epictetus states, “Man is disturbed not by things, but by the views he takes of them.”,and Marcus Aurelius states writes, ""Do not waste time on what you cannot control.”

What are concrete steps one can take in this direction? 

I have read the [Advice and Coping With Problems Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/wiki/advice/#wiki_advice_and_coping_with_problems), and again this makes sense when Epictetus wrote in Discourses that this takes time. (In answer to a man wanting a fig.) ""Let the tree blossom first, then put forth its fruit, and finally let the fruit ripen. Now although the fruit of even a fig-tree is not brought to perfection all at once and in a single hour, would you still seek to secure the fruit of a man's mind in so short a while and so easily?""

How does one even plant the seed of fig tree to begin with? 

* Are there concrete steps that one can take to plant the seed? 
* Once this seed is planted, are there concrete steps that one can take to build the mindset to manage how one views things?

Thank you for your advice and allowing me a moment of your valuable time!

A Stoic approach to dealing with a parent who has early-alzheimer's disease?,"I'm 19 years old and my mom has early-onset alzheimer's disease. She was diagnosed at only 50. It's not been easy at all.

I wouldn't say I'm new to stoicism, I've read Meditations, Discourses, and Letters from a Stoic. I've been interested and learning about it for a few years now, since before my mom's diagnosis. The issue is that learning about it and applying it are two very different beasts, which I'm sure you all know.

It's silly, but for some reason I feel like this is a true stoic ""test"" for me: facing an insurmountable tragedy I have no way of helping.

How do I navigate the future? I understand that this is something I have no power over; it is completely out of my control. But how do I actually *apply* that to myself? When I first started learning about stoicism, it was relatively straightforward to internalize because I wasn't facing something like this. But now that I am... I'm realizing just how difficult this philosophy really is to apply when tragedy strikes.

Senecas view on frequent travel,"Hi everyone! I just started reading ""Letters from a Stoic"" by Seneca. In Letter II of the book, Seneca states the following:  
""To be everywhere is to be nowhere. People who spend their whole life travelling abroad end up having plenty of places where they can find hospitality but not real friendships"".

I wanted to pose an argument to this statement. I am hoping to have others chime in with their own view / a response that may have been expected from a person like Seneca:  


Is it necessary to be somewhere? I argue that the brief and admittedly capricious interactions with other travellers and locals often exceeds the knowledge and wisdom that is to be gained at home. If I prioritised a friendship at home at the expense of gaining new cultural perspectives or wisdom from people I meet abroad, would I not be prioritising a passion over wisdom? Could the desire to form friendships not be interpreted as exactly that, a passion? Wisdom is a virtue part of the true good. Would it not by necessity be more valuable to seek out wisdom that is not otherwise to be gained at home, at the expense of lasting friendships? Sure, wisdom and new cultural experiences can be gained at home, but there is an air of complacency with lasting friendships that do not stimulate new perspectives the same way that frequent travel abroad does.   


I would love to hear your opinion and perspective! I would love to be made aware if I have misinterpreted something as well. Thanks!",Stoicism,1703387116.0,t3_18pm0fq,0.57,2
Finding meaning in life,"Stoicism has already helped me in becoming a better person. I can focus better on my studies, I go to the gym regularly now. When I have a hard time getting out of bed, I think about, what Marcus Aurelius said in Meditations:

>>At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: “I have to go to work — as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for — the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?”
So you were born to feel “nice”? Instead of doing things and experiencing them? Don’t you see the plants, the birds, the ants and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks, putting the world in order, as best they can? And you’re not willing to do your job as a human being? Why aren’t you running to do what your nature demands?
You don’t love yourself enough. Or you’d love your nature too, and what it demands of you.<<

But right now, I really struggle with finding any meaning in life. I feel depressed almost every evening because I'm thinking ""What am I doing all this for?"" The problem is that I've always found meaning in a partner. And now that I've been single for a while I'm finally wondering what else there is to live for.

For some quick background; I’ve grown up in poverty, suffered years as a child through sexual abuse, I’ve attempted suicide near the beginning of the year and have been admitted to the mental hospital 4 times this year, lost my job, evicted, cheated on (after 4.5 years) - ending my first relationship, lost all of my friends, kicked out of college etc. I am not attempting to elicit sympathy. I see suicide brought up quite often in the subreddit, so I am trying to offer my assistance. As of such, please correct me if I am misapplying and/or misinterpreting any of the ideas. 

**1. Virtue: COURAGE**
Life is feeling quite uncomfortable at the moment; Just as I believe it can’t get any worse, it just keeps throwing more and more surprises my way. Although I am working to *change* my outlook on life, my current belief is that life will not get better and I will just experience more suffering. I *suppose* that this isn’t true, but I genuinely do not believe its falsehood - **yet**. By practicing the virtue of courage I am accepting that fact and living *in spite* of that belief. As corny as it sounds: it takes courage to live. Courage is not living in the absence of fear, but to live *despite* those fears and discomforts. 

Another aspect of courage is *actually seeking professional help*, and having the courage to put my faith in these professionals’ hands. It was hard as I had ZERO faith that it would work, but lemme tell ya, **it’s working**. 

**2. Epictetus, Discourse 1.18 “That we ought not to be angry with the errors (faults) of others”**

 “*Learn that a thief and an adulterer have no place in the things which are yours, but in those which belong to others and which are not in your power. If you dismiss these things and consider them as nothing, with whom are you still angry? But so long as you value these things, be angry with yourself rather than with the thief and the adulterer.*” 

I use this concept to cope with 1: The infidelity and 2: The years of sexual abuse I’ve been through. Regarding the infidelity, their loyalty is exactly that: *their* loyalty, meaning it is theirs to give and theirs to take back whenever they please. Even if they agreed to give it to me, nothing hinders them from betraying that agreement. In this case, they have chosen to take it back, and therefore have communicated this to me through their actions. At that point, it’s up to me to decide how I respond to what they’ve communicated - we are no longer together. The decision to end it is not about hating or resenting them. If the only thing in my power is the right use of appearances, then I’ve concluded the following: It’s because I want loyalty. They’ve proven to be an unreliable source for that, and therefore it would be senseless to desire something from someone that they’ve *proven* to be unable to provide. 

**3. Epictetus as an example**
I mean come on, Epictetus has been through some awful ass shit. He is an amazing example of Stoicism at work. I have trouble following advice if the person giving the advice *only* knows the answers through theory as opposed to practical application. Epictetus completely blows that out of the water for me. If HE can do it, surely I can. 

**4. Epictetus, Discourse 1.24 “How we should struggle with circumstances”** in combination with **Discourse 1.5 “Against the Academics”**

“*It is circumstances (difficulties) which show what men are. Therefore when a difficulty falls upon you, remember that God, like a trainer of wrestlers, has matched you with a rough young man. “For what purpose?” You may say. Why, that you may become an Olympic conquerer; but it is not accomplished without sweat.*” 

“*But, you may say, there are some things disagreeable and troublesome in life. And are there none at Olympia? Are you not without comfortable means of bathing? Are you not wet when it rains? Have you not abundance of noise, clamour, and other disagreeable things? But I suppose that setting all these things off against the magnificence of the spectacle, you bear and endure. Well then and have you not received faculties by which you will be able to bear all that happens? Have you not received greatness of the soul? Have you not received manliness? Have you not received endurance? And why do I trouble myself about anything that can happen if I possess greatness of the soul? What shall distract my mind or disturb me, or appear painful? Shall I not use the power for the purposes for which I received it, and shall I grieve and lament over what happens?*” 

I have been given the faculties to deal with everything that has happened to me and everything that *can* happen to me. With that in mind, I have the knowledge that by using such faculties I am making them stronger and therefore becoming stronger myself. This, if anything, takes me RIGHT out of my suicidal episodes. Yes, the things that have happened may seem horrible, but I’ve *endured* them and grown from them. It’s like; yeah, that’s a big ass mountain, but I **climbed** that big ass mountain. THAT is what’s important. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHJHHH",Stoicism,1703303940.0,t3_18ox2tm,0.9,42

Mindfulness for War Refugees / Survivors,"Hey everyone, I'm a war survivor in my mid-twenties who've found refuge in a neighboring country. The war in my home country is still ongoing and it's getting worse by the minute. During these times I struggle to pull myself away from this very intense human experience. Can't help but think about everything I lost back home and the devastating news on the daily. I'm thankful for the safety of my family and the very fact that I have a job that allows me to provide for them despite the looming reality that I'll probably be a slave to it for the rest of my life and as a stranger. This is my very first time sharing all of this into existence, and I know that human suffering can be found everywhere around the globe. 

&#x200B;

Was wondering if anyone has been through a similar experience or have any advice/quotes or anything that helped them stay afloat during such dark times.

Does anyone else get massively dissapointed in themselves when they react based off emotion? How do you deal with that?,"Hi everyone,

How do you guys deal with reacting based off emotion?

 Lately I have been having kinda shitty days (I know this isnt an excuse) and I just sometimes do things that I very am dissapointed in.

For example just today when I was cycling back from the gym I see a family standing in the middle of the cycling lane like dumbasses. Now here's the bit im dissapointed in,  I gave the guy (I assume the dad) kinda like a death stare. Not a massive big deal I know but still.

What good does that do? Nothing. Will that prevent them from doing that again? Probably not. Will I get my ass beat if I do that to the wrong guy? Possibly. Maybe they didnt even know that they were on a cycling lane.  I immidietly after that was so dissapointed in myself. Like dude are you a baby?

I know that I am in control of my own actions/reactions. I cant control what others do or say. Some people are just not very thoughtful,(?) of others. Not everyone has the same norms and values. Maybe they were even new to the country and dont even know how the traffic rules work. I should pity them and not react in a hateful manner. But sometimes its just so grrrr, you know?

How do you guys ""catch"" yourself before reacting? I always have the stoic mindset after the fact.",Stoicism,1703270607.0,t3_18olvqw,0.95,67
Do we have to control the good in us?,"So I just woke up and started thinking about something I said yesterday. I told someone that in every human being there is good and bad and we have to accept the bad in us and learn to control it, so it doesn’t take control over us (as in overtaking us ig).

Now I’m thinking a stoic would probably tell me that we need to control our good too, as moderation is usually key. But then what’s left? Do we need some sort of balance because we can’t let go of our control of the good, because this will ultimately lead to back to the bad (e.g. maximizing joy in the moment, which leads to short term satisfaction but results in long term negative consequences (additional e.g. impulsive, reckless behavior)).

Does it all boil down to gaining as much control over ourselves as we can?

Questions about humanity and passions,"Hello there! Im new here since i just saw Stoicism in school, lol. Now, it was quite an interesting philosophy! I like it :D

But i have some questions:

Mrs Teacher told us that stoics must control their passions and use reason instead, so that way they act in a wise way. Passions arent necesarilly bad, some are good, others bad and other regular. But thats why they need to be kept under control.  If people get carried away by their passions, they dont act in a reasonable way and only cause more damage. I asked Mrs Teacher how much damage, she said ""Greed, war, hatred, etc.""

And i was like HOLY COW. 

1 - Passions really damage so much? The reason of why there is so much hatred, racism, war, greed and more, is because that most humans are passional beings and not rational beings?

2 - Also, how are we supposed to control our passions?

3 - If we somehow made that education promoted reasoning and all humanity became rational instead of passionae, how much better would the world be?

Thanks for reading. Merry christmas! :D",Stoicism,1703348104.0,t3_18p8z5k,0.43,0
I came in here yesterday for asking a simple question,"I came in here yesterday for asking a simple question and you all were so rude, isn´t stoicism about helping each other and not focusing on things you can not control?

My social skills are terrible,"Hello, M17 here. I'm not exactly sure how to begin explaining my situation but i'll give it my best. I've always been a very quiet person, but thing is i don't think i'm a so called ""introvert"". I want to talk to people, i like it, it makes me happy to socialize with friends but the problem is i cant. I don't know how to i guess. I'm scared to talk to strangers, though this has gotten better over the last couple of years after i've convinced myself that not everyone is negatively judging me 24/7, but my stubborness of talking to strangers is somewhat still there. And to get to the main issue, I don't know how to talk, even to people i know! I simply don't know what to say when i'm talking to somone, and so when for example i'm in a group of three, i'll just end up being next to the other two listening what they say and not contributing anything to the conversation. I try to think of something to say but nothing comes out and as i've said before, i simply don't know what to say.
I'm not sure why i'm like this, but my guess is how i grew up perhaps? When i was 4 y/o me and my mom moved to a completely new country. My mother did not know a word on the language. I don't remember much of when i started school, but i do remember i did not have friends, and this was probably in 1st grade. So really i've never had many friends either. Today i only have one truely good friend whom i am able to talk to. But as i've said, when someone else joins us, i am unable to speak, yet my friend has no problems...
I even joined my local volleyball team (because i like the sport) and I would say i'm somewhat friends with like two guys, but even then we don't hang out after practice except video games. I want to be able to join them talk after practice, but i just end up looking at them.
I'm just lost at what i should do, how can i learn to talk?

TL;DR I don't know how to speak, I want to talk but whenever i try, nothing comes out of my mouth and my mind is empty.",Stoicism,1703293175.0,t3_18otskl,0.81,12
I care too much about what others think of me.,"I (19F) have found myself to become increasingly overly concerned with how others perceive me and what their opinions of me are. I don't know how keep these concerns at bay. I am plagued by this fear of others disliking me or talking bad about me behind my back so much that I spend a considerable amount of time thinking about it. I am either thinking about what exactly about my personality is so off-putting or I am thinking about how I can manufacture a false personality to make myself more laid back and appealing.

A week ago, my best friend and his family, both of which I am very close to, invited me over for dinner and this wasn't the first time that this invitation was extended to me. My best friend's brother has a new girlfriend who showed up to this dinner and although me and her had barely exchanged any words beyond a hello, it was disclosed to me that this person does not like me for whatever reason. I am so confused and my mind does cartwheels trying to figure out what I did wrong when I do my best to be personable and kind to those around me. I know this is unhealthy and I shouldn't be so wrapped up in this but I can't help it. I don't know if I even like this person and there's a likely chance my friend's brother and his girlfriend will break up in due time yet I still care too much. Heck, I don't even know when's the next time I will be in the same room as this person.

This little incident is just one example of many where information was revealed to me about or I had found out by myself that a person who I thought I was cool with no longer approves of me and it's always something stupid and simple like people unfollowing me on social media, being quiet and shut down when I enter a room, ex-friends finding excuses to leave me out of plans and hang-outs, etc, etc. I understand to many, I have a strong personality, I have a bit of a potty mouth and my sense of humor is out there but never offensive and I don't let my jokes run wild around people I have just met who might not know better. These thoughts then extend to me feeling like the least favorite of every friend group or just overall an unimpressive and forgettable friend.

How do I let go of these thoughts and this pressure I put on myself to be as likable as possible to everyone I know? I always feel inadequate. I am new to stoicism and would like to put some stoic practices in my day-to-day but I am unsure of what the appropriate  response to all this is as I feel like me getting so wrapped up in my head isn't very ""stoic"".",Stoicism,1703298503.0,t3_18ovhbg,0.86,9

On being content with myself and wanting to improve as a person,"Hello!

Of course I know I have many vices. I can be very impulsive and feel like my emotions control me, although I know both have improved greatly since I have been exposed to stoicism. However, I struggle with my self image and loving myself knowing I have all those flaws.

Created a Self-Study Introductory Course on Stoicism,"I started reading “Daily Stoic” about a year ago, and really enjoy that is is mostly just quotes from original texts of the Stoic Philosophers. I do not really like Ryan Holiday or his anecdotes. Sometimes they are helpful for understanding the passage, but more often than not they seem pointless. So I wanted to read a mix here of modern stoic authors, while also reading some of the  primary texts. I used ChatGPT to come up with parts of this syllabus, but the texts and resources chosen are my own. Is this a good staring point?

Stoics Against Social Isolation,"I would like to discuss the stoic application of social interaction. This is in response to the frequent posts that go something like ""Due to x,y,z circumstances and events, I've decided that I'm never talking to anyone ever again, how can stoicism help me with the inevitable psychological consequences of my self-induced solitary confinement?""

I understand how someone could get an idea of the story of Seneca the Younger and him being wrongfully exiled, and I appreciate how well this story helps convey important tenants of stoicism, but I feel people run with the idea that stoicism = being alone. I also understand that Stoicism has been adopted by the ""sigma grindset"" side of social media that primarily values productivity and material success or status, which likely sends a lot of people here.

There is a concept of Oikiosis that's mostly discussed and referenced from the very early stoics like Cicero, but it's nonetheless important. My understanding of oikiosis is that it's the individual's natural instinct for self-preservation and care which extends outwards to friends and community, that helps develop an individual's moral compass. Moreover, the cardinal stoic virtue of justice does not only call for the fair treatment of others but also active contribution to the community, and this seems to be overlooked.

**In short,** if someone is dealing with a tragedy that has left them completely socially isolated, stoicism can help, but I believe, from my interpretation of the texts, that it's antithetical to stoicism to completely remove oneself from all communities. Thoughts?

**Some sources:**

""With the exception of wisdom, I'm inclined to believe that the immortal gods have given nothing better to humanity than friendship."" - Cicero

""No good thing is pleasant to possess, without friends to share it."" - Seneca

""Friendship produces between us a partnership in all our interests. There is no such thing as good or bad fortune for the individual; we live in common. And no one can live happily who has regard to himself alone and transforms everything into a question of his own utility; you must live for your neighbour, if you would live for yourself. "" - Seneca

""This is the first promise that philosophy holds out to us: fellow-feeling, humanity, sociability."" — Seneca

""Nature bore us related to one another … She instilled in us a mutual love and made us compatible … Let us hold everything in common; we stem from a common source. Our fellowship is very similar to an arch of stones, which would fall apart, if they did not reciprocally support each other"" - Seneca",Stoicism,1703274255.0,t3_18on6um,0.82,7
What are some good Stoic texts related to righteous indignation and not feeling anger and outrage when something doesn’t go my way?,"So I noticed I have this pattern where I get very angry when something doesn’t go my way. It feels like some great injustice has been done to me.

Rather than seeing it from a more objective perspective where it’s just a slight preference, that didn’t go my way, I get all bent out of shape and feel like it shouldn’t have gone that way, and things need to have gone differently, and I oftentimes get angry during these situations.

I’m looking for a way to change this behavior and be able to remain more levelheaded both in my behaviors outwardly, but also more importantly, in my inward feelings, as well.

I’m wondering if anyone has any stoic texts that they could recommend to me to help in this area?

Opinion required regarding action upon urges,"This post is somewhat inspired by a post I've seen earlier regarding sexual urges and masturbation and I've gained several thinking points from the comments there. Thus i want to ask your opinion on some issues I face.

Whenever I've acted upon my sexual urges ( be it masturbation or watching content regarding that) i feel like i have wasted the day and what ever productive thing i do or new ideas i think of on that day will result in failure down the line. Its like i have marked that day as a bad omen or something.

 I know it sounds childish but I  battle everyday with myself against obsessive intrusive thoughts,ocd and procrastination. So any pointers you can provide will only help me in that fight.

How to stop hating somebody and be stoic?,"Had an ugly falling out with a ""friend"" about nine months ago.  (He accused me of doing something I didn't do, and refused to accept my explanation.)

My hatred of him was infinite for awhile, and thankfully it's gotten at least a little better in recent weeks.  But plenty of hatred remains.

What's still holding me back from letting go completely?  I still have to see this person every week, because he works at a restaurant my husband & I frequent.  Obviously we aren't going to boycott the restaurant over this, but I do look forward to the day that he no longer works there.

Of the people I've actually known, my list of folks I absolutely loathe isn't very long:  An ex-boss, my brother, and the devil incarnate kid who came up from behind me when I was six years old and shoved my head into a tire rim just because.  Fortunately I no longer have to see any of them, so they (mostly) stay out of mind because they're far out of sight.

But I still have some rage when I encounter the jerk at the restaurant.  I wish nothing but bad things for him -- which isn't stoic, and I'm not proud of it.  I think my continued anger stems from the fact that at the time of kerfuffle, I could have really let him have it and told him off.  I didn't, and now it's too late.

Maybe the fact that I didn't tell him off was a form of stoicism?  I don't know.  But I'm really curious how some of you get so stoic that you can 100% tune out someone you despise, when that person is sometimes just a few feet away from you.

"Successful reframing of ""negative"" emotional reactions.","Ive recently had a light bulb moment regarding negative emotional reactions. 

A year ago I became aware of the childhood emotional neglect I faced growing up. I was completely burnt out and was unable to function at the caliber I had become accustomed to and expected from myself. This lead me to discovering CPTSD, followed by Stoicism. I'm sure the emotional neglect contributed to my negative emotional reactions, so this might seem more obvious to some.

Over the last year I would seem to grasp the Stoic philosophy, taking control over my negative emotional reactions but then a particular hardship would come along and trigger me, and make my understanding and practice of Stoicism become muddled and confusing. 

If someone was taking advantage of me or if someone was criticizing me unfairly I would become upset. I would try to work through this by telling myself ""don't worry about things that are out of my control"", ""how I respond is what's important, not what someone does"", ""judge myself on how I'm acting, don't project my morals onto others"", ""be kind to them, they are not intending to be mean, they're just ignorant"". Etc etc. Despite reading and reminding myself of Stoic philosophy, after each challenging situation I would still be upset inside. I was still feeling upset by the actions of others. I didn't know how to truly believe something that I didnt like, wasn't a negative. I also felt complacent, as if I wasn't standing up for myself in these situations. I couldn't make it all come together neatly and calmly in my mind and my gut. 

But then it hit me. How I'm viewing the hardship/unfavorable action is all wrong. I had been trying to deflect my negative reactions by looking inward for comfort, when I should have been looking inward to change my perspective. 

Below I've outlined 2 examples of my reframing and what response it yields. 

""Someone is taking advantage of me"" becomes ""someone is doing something I don't like"". Instead of having a negative emotional reaction to being taken advantage of, I now have the option to simply and matter of fact-ly communicate my needs and expectations or remove myself from the situation. Saying I am being taken advantage of is a judgement/assumption I am making of their behaviour/intention, and it makes me a victim. That's a tough pill to swallow. It comes from my own expectations of how others should act, it comes from my ego. Removing the judgement statement makes it much easier for me to respond rationally. 

""Someone is judging/criticizing me"" becomes ""i dont agree with someone's opinion of me"". Again, instead of viewing myself negatively through their eyes, which causes me to become defensive, I am simply saying we disagree on the topic, that their truth isn't THE truth. I can either express my views in a virtuous manner, agree to disagree, or consider their perspective and aim to improve if needed. My internal dialog switched from labeling myself as the problem, to labeling the problem as the problem. 

I would love hear more ""negative emotional reactions/judgements = neutral statement replacement"" that others can think of!",Stoicism,1703199062.0,t3_18nzowk,0.94,15

Understanding my own meditations,"I am fairy new to Stoicism I have been trying to write out conversations I have in my head in order to better understand myself and my emotions. I'm hoping with my recent studies of Stoicism, I am able to apply the values into my thoughts. I'd love to hear any feedback or to add some Stoic wisdom to better relate to yourself.

Why am I such an emotionally sensitive individual?

It feels like I don’t know how to take anything as a joke anymore. I used to brush everything off and laugh about it, but now I don’t know how to respond. 

No one is truly joking about anything they say. There is always some sense of truth behind their words. 

\- But people do joke, you have just been accustomed to bullying.

“I don’t see much you bring to the table other than constant sensitivity”

\- See? Bully.

Why cant a man be emotional without being ridiculed? Humans are designed to have emotion, it’s what allows you to express your soul. Men are told to remain unobstructed by any of life's mishaps. 

\- Correct. You must still allow yourself to process your own emotional reactivity to the thoughts following a specific event. 

Yes; however, we are still ridiculed for our emotions. The insecurities of others leaks out of them as they bark at  you for being able to be honest and open with yourself and your emotions. 

\- Then leave them as they were. Their thoughts and emotions don't pertain to you.  ",Stoicism,1703212842.0,t3_18o4hab,0.99,1

Eternal Return and Free Will.,"Hi!
I found the concept of Eternal Return which was practiced by Stoics, especially the earliest ones. I have got a question. 
So, according to the theory of eternal return, time is cyclical, it repeats itself and according to some posts I've seen here, it all happens over again, the same way it was before, so I understood that if there is a Glad_Communications posting this today, there was another Glad_Communications in the past cycle and there will be another one in the future cycles. And as far as my studies in Stoicism work, then nature is deterministic, which means that there are things which will inevitably happen, but we have some degree of free will according to the knowledge we have and will have, so... in that way, isn't then determinism and eternal return mutually exclusive? Because nature then would then be pre-deterministic.",Stoicism,1703177066.0,t3_18nraab,0.67,2

Loving Evil People," Reading The Meditations, Marcus Aurelius says that the height of all logic that all stoics should seek out is loving every last human being. I have been contemplating this for a few weeks but keep coming to a dead end... I have felt freed by loving those who are condescending or mean to me instead of stewing in my own damaged ego or pride. However, I don't understand how I can possibly love someone like Hitler or Leopold II or other people like them who are undoubtedly horrific monsters. I understand that people are a product of their environment, but at a certain point you are making a willing choice to continue down a path of moral corruption.

I just got fired,"My life couldn’t get any more unfortunate lol.

I missed a shift a few weeks ago because of a technical error that didn’t notify me that I was scheduled for that day. My supervisor notified me of this and I assured her it wouldn’t happen again but there was literally no way I could have prevented this.

Fast foward to a couple weeks later and I’m scheduled for a shift that conflicts with my unavailability (another technical issue). On the day before my shift starts (2 hours in advance) I let my supervisor know that I won’t be able to attend because of a competition. She responds 4 hours later and because of competition rules, I can’t use my phone and respond to her in a timely manner. I see her message a few hours later asking me to come in late but I see that it’s past the time of the shift. Here’s where I know I messed up- I eventually end up not followingup with her as I believe it would be better just to leave things as is since I thought the situation was under control.

I message her a few days after that regarding a question and everything seems cool, no mention of any issues regarding the whole situation or anything like that. Then, I receive an email on Monday saying that I’m being terminated for my low availability (this was the topic of the question i messaged to her) and that I’ve had two no-shows with little communication.

Dichotomy on Control as an argument about Identity,"Here is something I've been considering that I wanted to get the community's opinion on. I think that the dichotomy of control is better understood as an argument about **identity** (what we fundamentally are), than an argument about control, influence, or cause. 

The Handbook introduces the Dichotomy of control as follows: ""Some things are within our power, while others are not. Within our power are opinion, motivation, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever is of our own doing; not within our power are our body, our property, reputation, office, and, in a word, whatever is not of our own doing."" ( Handbook 1.1 Hard Translation).

Most people take this to mean that there are three things are play:

1. Us (who we are)
2. The things up to us (Opinion, motivation, desire)
3. The things not up to us (body, our property, reputation).

Instead, I think the argument is better thought of as this:   
1. There are the things that we ARE, that make up our identity (our opinions and desires).  
2. There are the things that we ARE NOT, that don't make up our identity (our body, our reputation).

Therefore, we should focus on improving and caring about what we fundamentally are. Our life goes better when WE are better (better opinions, better desires). Our life does not go worse when things WE ARE NOT get damaged (our office, our property). The DOC then is not about describing what we can or can't control, but about where the limits of our identity lie, which technically for Epictetus is our Prohairesis (our faculty of choice).

It is a change in the emphasis of the argument. Epictetus is not *just* saying that we suffer when we try to control what is outside our control (although that is true). He is emphasizing that we suffer when we identify ourselves with the things that are not up to us. When we think something belongs to us (is up to us) that doesn't.

This is why in Discourses 1.1 Epictetus focuses so much on personal identity. He presents an example with a tyrant: ""'Tell me your secrets.' I won't reveal them; for that lies within my power. 'Then I'll have you chained up.' What are you saying, man, chain *me* up? You can chain my leg, but not even Zeus can overcome my power of choice (prohairesis). 'I'll throw you into prison.' You mean my poor body.""

The humour in this passage is that the tyrant is trying to threaten Epictetus, but the tyrant is applying a non-Stoic perspective. He is threatening Epictetus' body, but Epictetus realizes that he is not his body and so he is not intimidated. He is his character, his prohairesis, his capacity to make choices. That is what applying the Dichotomy of control looks like in action, not just saying ""oh well, I can't control what you do."".

What do you think?

Stressed about money and future and status and happiness,"NOTE: I have ADHD and Crohn's, which I think influences why I feel this way. I'm posting here because I've found Stoicism helpful in the past and I think people here will have a unique perspective on this. 

&#x200B;

I naturally stay up late and wake up late. When I don't have external demands on me, I tend to sleep between 2am and 4am and wake up between 10am and 1pm. 

Obviously, when I was in school, I had to be there from 8-4 ish every day (well, excluding the large amount of days I skipped or left at lunch or showed up after lunch). I honestly can't remember how I did it. I think I was usually just groggy and annoyed for a few hours and then felt better as the day went on. 

After college, I tried to work various jobs that started in the morning, around 8 or 9. I quit all of them relatively quickly because I just hated getting up so early. I hated feeling rushed. I hated not having time to eat breakfast or have coffee or tea. I hated driving to work in rush hour traffic. 

After a couple years I went to Korea to teach in an afterschool English academy. My hours were 3pm-10pm ish. It was awesome. I'd get up, enjoy my morning, go for a hike or something, eat lunch, and head to class feeling good. My job was fun and I was good at it. Then I'd relax at night or walk around or whatever I wanted and just go to sleep when I felt tired. 

The problem is as I'm getting older I'm a bit stressed about money and the future and all that stuff. My job in Korea provided a free apartment, but the salary wasn't much. I could save a few hundred dollars a month if I tried. I came back to the US after 2 years with about 4 grand. 

I applied to a bunch of jobs in the US. The two interviews I got were car salesman (which sounded terrible and would have me working like 10 hours a day) and concessions at the movie theater (which I took and I'm enjoying, but obviously the money is very little). 

I've thought about ways I could make more money and I basically came up with 3 options. 

1) Do something online like writing or making videos or learning to code- This would be good because of flexibility, but it's hard to predict whether you will be successful. Also, I tend to get down if I don't socialize for awhile. I get energy from being around people and I don't know if I could be happy sitting in my room for 8 hours a day. 

2) Become a ""real"" teacher- This would require me to get a teaching license and/or masters degree. I could potentially end up working in international schools, which sounds cool. They also get paid a lot better than academy teachers. But from what I've heard, you generally have to spend 2 years teaching in the US or an undesirable country before you get a job somewhere I'd want to live. I really don't want to do that. And honestly, I don't want to go back to the school schedule, waking up at 6 or 7am. And I don't want to teach big classes, like 30-40 kids. The max at my old job was 12 and even that felt a bit much to me. 

3) Go to law school- I did well in debate, majored in philosophy, and got a good score on a practice LSAT. I think I have the skills to excel in this. But working as a lawyer requires a 9-5 type job (or worse if you want to make a lot of money). And also I think a lot of it will be boring and tedious and ethically grey, which I don't like. When I think about it, I did well in debate, but it also stressed me out a lot and I could get mad when judges were stupid or people were mean to me. 

&#x200B;

So, as you can see, I have no idea what to do next haha. I think two of the biggest things holding me back are not wanting to work a ""normal"" schedule or live in places I don't want to live in. To be honest, what I want to do is go back to working in an academy in Korea. I think I was the happiest I've ever been there and I miss it. But I'm scared of not making much money as I get older. 

I don't really care much about money myself. I really wish I didn't have to think about it. I kind of hate thinking about it. But it's important for security, in case of emergencies or what not. And I'm worried about my ability to date or get married as I get older if I don't start making more money. Most girls I dated in my 20's didn't seem to care, but will they if I'm in my 30s and still not making a lot? 

Anyone relate to this or have any advice?

Is this Stoicism?,"I read a book by the famous historical polymath ibn Hazm and something in my mind says its stoic.

He wrote:

""These words encapsulate all 
virtue: to control oneself against passion means in fact to turn 
away from one’s natural tendency towards anger and lust, 
things which are both under the dictates of passion. Then all 
that is left for the soul to use is the intellect which God has 
given it, the good sense which distinguishes it from the beasts, 
from insects or vermin and from tigers. “Never lose your 
temper,” as Allah’s Prophet (peace be upon him) said to a 120
man asking advice, and, as he also said commanding him, “Do 
as you would be done by” , together encapsulate the whole of 121
virtue


He further writes about the goal of all humans and all nations, 
“I have tried to find one goal which everyone would agree to be 
excellent and worthy of being striven after. I have found one 
only: to be free from anxiety. When I reflected upon it, I 
realized that not only do all agree in valuing it and desiring it, 
but I also perceived that, despite their many different passions 
and aspirations and preoccupations and desires, they never 
make the slightest gesture unless it is designed to drive anxiety 
far away. One man loses his way, another comes close to going 
wrong, finally another is successful - but he is a rare man, and 
success is rare, (O all-knowing Allah). Dispelling anxiety is a 
goal upon which all nations agree from the time when the 
Almighty created the world until the day when this world will 
pass away and be followed by the Day of Judgment - and their 
actions are directed to this goal alone. In the case of every 
other objective there will always be some people who do not 
desire it. For example, some people are not religious and do 
not take eternity into account. There are some who by nature 
and inclination prefer obscurity to fame [the obscurity of 
satisfied passion]. There are some who have no interest in 
amassing a fortune, preferring abstinence to ownership; this 
was the case with many of the Prophets. May peace be upon 
them all - and those who followed their example, ascetics and 
philosophers. There are some who by nature dislike sensual 
pleasures and scorn those who seek after them, such as those 
men we have just mentioned, and who prefer to lose a fortune 
rather than gain one. Some prefer ignorance to knowledge, in 
fact most of the people that you see in the street are like this. 
These are the objectives of people who have no other aim in 
life. Nobody in the whole world, from the time of its creation 
until its end, would deliberately choose anxiety, and would not 
desire to drive it far away. When I had arrived at this great 
piece of wisdom, when I had discovered this amazing secret, 
when Allah the Almighty had opened the eyes of my mind.


it should refrain from this passion, and the [Prophet’s] 
commandment to do as you would be done implies that the 
souls should turn away from the strong force of greed and lust 
and should uphold the authority or the means of justice which 
springs from the rationality which is part of the reasonable soul. 
I have seen the majority of people - except those who God the 
Almighty has protected, and they are few - throw themselves 
into the miseries, the worries and fatigues of this world, and 
pile up a mountain of sin which will mean that they enter 
hellfire in the Hereafter and will have no advantage from the 
perfidious intentions which they nurse so carefully, such as 
wishing for an inflation of prices which would bring disaster 
upon the children, the innocent, or wishing the worst trials 
upon those they hate. They know very well that these bad 
intentions will not necessarily bring about what they desire or 
guarantee its advent, and if they clarified and improved their 
intentions they would hasten the repose of their spirits. They 
would then have the time to devote themselves to their own 
business and would thus profit a great deal in addition to the 
return of their souls to God, and all this without having at all 
hastened or delayed the realization of their desires. Is there any 
worse deception than the attitude which we warn against here, 
and is there any greater happiness than the one which we are 
promoting?”122

How to avoid letting stoicism cause dismissiveness?,"“What can I do about my brothers anger?”

Nothing. You can do nothing about it. But you can control your response to his anger” I.e. don’t get angry just because he’s angry

This is true and it’s valuable to focus on not letting other people’s reactions cause you to react in a similar way

But at the same time, this feels pretty black and white. Maybe you can help your brother with his anger by asking what’s going on to cause it, maybe you did something that understandably contributed to his anger, and it’s unfair for you to say “hm his anger is his own problem, nothing I can do”. 

I guess what I’m asking is this: it seems that taking stoic lessons perfectly literally can cause some unfavorable interpersonal dynamics. Do you agree or disagree?",Stoicism,1703077627.0,t3_18mu6dh,0.87,11

I feel guilty and scared of my emotional responses,"Yesterday I had what started as a funny argument on a random topic. My sister and my husband had an opposite view as mine and both of them where interrupting me while I was trying to speak. I said “Shut the fuck up” which was meant in a jokingly way but my face showed my frustration of being repeatedly interrupted. They both said wow that’s not cool and I apologised on the spot. My sister got really triggered and threw in my face that I cry when someone tells me something that hurts my feelings but I say things like that when I am angry. Also I confess that lately I feel very emotional when I see my sister and my husband “coming together “ against me.

The point is that she has a point. I am a very sensitive person, I get emotional very easily and I just want to stop reacting. I feel like I always says something wrong and I feel terrible and insecure afterwards. I feel like I am a bad person for having these reactions. It looks like everyone can be cool and easy going but me, like I am always making mistakes and that the people I love will get tired of me.

Should I avoid confrontation? How can I be a better, wiser person? How do I deal with my insecurities?

I write this in this page because I am trying to learn stoicism. I spend most of my days alone at home and I feel happy and at peace. Then I am tested with actual people, and people are just hard form me. Any stoic material suggestions are appreciated.

Need help understanding,"Hello all, I'm 25(M) new to these pracitices. I would like to say right away I know reddit is not the best place to come to for advice. I feel lost, alone and not understood. Posting here as i don't really know what else to do other than seek anonymous help and what others opinions are. 

I have a really hard time either processing emotions or understanding them. I messed up yesterday and freaked out, all because I felt like an idiot because I kept pushing a place to go for vacation that people couldn't afford. Was not upset about that at all, more so because I was embarrassed and feel bad they didn't tell me and told my brother. It doesn't even make sense. I'm trying to figure out why I get like this. I'm starting to think I have emotional baggage that I haven't processed yet that causes me to act this way. My confidence is so low already and always feeling so unsure about myself might be a root cause?

I want to start learning and practicing stoicism so I can control my emotions. An old friend told me a couple months ago that I used to be so happy and care free.

What should a stoic define as true power?,"I'm in a career which gives me a lot of responsibility and authority but it tends to become fairly political. Due to this, mentors and advisors frequently recommend books like The Prince or the 48 Laws of Power. However, these books don't align with the values of a stoic and are ruthlessly pragmatic. I'm not sure how to incorporate the understanding I have gathered from these while maintaining my character.
The question I want to explore is how should I view power as a stoic, especially when the choices I make effect the lives of others. I literally hold people's lives in my hands due to my career, so do I owe it to them to be as ruthlessly pragmatic as possible?

How would stoics view modernity?,"
Modern day hook up culture plaguing the youth, wide spread availability of drugs, instant pleasure at our finger tips, no real commitments to anything, hyper active behavior everywhere, no real search for meaning, feminization of men, wide spread obesity, being a father or mother is seen as a ""waste"", lust and greed driven, etc...

I could go on with hundreds more but you clearly get the picture.

Before you say, ""that's a minority group and your spending to much time on social media...🤓"" I agree it is a minority, however, I lump it all together to create what I would consider a small majority group, or at least maybe that's where it's heading.

I dont really consume any social media and I'm not some old guy behind the times. I'm really young and I just like philosiphy.

So back to the question:

How would stoics, like Marcus Aurelius or Seneca, view our society today? Is it much different than theirs at the time? Also, what would they say to us in regards to how we should live, or what we can do to change?

Talk only when needed?,"After countless conversations I had with people, I am thinking about not getting involved in conversations.

Whenever I try to have a conversation, I try to be as close to reality as possible, instead of having my opinions or my conditioning. People most often take it offensive and project their hatred towards me.

Some people try to shut me off by saying I sound like a philosopher. Some people appreciate it though. 

It feels exhausting. I start to question why do I even have these conversations in the first place.

People often can't really accept reality. I don't know every truth ever. But I can perceive it to some extent.

To me a conversation is about exchange of information to learn and grow. There is some amount of egoic identity involved as well personally. I am not going to deny it. Still learning to not take it personally when I am defeated and trying to learn from it. 

I right now feel like I only need to talk when there is something gonna change if I contribute to the conversation. If things are not going to change, then why even take part in the conversation? 

If both the parties learn and grow, then it's fine. Or else observation and silence is better I guess.

Preparation for starvation," This may seem somewhat  pessimistic, but after deep consideration I realize this is a more likely issue I'm going to face in the future. Currently my families financial situation is mid at the moment. There's me, my mom and my grandfather. Truth be told we're solely dependent on my grandfather's pension. My mother is a housewife with only a high-school diploma. I passed my graduation and I have been trying for job for 6 years but to no hope whatsoever in the horizon. I did a lot of odd jobs and with recession in the country lost the current job I have. I'm have been trying for quite some time but it's to no avail. We have been rationing a lot of our food, but with grandfather's advance age and all and his medical bills, it seems it not enough. He's well psst 90 and he's have a lot of co morbidity. If he dies we can manage for a while but after a year or so we'll be dead broke. To prepare myself for that likely future I have been trying to prepare myself for stark starvation by eating a meal a day. Sometimes even no meals. I have been doing it for quite a few months now.

"Loved Meditations, STRUGGLING with Discourses","I read the Hayes translations of Meditations and loved it.  I then went to the Haward Morse audiobook of Discourses (Gregory Long translation.)  I'm STRUGGLING, with entire sentences, paragraphs passing by with little comprehension. The heavy English accent and old translation, combined with the fact that I consume these as audiobooks while doing long distance running, has me wondering if I'm wasting my time (7.5 more hours to go).

I'm trying to decide do I:

1. Quit, start over with a new translation and narrator, or
2. Suffer through it, or
3. Quit entirely and instead read a modern distillation of Stoicism (""The Daily Stoic"" or other)?

Observation from Beyond Good and Evil regarding criticism of Stoicism,"I am working my way through Beyond Good and Evil for the first time. In book two, Nietzsche goes on a tirade against a few different philosophies - including Stoicism. In it, he mocked the Stoics for wanting to live in accord with nature and basically said the Stoics imprint their own morality onto nature this way and that nature is ultimately indifferent. 

Then, later in book III he is talking about religious people and specifically about Christianity in Europe. In this section he says:

“Then, during the moral epoch of mankind, one sacrificed to one’s God one’s own strongest instincts, one’s “nature“: this festive joy lights up the cruel eyes of the aesthetic, the “anti-natural” enthusiast.”


Seems to me like this definition of nature that he claims is being sacrificed is rather close to the Stoic idea of acting within one’s own nature. To “live according to one’s nature” as I understand it (correct me if I am wrong) means, broadly for humans, living in according with what makes humans unique - their ability to reason. 


Does it seem like his argument about sacrificing one’s nature seems to go against the argument he made against stoicism? In my reading it seems like he miss-characterized what “nature” is in the stoic context and then, albeit loosely, admitted to the existence of “nature” in the form the stoics use by conceding some people do sacrifice their nature.

I could be reading too much into it, any thoughts from someone more versed in Nietzsche and Stoic thought?",Stoicism,1702945878.0,t3_18locod,0.85,5
Explaining Mortality and Death To Small Kids,"Curious to get some perspective. 

My five year old son will make a wish blowing out a birthday candle or something and I always tell him I hope all his wishes come true.  The other day he said, he has a wish that he know won't come true and then whispered ""I don't want to die"".  He then said he also doesn't want me or other family members to die.  

It's odd how over the past several years studying stoicism I've just fallen into the habit of contemplating my mortality and that of my loved ones on a near daily basis.  This might sound incredibly depressing to some, but it's really not.  Rather I see it as just being aware of how nature works and it also gives perspective into what I think is important to do with the present moment.  It's also amazing how this habit has cleared up some fears and self-doubt, but I digress.  

I've gotten into the habit of thinking before I speak.  I think it's a good habit, otherwise I might have said something like: ""you're right, we're all going to die eventually and that's just how things work but try to not let it bother you"" or some other thing that probably wouldn't really be beneficial for either of us.  Instead I just said ""it's important to focus on the time we have right now and enjoy the present moment of being here with each other"" and gave him a big hug.  

I feel like I somewhat avoided the question and have been thinking of other ways that I could respond, so appreciate any other perspectives.

"I need good advice from some stoic men, because i dont know what will happen to me now, im getting death threats in highschool","So around two weeks ago, my life was going well, my self esteem was rising from a shit 2022, and i thought i was out of the ringer. Then all that hope was thrashed into peices. bassically this kid that i was sort of friends with made this rumor about me saying that i leaked his home adress. This was a blow as i thought this kid was my friend. Then my popualarity and reputation that i once had crumbled. I thought this was the deepest pit of hell a man can face, all his friends who he realises are fake leaving him, although it got worse, so much more worse. Then he added  me to this group chat on snapchat and got this kid to threaten me and press me, no matter how much i tried to explain they would not understamd the truth. They forced me to confess to somthing i did not do under the threat of a beating. And i thought that that was it, it got worse, this was probably the first time i experienced real trauma, and im only a highschooler. They added me to another chat with 15 other kids, who were all gang affiliated although in highschool and they threatened me, harrased me and even said they would stab me. Those thoughts keep me up at night. Anyways i kept this all to myself, my pearents did not need added stress, and i was forced to pay these people 20$ to let me live. It got worse, the next weekend i had a family gathering, in wich took my mind of taht trauma, on monday i checked my snapchat, apparently over the weekend i was placed in another groupchat with even more kids, giving more death threats to me. the things they said made my shiver, i gave one $20 now they all wanted up to 50$ saying they wanted a new vape or a new knife. But when they did not get a response from me as i was busy with the gathering and hanging out with my cousins. They moved on to 3 other kids, pressing them, death threating them, they sent images of their guns and knives and vapes to them, and even took $50 from them. I could not let this slide, i had to make sure this would nto happen again, i got another phone and recorded the whole conversation,this way they would not know i collected this. That should atleast send them to juvie right? But i wanna tell the authorities in a way that would not let them know that i was the snitch, cos if they find out man then idk what will happen... anyways its been 3 weeks, school break has started,i deleted my snap account and blocked them all, i only have my family and becaus of erliar events no friends to spend the break with.

I am on my stoicism journey since one and a half year. I love the idea of controlling myself, my thoughts, my emotions & my actions. Sometimes I am driven by external circumstances, but I think that I am making a great progress in quickly realising what is under my control and what is not.

The reason:
Since 2 months I am experiencing a downfall of my relationship. I know my faults, I know what I did wrong, and I am taking a full responsibility of changing those things. Simply saing - my fault is that I was controlling. 

But everything seems that there is nothing left to save - my woman is extremely passive-agressive towards me, almost to the point that I question my own humanity. She makes me feel like a monster. Someone that is not worth fighting for.

I live in a constant state of alert, wondering when the day of saying goodbye comes. One day everything seems fine, and the second day she strikes me right in my heart. And yet, I don’t feel sad. I don’t know how to blame her for being shitty because I know her behaviour is not under my control. At the same time I can’t stop loving her, because I see those good days we have had.

She might be doing this to break me & make me pull the trigger first, so I will be a „bad” one in this relationship. The one that decided to left. Or she might be testing me if I am all into really changing my behaviour.

The question:
The thing that bothers me the most is that I used to be a very emotional man, but I can’t dive into my feelings anymore. I used to cry when I was upset or sad, but I can’t do it anymore. I just can’t. And I know everything would be much easier for me if I could. 

Can it be an early stage of depression? What the #%@! should I do? What the virtuous, spiritual man would do being in my place? I know some things, but I definitely don’t know what to do in that exact situation. God, please, give me strength & courage to do the right thing.",Stoicism,1702941541.0,t3_18lmq9q,0.74,2
How to deal with modern society and people,"I am currently living in western europe and in my opinion we are witnissing a massive decrease in the education and virtues of the youth / teenage people. The violence on the streets is also massively increasing and basically you are getting the feeling that almost every teenage person is just consuming tik toks and has the amibition to become an influencer instead of a ""normal"" working part of the society. I also think that every generation thinks of the next one as a downgrade but in my opinion the influence of social media, false role models and the fact that many children with (and also sometimes without) a migration background are not able to correctly write and speak the language of the country they are living in is scaring me a little bit about the upcoming future. How would a stoic try to accept and deal with these kind of things? ",Stoicism,1702913162.0,t3_18lbbne,0.75,10

Tochange thoughts or actions?,"In a recent post, u/home_iswherethedogis commented:

>The only solution to cognitive dissonance is to change your actions. Sure, you can change your beliefs (opinions) about cigarettes to ""oh, I'm young, I'll worry about my lungs later,"" but this will keep you stuck in smoking because you can't change a habit without changing the belief surrounding it. 

Id like to discuss this specific part further. For this given example, in the end clinically smoking is bad for humans. The resolutions given when boiled down were change thoughts or change actions.

In a different case: Maybe someone percieves that their work environment is rather hostile to them. When in reality, everyone thinks they're mediocre at worst. They could change their actions in the form of a job change, or change the way they perceive the work environment.

Point being, if one decides to change something, how do they decide on how to change? Maybe this dips a little too far into the ""Stoicism is not a replacement for therapy"", maybe I'm getting too far into the weeds of it and it really is as simple as ""it depends""

My father is an enigma..,"I [33M], like many, used to think as my father as stoic, however, he's gotten soft and depressed in his older age, especially now that he's retired. Not that he's accomplished a  great deal in his life, but he raised me right, taught me how to be a strong leader, and remain unbothered by external happenings.

I enjoy giving him this credit but I've also done a fair bit of development personally, professionally, emotionally, spiritually, and have had other mentors over the last 5-10 years. I've also became a father myself this year and am learning from that. I often wonder, am I giving him too much credit for the man I am today?

What's bothering me tonight is that my father did not show up to the family Christmas party. There is no bad blood in the family either and although we only get together a few times a year, it's something he always looks forward to. Every time.

So goddamnit, why would you no-show?

I suspect he may have something going on with his health and doesn't want to face his kids. I fear that it may be bad enough to where he can't do anything about it.

This enchiridion chapter.,"""If you intend to improve, throw away such thoughts as these: if I neglect my affairs, I shall not have the means of living: unless I chastise my slave, he will be bad. For it is better to die of hunger and so to be released from grief and fear than to live in abundance with perturbation; and it is better for your slave to be bad than for you to be unhappy.1 Begin then from little things. Is the oil spilled? Is a little wine stolen? Say on the occasion, at such price is sold freedom from perturbation; at such price is sold tranquillity, but nothing is got for nothing. And when you call your slave, consider that it is possible that he does not hear; and if he does hear, that he will do nothing which you wish. But matters are not so well with him, but altogether well with you, that it should be in his power for you to be not disturbed.""

Like, if virtue is the only true source of happiness then why is it so hard to act virtuously. Then I came across a possible explanation: The starting of becoming virtuous is extra hard, because of the vices you already have, the thoughts and opinions you already formed, and that's why the start is so painful.

How do I behave around people I have disappointed (including myself)?,"Few months ago, a girl I was dating suddenly broke up with me without much of closure (we had some communication problems and her being younger, she was in a different life stage). Unfortunately, going to the same band, which I was not willing to give up after 8 years of playing, I had to see her quite regularly. Even still, recently, I have finally started to move on. Then, three days ago, we were at the same party with our band and I got blackout drunk (although this kind of behaviour is not usual for me). 

Afterwards, I found out directly from her that I wanted to talk with her about us, although she did not, and that I behaved like a condescending jerk. She did not want to elaborate further, simply stating 'drunk men's words are sober man's thoughts', so I don't know my behaviour specificaly (and I really fear it could have been even worse). Of course I apologized and promised it won't happen again, giving myself a word I will further limit my occasional alcohol consumption. However, I have never thought I could behave like this and feel that I have deeply let myself down. Furthermore, I hate that seomeone will judge me based on my drunk actions and today, I have to see the whole band again and I am so ashamed of myself I don't even know how to behave.",Stoicism,1702896007.0,t3_18l5rnm,0.4,0

How to deal with expectations of recognition for doing the right thing?,"I've been interested in stoicism for a few years, and although I wouldn't say I'm an avid student of it, I do try to implement the stoic virtues and practices in my life.

By doing this, I find that often I choose the path of righteousness, of forgiveness, and seldom do I seek revenge or do evil.

My problem, however, is that I keep expecting recognition for doing such things. I feel like I deserve congratulations for making the rigth choices and doing the right acts. And I realize this corrupts my initial intentions as a whole. To the point where I can't tell when I'm doing good because I am virtuous and when I'm doing it to be percieved as good and mature.

To give you an example, I recently ended a friends with benefits kind of relationship, and this person is now dating my best friend. Note that I told my friend beforehand that if he was interested in her, I wouldn't be a problem and he could go for it. I had also told her during our arrangement that if she was interested in him, it would be okay, and she could just tell me and we'd end our relationship for the sake of theirs (because I didn't want a commitment with her, and they both wanted it).

She did not tell me she was interested, but she showed clear signs. She was quite disrespectful and hurtful to me a few times due to her inability to perceive and communicate her feelings. And I just did what was best for me and ended things between us.

And now, all I can fathom is that I made their relationship possible, and I feel like both her and my friend should thank me for it.

How do I get rid of this expectation? I've been reading Meditations but to no avail thus far.

A visualization/realization I've been having,"I thought I would share this in hopes sometime else has success with it.

I've studied Taoism in the past, and although I find it really similar to Stoicism, they go about things so differently.  Taoism seems to focus on truly accepting the things we can't change, while stoicism focuses on making the changes we with what we have.

With Taoism, I would do meditations where I imagined having an energy/chi inside me providing me with stability and warmth.  It's been very relaxing and calming to do this, especially while anxious.  So I decided to see how I could apply this to Stoicism.

When I think about what I can really change, it comes down to literally moving my hands, getting up, etc. way more than making money out something abstract as that.  So with that, I've been imagining the same ball of energy I used to keep on the inside, but just barely outside of me.  The gravity of it almost pulls me to motion and helps me see I am in control of myself completely and not ""stuck to the couch"" or whatever.

As a last note, these are purely meditations and figments of the imagination.  I see visualisation of my chi as similar to a *dogmata* or *mantra*, not something real or tangible.",Stoicism,1702876503.0,t3_18l0zkb,0.6,1

"A question about Risk, its worthiness and untimely death","Hello, 
I've been thinking of taking up some activities ( motorcycling, horse riding , a career that's risky in terms of mortality) that are sort of risky but am afraid of doing them for fear of injury or worse.

All my life I've erred on the side of caution, taking only calculated risks where the risks seems worthy enough, if the possibility of danger was even nominal I'd back off ( for example, i recently decided not to do river rafting). I am not lacking in courage but feel it best only to take risks that are ""worth it"".

Now I've been through some of the writings of George RR Martin and while its fiction in it a good number of characters -- good and bad die in the both unexpected and gruesome ways never fulfilling their destiny or their potential for great and noble things.

It also reminded me of Alexander The Great who wanted to conquer the world but died of Malaria, the second of the Mughal conquerers Humayan who died -- by falling from stairs in a library! 

The last great Hindu king who came from nothing but died from a single stray arrow hitting the only small single gap in his armor, Christopher reeves who fell from horseback and got paralyzed..any many other examples.

It makes me feel its better to stick to only necessary things. 

Why take these risks (motorcycling, horse riding) at all? I can make go through it for the career

This makes me afraid, what if i take any of these risks and get scared injured or die ...never even beginning to have fulfilled my duties or potential? 

P.S. I understand about the dichotomy of control and am not scared of death as a concept ( Death smiles at all men...all a man can do is smile back)..but the timing and worthiness of it",Stoicism,1702818583.0,t3_18kh0t8,0.81,6

"Not sure what the point of this post is, maybe just to get things off my mind."," 

Im a 20-year-old guy who recently wrapped up my gap year with a lot of hard work. Despite earning good money, I didn't save any. I spent it on a car and started but never finished my driving license. Now, the car sits unused, and another insurance payment is coming up.

Most of my earnings went into partying and, unfortunately, drugs. Thankfully, I've kicked that habit and don't feel the urge anymore—except when I drink, which is rare now. I've started university but missed three months of classes. I want to contact university about my situation but im scared they will kick me out for not doing any work at all. I like my course and the topics, but I can't bring myself to engage. I label myself as lazy, but when I attempt something, I can't seem to enjoy it.

While I hesitate to say I'm depressed, I feel lost. I enjoy life, people, even the ""bad"" ones, but I struggle to like myself or work on self-improvement. I have a wonderful girlfriend, and I know I'm smart, but when things start improving, I feel out of place, and they take a downturn again.

Two years ago, I lost my dad to alcohol, went through a breakup, and lost a friend, all in one year. Looking back, that seems to be when things started spiraling, and im not looking for an excuse, i cannot control that. 

I often compare myself to my successful sister, measuring my worth by materialistic standards, despite knowing it's not a healthy approach.

Today, my MacBook screen broke, adding to my stress as repairs will strain my already dead budget, but life continues with or with out. I'm not sure if this post even makes sense, but I felt the need to write and seek constructive criticism or just an understanding ear. It's strange—I know what I need to do, but I'm just not doing it. I'm trying, but it's all so confusing. This may sound like a cry for help, and I'm aware of that. I appreciate stoicism and the people here, and I just wanted to unload my thoughts.

If most of this doesnt make sense, dont worry, it doesnt in my head also.

Stoic View on Entertainment,"I recently watched All Quiet on the Western Front and enjoyed it.  I didn’t spend time analyzing my judgments about the movie while it’s happening as that would distract me from the plot. I just let my emotions run without questioning them. 

While watching movies I allow myself to get emotionally invested in the characters and the overall narrative for the duration of the film. A large part of the enjoyment I get out of reading fiction is from getting caught up in narrative, and viewing the world through the characters perspectives. These characters are usually flawed in some ways of course and are going to have errors in their reasoning.  Similarly, a large part of watching live sports is rooting for a team.

A little background: So I had a 5+ year relationship that ended late 2021. We ended up remaining best friends to this day. Since then, I wanted to get back with her, but have tabled it due to her wanted to work on herself and heal some personal trauma(due to school and family deaths). Throughout the process, I have really tried to be patient, but the past 6 months or so I have been losing my patience with the situation.

The real issue: I am fine with the whole “single” dynamic and letting her heal on her own. However, I do have personal sexual needs that are not being met (I have high sex drive). The last time we had sex was Jan 2022. We live together in seperate rooms but still kiss and maintain a closeness. I have tried to work with her and be patient and understanding but there have been so many times where something can happen and she pulls away. At this point, seeing how much I am hurting, she has told me to look elsewhere to get what I need. The problem with this is that I am devoted to her and am not looking for sex in that kind of way. I am at my breaking point. It not like I am addicted or am falling prey to my desires, as I have done without for past 2 years. But I also want to experience fun and life. 

Stoicism has definitely helped me maintain the past year. But the lack of any progress coupled with my inability to move on is shaking me. Reading Seneca and how he talks about time makes this situation feel all the more urgent to me…

Would love some good advice. Thanks for reading✌️",Stoicism,1702806429.0,t3_18kdxph,0.5,0
Help me with this phrase from Meditations,"If you remove your judgements of anything that seems painful, you yourself stand quite immune to pain. 'What self?' Reason. 'But I am not just Reason.' Granted. So let your Reason cause itself no pain, and if some other part of you is in trouble, it can form its own judgement for itself.",Stoicism,1702802758.0,t3_18kd228,0.5,0
About substances such as caffeine and energy drinks.,"Caffeine is a substance that brings us physical benefits, such as mood and energy, which is especially useful for those who maintain a physical exercise routine.  However, it is addictive and if consumed in excess can cause death.  The same could be said with energy drinks, which have high doses of caffeine.  What kind of attitude would a Stoic take towards this substance?  Consume it, with the aim of reaching your peak in your training, or abstain from this practice?  What actually differentiates a caffeine consumer from a cocaine addict, metaphysically speaking?",Stoicism,1702738241.0,t3_18jssj8,0.78,17
Stoicism for Action,"These are four principles I've written up for myself regarding Stoic action, expressing my view that Stoicism demands service to others in order to live in accordance with nature. 

I've followed each with a personal description and some of my favorite quotes regarding the matter, and included some various links to relevant articles (I <3 Donald Robertson). This is not meant to be a comprehensive defense of that view but sharing my personal reflections on it. 

&#x200B;

1. [The Common Good](https://modernstoicism.com/perspectives-the-stoics-on-the-community-of-humankind/) —> All our aims and actions should be directed towards benefitting the common good, as is in line with natural conduct and the path of virtuous action. We are temperate and courageous so we may [advocate for justice](https://www.orionphilosophy.com/stoic-blog/the-stoic-virtue-of-justice), not for tranquility or our own happiness.
   1. The pursuit of virtue, of justice among people, is that of virtuous action. To act with love, kindness, and compassion towards all others as one humanity; to engage, not withdraw, from public involvement.
   2. *“Born for society, \[the Stoics\] all believed it was their destiny to labor for it; with so much the less fatigue, their rewards were all inside themselves. Happy by their philosophy alone, it seemed as if only the happiness of others could increase theirs.”* (Montesquieu, The Spirit of Laws, 1748)
   3. *“Revere the gods, and look after each other. Life is short — the fruit of this life is a good character and acts for the common good.”* (Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations*, 6.30)
   4. *""The primary mission of the Stoics, in other words, is to be helpful to others and serve the greater good, and they don't do this to make themselves happy. They do it becaues it is the right and natural way to live. But doing it in that spirit, as it turns out, makes them happy.""* (Ward Farnsworth, *The Practicing Stoic*, 208)
   5. *""\[Happiness is found indirectly in the pursuit of other things, which as\] proposed by the Stoic consists primarily of a dedication to reason and a commitment to others -- to service, to justice, to helping in the ways one can.""* (Ward Farnsworth, *The Practicing Stoic*, 209)  

2. [**The Reserve Clause**](https://donaldrobertson.name/2013/02/02/action-with-a-reserve-clause-in-marcus-aurelius/) —> Engaging with the world of indifferents, we must act with detachment: We shall do our utmost to serve the common good, “Fate permitting.”
   1. To succeed or to fail does not make us virtuous. To act energetically in the name of good intentions is all we have the choice of doing. With a reserve clause, a life of pursuing and falling short of justice is still the noblest path.
   2. *“Try persuasion first, but even though men would say to you not to, act when the principles of justice direct you to. If anyone one should obstruct you by force, take refuge in being contented and without emotional pain, and use the obstacle for the display of some other virtue. Remember that the impulse you had was with an “reserve clause”, and your aim was not to do the impossible.”* (*Meditations*, 6.50)
   3. *“Though a man may in some sort hinder my activity, yet on my own voluntary impulses and mental attitude no fetters can be put because of the “reserve clause” and their ability to adapt to circumstances. For everything that stands in the way of its activity is adapted and transmuted by the mind into furtherance of it, and that which is a check on this action is converted into a help to it, and that which is a hindrance in our path goes but to make it easier.”* (*Meditations*, 5.20)  

3. [**Virtue in**](https://donaldrobertson.name/2018/05/15/the-stoic-socrates-four-emotional-resilience-strategies/) **& through Adversity** —> The world provides us with challenges so that we may test ourselves, become more virtuous and capable, and learn to find the value in all that may happen. We have virtues to face challenges; by facing challenges, we become virtuous. 
   1. We are to recognize and love the necessity of obstacles; appreciate our natural ability to confront and overcome it; seek the chance to prove and train ourselves, and find the humor and purpose granted by reversals.
   2. [Life as a “ball game”:](https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/stoicism-as-a-ball-game/) We seek to play with care and respect for other players, acknowledge their efforts to defeat us with calm, and exert ourselves fully with skill *and* neutrality towards the outcome.  A challenge to play well, not flip out. (1)
   3. *“Good men work, spend and are spent, and they do so willingly. Fortune does not drag them; they follow, and keep step.”* (Seneca, On Providence 5.4)
   4. *“This is no misfortune,; to bear it nobly, rather, is good fortune.”* (*Meditations* 4.49)
   5. “*And yet life, Lucilius, is really a battle. For this reason those who are tossed about at sea, who proceed uphill and downhill over toilsome crags and heights, who go on campaigns that bring the greatest danger, are heroes and front-rank fighters; but persons who live in rotten luxury and ease while others toil, are mere turtle-doves safe only because men despise them.”* (Seneca, *Moral Letters to Lucilius*, 96)  

4. [Stoic Joy](https://donaldrobertson.substack.com/p/three-sources-of-happiness-in-stoicism) —> It is in the activities of virtuous pursuit that we find cause to be joyful regarding our own virtue, the virtues of others, and joy in our lot in the world.
   1. We need not suppress our disappointments and frustrations, but rather recognize that they do not undermine the importance of virtuous action. With detachment and present-mindedness, they are easily endurable. 
   2. To the Stoic, virtue alone is sufficient for happiness under any circumstances. It is a rewarding experience to serve others, and enjoy exercising our ability to do so. We may find pleasure in acting out our natural function. 
   3. *“A man when he has done a good act, does not call out for others to come and see, but he goes on to another act, as a vine goes on to produce again the grapes in season.”* (Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations* 5.6)
   4. *""...Happiness is not supposed to be the Stoic goal, not even covertly. The Stoic view, rather, is that one should embrace virtue for its own sake, and that doing so is necessary to get the good side effects of it.""* (Ward Farnsworth, *The Practicing Stoic*, 209)  
 

Thanks for reading! Happy to discuss in the comments as usefully as I am able (fate permitting ;). 

Also, if you have any good articles on how challenges *develop* virtue, please share them and I'll add them to this post -- it seems like a major theme for [Seneca](https://www.stoicinsights.com/senecas-death-and-the-transformation-of-adversity/) and [Epictetus](https://academyofideas.com/2019/02/psychology-of-resilience/) to my mind, but most articles I found focused on philosophical coping mechanisms rather than Stoic virtue creation.

How do I stop expecting things from people/the world?,"I’m very much new to stoicism, I’ve started reading the important texts but I haven’t gotten very deep yet.

Also I’m aware that some people here are bothered by relationship drama stuff, but here I’m just using it as the most convenient and relevant example.

My partner of 5 years left me for someone else. I haven’t been the perfect partner for her, but I supported her through many trials, made sacrifices for the relationship, etc. Obviously given how she left me for someone else and wasn’t very kind or caring towards me through the break-up process. Regardless of how much I understand how it’s irrational to expect her to treat me more “fairly” and be more grateful for the things I did and sacrificed for her throughout our relationship, deep down I can’t help but do expect it from her and be upset that she did not. Of course this is just one example, as since getting more into stoicism I noticed how much I expect from people and the world and how much energy and words I waste being upset at things/people not turning out how I would want them to. I tell myself and the rational “part” of my brain understands that it’s foolish to wish for a fig in winter. But deeper inside my soul I still cry out for the fig. I’m not sure how stoics are able to rewire themselves to stop wishing for it. Are there exercises for this specifically?

Any help would be appreciated, thank you.",Stoicism,1702718739.0,t3_18jnmtf,0.91,9

How Would a Stoic Deal With a Conservative Religious Family?,"Hi all, I'm a 21 Y.O. living in the UK.  


Roughly 3 years ago, I accepted to myself that I am no longer a Muslim, but rather an agnostic. I kept this hidden from my family, even when they knew that I had a lot of doubts and questions concerning Islam. They demand that I pray all 5 of my daily prayers with them, that I attend religious classes and that I cut ties with any non-religious friends that I may have.  


Fast-forward to today. I have a decent paying job, I have a tenancy agreement for an apartment that I can move into within the next month, and there's a lot of tension that's hard to avoid between my family and I. I believe that moving out will help in raising my self-esteem and my ability to be honest with my parents. They're worried that I'll condemn myself to hell if I don't work on increasing my knowledge when it comes to Islam, and that me considering moving out is a sign that I'm looking to part ways with my family. I've tried to ease their worries by telling them that I'd visit every weekend or so and that my main reason for moving out is to commute into work easier, but all I'm met with are tears, scoldings and guilt-tripping. 

Their actions are understandable. I've told them that I still share their faith, even if I have tons of doubts. They believe that the doubts will only go away once I've submitted myself to god and worked on gaining knowledge in Islam. But the truth is, I have no intention of exploring Islam. I don't want to live the double-life wherein I pretend to be someone I'm not around my family. I understand that telling my family that I'm no longer Muslim could lead to shunning and disownment , but I recognize that this is something I'll have to do. 

I'm feeling a lot of pressure from my siblings, which i find incredibly troubling to deal with. I'm not sure how I can deal with the accusations that I'm causing my parents a lot of suffering, and that It's within my best interests to work on fulfilling their criteria (spending more time with family, going to prayers more often, etc) before moving out. What I haven't told them is that the stress of having to put up a facade around them has lead to me isolating myself from the family. My siblings hold me responsible for my parent's sadness, and that I should forget about the tenancy agreement for the apartment and never bring it up with my parents again.

I'm unsure of what to do next. Part of me believes that I should notify my parents that I've signed the tenancy agreement, move out and then work on telling my family that I'm agnostic. Part of me sees that me bringing it up would only cause pain and more tension, so therefore I shouldn't tell them and I should work on moving out without them noticing.  


What would your stoic tips be for dealing with a situation like this? Would it be acceptable for me to lie about not signing the tenancy agreement to avoid conflict? 

*(TL;DR: Left Islam. Now living a double-life around family. Unsure if I should tell my family that I've decided to move out)*

My logic for ending it,"I have really screwed up life for me and my partner.  I got her pregnant and now just lost my job because of my incompetence and I’ll doubt I’ll get another job in the same field.  I’m also severely depressed.  She is 4 months pregnant.  I think the only way to help her and this child is to take myself out of the picture.  I have some savings and I could leave it all to her and the kid to use.  It could last them a few years.  

I think this is the best course of action.  I’m not sure what I’m looking for from this post.  Perhaps some reassurance in my logic to not be a burden to anyone.   Thanks.",Stoicism,1702679069.0,t3_18jc116,0.58,20

On Anger,"We all get angry, and stoics would argue that it's how we control that emotion is the important part. But I read this quote and it hit me as a connection I had never made before: ""Anger is an emotional response to an unfulfilled expectation."" I realized how true that was - that when I felt anger it was because something was not happening the way I felt it should.

However this then begged the question: ""So do we then not have any expectations, if we don't want to feel anger?"" Not very realistic, and nihilistic really, which I don't think is any real way to live, but! If you have 0 expectations for anyone or anything then you no longer deal with anger.

So then is it better to temper expectations AND control the emotion of anger?

But if the goal is to \*feel\* less anger; then simply controlling it, isn't really the answer either. I apologize for my rambling - I'm just trying to write down what has been rolling around in my head for the last little bit.

How stoics deals with racism?,"I come from oppressed community in India, we're still treated like trash in my country. I want to do good things for the people not just for mine but for everyone. But the criticism and everything stops me and makes me anxious.

Although I haven't experienced discrimination directly. But I read it online about growing violence against our community. I have experienced it indirectly a lot. I tried to be best for my whole life and I succeeded in that too, I topped my school and college. People say that I am mediocre Dalit and that whatever I get is because of reservations (which is a special law for giving equal opportunity for oppressed communities, by allowing equal representation of people in education and other areas, like affirmative action). Think of Jews living in ghettos during ww2 Germany (I don't mean to offend anyone nor I am associating with worst tragedy in history, it's just the growing violence scares me and I can resonate with that event). Because of this and reading about violence, I hardly talk to anyone because I am scared to be out in public. I stopped going out for dates and asking out many years ago, cuz I am afraid that it will end badly and no one wants to get married and associated with a ""Dalit"". I am too scared of achieving my goals because everything in India is based on casteism, I may not find a house on rent because my caste. It's just bad here.

I used to lie in school about my caste.

Even though it happened it hasn't turned me into a bitter person. I respect every individual and empathize with others. I control my anger nor do I argue with someone who calls me names or makes fun of my community and call us scums. It's just that I am scared to do anything. Because if I achieve something in life I will be known as ""Dalit boy who... achieved something"" not a ""College boy who... achieved something"" or ""Engineering student who... achieved something""

If I have to do something I have to stay in limits because that may exploit my caste and people will bash my family for this reason.

Stoicism as an ever evolving philosophy,"In my mind, stoicism must evolve and change with the times to remain relevant. Marcus Aurelius, one of the most quoted and beloved stoic thinkers would most likely not fit the mold of how we think of stoics today. Despite being a man that pursued virtue as the highest importance he owned slaves. Would owning a slave today fit our judgment of what it means to be Just, one of the touchstones of stoic philosophy? I certainly hope not! People are a product of their time and their experiences. Times change and our notion of what it means to be just, temperate, wise and courageous must change with them.",Stoicism,1702626242.0,t3_18iuv7w,0.8,9
Marcus Aurelius teaches to not complain; I kinda disagree.,"The quote goes ""Don't be overhead complaining... not even to yourself"" -Marcus Aurelius, 8.9.  

Complaining is all about emotional expression. when an emotion is dominating your mind it becomes easy to become hopeless, and feel like you cannot fix the problem. When you vent out this emotion (complaining is an easy way to do that), it allows your brain to operate clearly and it removes that burden from your mind. So id wager it's more beneficial to complain in moderation than to not most of the time. Also, from my experience it's a great ice breaker, an easy way to relate to other people, and often doesn't come off as annoying.

Stoic advice for the probable loss of a pet?,"I've been reading about stoicism for about a year now and its had a huge impact on my mental health, however recently my ability to put it to use has been tested to say the least. 

This may seem trivial compared to other peoples problems, but I have a young cat (soon to be five y/o) who I may lose in the near future. He has a condition he has to be medicated for and this medication has a long list of probable side effects, the biggest one being another illness where I have decided that I would rather put him down than make him go through that treatment.

This is not a 100% certanity, but it is indeed a very probable risk and I cannot stop worrying, waiting and bracing myself for the heartache of having to decide to let him go. I have had more time than many others have gotten and I try to be thankful for this and to appreciate each day instead of thinking about the next, but this is constantly on my mind and I feel so sad and anxious about it.

Seeing things just as they are,"Hello everybody. 
Lately I've been advancing in my studies of Stoicism and I've come to a realization, more of the development of a skill actually. Lately I have been able to see things the way they are. What do I mean by this?

Someone says an insult. Is it good? Bad? It was just an insult, or more radically, just words that were cataloged negatively by us.

Someone outplayed you? They just did a certain action. Now it is up to you to cataloge it in a way.
 
Do you feel frustration? It was just a feeling that makes you stay alert and feel weird things, not necessarily bad. 

After meditating on this new skill that I have been developing, I was very confused how should I use it in a way that is constructive, for the Virtue, for the community and for my path. Now I realize that insults are starting to lose meaning for me, therefore they start to mean less and less, it's just words, and now I feel some kind of power, like ""I can do whatever I want with that insult"". Destructive behaviors, the same. I have been gradually overcoming that confusion through Stoic ethics, at least the few I've studied about it. I decide to use this for what I judge to be good, the justice, for the community, for my learning and development path. It is interesting. Have any of you experienced this before?

Antipater,"I see a lot of people seeking advice so I thought I would switch things up with some food for thought. Stoicism seems to be perceived as an all or nothing philosophy that encourages us to not feel and discourages us when we fall short. This doesn’t have to be the case. Antipater, the 6th leader of the stoic school formed by Zeno, took the philosophy in another direction than his predecessors by loosening some of the absolutist rules that had been laid before him. Early stoics held that all sins were wrong and equal. Antipater rejected this notion recognizing that stealing a loaf of bread is not the same as murdering the baker for the bread. In Lives of the Stoics, by Stephen Hanselman and Ryan Holiday, they compare the modern stoic to an archer. “We train and practice. We draw back the arrow and aim it to the best of our abilities. But we know full well that despite our training and our aim, many factors outside our control will influence where the arrow hits the target-or if it falls short entirely. We take action. But much happens after that-much of it is not remotely up to us. Which is why we know that our true worth does not reside in whether or not we get a bullseye.”  I thought that was a fitting analogy. Something to think on, something I wanted to share.",Stoicism,1702600428.0,t3_18inafj,0.63,5
Should I be always trying to think if I did the most virtue thing that I could?,"I was thinking about that: Should I be, after all actions, thinking about them and questioning myself if it was the best action i could take or should I simply focus on trying to take the best action and later on on the day, maybe evening, I stop and think about that while journaling or meditating, and focusing the judgment of my action on this period of the day? That came to my mind because a lot of times I end up being caught on my own thoughts in the mid of the day trying to judge some action of mine and this leads to more untoughtful actions.

Having trouble reading Epictetus,"Hi,

I've read The Meditations (and loved it) so I wanted to see what Epictetus had to say as well. I got to about chapter 18 (or I18?) in book 1 and honestly I'm just confused at this point. 

I understand the Discourses are, well, discourses and not really a book written by Epictetus himself, but still I find his arguments being rather confusing and messy. Not very clear. 

For example: Chapter, 17, is titled ""concerning the necessity of logic"" (I got the penguin classics edition). Epictetus starts by presenting a problem/paradox - reason can only be analyzed either by itself or by something superior, however ""there is nothing superior to reason"" and reason cannot analyze itself because it creates an endless loop. Then he goes on to address a claim (hypothetical or from someone in the audience? i'm not sure) saying that regardless, emotions are more important than logic, only to show that it isn't the case and that no debate could be held with rules set by emotions.

So, he says, we use logic to define the terms in which we analyze things and discuss among ourselves (but how is that related to the paradox at the begging?). Then he goes on to argue against another claim against logic and then he ends up with talking about understanding nature, some victim of something unclear and then God and a philosopher's power of interpretation.

Of course it's much more complicated but I tried to keep it short XD

So as you can see, this is what I got from this chapter. Honestly I don't understand what he was trying to say and it's the same in most of the other chapters. He seems a bit all-over-the-place for me.

I wanted to know if other readers faced the same problem or is it just me? Is he getting clearer in following chapters? Maybe you could give me tips on how to read Epictetus, maybe I'm missing something?

Thanks!",Stoicism,1702629634.0,t3_18ivnaq,0.6,1
"If emotions seem to be a natural result of the body, why are we trying to control them so much?","There's a concept in stoicism that we should control that which we can, and accept those things which we cannot.  But can we really control the fact we feel emotions?  I've never met anyone who doesn't experience them, and personally they feel very instant and inevitable.  It seems like to me, I have an inevitable emotion, and then a controllable, separate, external reaction to it.

To me, once I'm already feeling an emotion, it makes it much worse to try and suppress it.  So I kind of just give myself permission to feel whatever naturally comes.  Letting myself be okay with not being okay is deeply liberating and has really been centering to me emotionally, but it seems this isn't the majority consensus on the stoic treatment of emotions, and me admitting to others I'm feeling certain emotions isn't stoic at all.  But when I do this, I feel much more calm and controlled, and the emotions I do have are smaller on the outside.

So I wanted to ask if there's an appropriately stoic way to see this.  I've been reading Epictetus and so far nothing in the enchiridion goes against what I'm saying.  But it seems this is not the common interpretation of the content, and that most have a concept of a stoic being a sort of iceman/woman

I'm interested to see what others think about this, so I thought I would ask.",Stoicism,1702565145.0,t3_18ia6v6,0.87,21
Ignorant about my own possessions?,"I don't know. Epictetus calls it superfluous to recieve land, money and a magisterial office when we all naturally posses their equivalent. Calls it an act of someone ignorant of their own possessions.

Regarding receiving(from oneself) Greatness of soul(whatever this means) and generosity of spirit(like feeding your mind a good book or spending time in the company of someone you consider wise), what  Stoic practices come to mind, that make it easy to consider land, money and a magisterial office unnecessary?, taking into consideration the things neccessary to human life that money provides.",Stoicism,1702583413.0,t3_18igzfb,1.0,7
Being ok with saying goodbye,"My parents are seperated but they’re both alcoholics. My dad is worse, he lost his great career like 8 years ago, lost a few jobs after that, been to detox over 5 times in the past 5 years but he keeps going back to drinking. 

I moved from one place back to my hometown to help him and hopefully get him clean, at this point I’m over it. He’s getting kicked out of his place soon and I’m heading back across the country to finally focus on my own life. I always felt like I have to go out of my way to parent my parents but I’ve delayed my own career and life for them. 

When I move I don’t plan to come back, unless to visit. Leaving means, like everyday, he (or anybody in the world) may pass. I feel like I’ve tried what I can do but he needs to fix himself as we all do. My parents were great when I was growing up then fell down these dark holes when I entered adulthood. If they were terrible parents I could leave easier and never look back. 

I just want to walk away and not feel guilty for leaving, especially if something happens.

"""There is nothing fearful in nature for the rational man""","I've come across this quote in a lecture about Marcus Aurelius ( Michael Sugrue). Quotes like this and others

""He who fears death will never do anything worth of a man who is alive"" - Seneca.

underscore  the paralyzing effect of fear. I often find myself hesitating to do stuff held back by the uncertainty and anxiety surrounding the unknown, so by fear. Most of these fears are irrational. Quotes like this remind that life is meant to be lived and always avoiding things u fear kills u in a metaphorical sense. And if worse comes to worst injury, death or other losses are all just part of nature and therefore not anything to be afraid of.

Anyone else share this experience?

My mind goes nuts over a choice that I didn't have,"I want to embrace stoicism, but my mind keeps pointing me back to my ""old"" ways. 

This is the weirdest most recent example: 
I recently started a new job. Part of that was getting a company car. Normally you'd order one from the 3 choices the company has for you, these are mainly the cheapest versions of cars. With the push to ev's however this means I can only choose electric cars. We already have one ev at home and like an ice car as backup, so my only option is getting one from the company pool. 

I had two choices: a few months old ford focus or a 3 years old Opel Astra. I obviously went for the Ford, added bonus is that when i do have to pick an EV i can pick a more matured one. 

Now I have a colleague who was fortunate and could choose one of the last Ice cars. He went for the new Opel Astra. Turns out that basic Astra is way more luxurious than my Ford albeit a bit more expensive. 

My mind now constantly goes into ""what if"" mode. Because of course, my mind believes the new Opel is the better choice. I believe this goes back to my constant persuit of perfection. If i have choices, no matter what they are about, u always try to go for the best and very best one. 

Tl;dr:
My mind is contemplating over a choice I didn't even have. Stoicism tells me that all I have control over is my own judgement, yet my mind can't stop overthinking this. What to do? 

And yes, I know this is a first world problem. I'm happy with the car and very fortunate, but I also want to make clear that I do pay for it.",Stoicism,1702547760.0,t3_18i59ss,0.67,4
A stoic perspective on the irreplaceable,"My Dad passed away suddenly this year. First and foremost he was an amazing father with a deep sense of duty and community. He was a well respected Jungian psychologist both in his practice and as a professor. He was a role model in the relationship he shared with my mom and a man that practiced what he preached. He has been the most influential person in my life.

I’m posting this in hope that someone else may find value in my reflections on how stoicism influenced my thoughts around his passing. 

————

When we accept that we have been deprived of something we once had, our next logical instinct is to choose one of the following courses of action: find it, replace it, or do without it.

When something irreplaceable is taken, we cannot find it again because it exists nowhere else. We cannot replace it, as that is the definition of irreplaceable. Then, we are seemingly left with only one option: to do without. What may seem as the lesser of three outcomes is the most beautiful. 

When we accept the nature of what was given back as irreplaceable we can only choose to do without. Once that choice is made we can be at peace with what was given back. We no longer struggle to find what we had again or recreate it. Accepting that we will never have what we had ever again is not a lamentation, it is a testament to how beautiful and special it was. 

We must see ourselves as artists and what is gone as our work of art. We may enjoy creating the work, admire its shape as it takes form, and even the struggle to make it beautiful. The complete and refined beauty of our work can only be seen after we are finished with it. Our appreciation for what we created is deepened when we know every step that formed it.

We shouldn’t look back at what we had and wish we still had it. We now have the privilege to look back on it as completed. We get to admire how beautiful our journey with it was from start to finish. Our focus is on how grateful we are that fate allowed us to have something so precious at all, regardless of duration. 

It’s the rarest joy to give back something that cannot be replaced.

> With regard to whatever objects give you delight, are useful, or are deeply loved, remember to tell yourself of what general nature they are, beginning from the most insignificant things. If, for example, you are fond of a specific ceramic cup, remind yourself that it is only ceramic cups in general of which you are fond. Then, if it breaks, you will not be disturbed. If you kiss your child, or your wife, say that you only kiss things which are human, and thus you will not be disturbed if either of them dies.

"A short review, and a question, regarding unearned wisdom in the modern era. Would love to hear your thoughts.","UNEARNED WISDOM IN THE MODERN ERA

Growing up and living in the modern era provides a unique experience, compared to our ancestors’, in respect to the accessibility of information. In a world where we are more interconnected than ever before, we are blessed to have instant and untethered access to knowledge and information in mere seconds, through use of the internet.

Lessons that once took a near lifetime to learn can be easily accessed by keyboard. Endless archives of wisdom, built upon through the ages, as a result of hard work and discipline, hand us the opportunity to learn and grow on a silver platter.

Herein the problem lies, many of us are constantly looking outwards for answers, or worse yet, outsourcing a sense of purpose and growth, subcontracting the hard work and toil required to gain such wisdom, and condensing said effort into mere seconds, leaving us overstimulated, desensitised, and none-the-wiser.

Knowledge, without practical application, is almost useless. That is, unless your goal is to *sound* like someone who has their life together. But actions speak louder than words, and eventually these pseudo-sages will demonstrate their lack of self control.

So, then the question remains, how do you pick the low-hanging fruit of the modern day world, and turn it into actual, practical wisdom?

Wisdom can be defined as *‘the quality of having experience, knowledge and good judgement’.*

In order to reach good judgement, we must first possess the knowledge, which can be unlocked through the experience.

Here is a step-by-step process for effectively gaining accurate wisdom through experience:

**Step One**

A certain event will happen, which has a significant outcome, either expected or not. The more intensely positive, or negative, the experience is, the more valuable information there may be to learn, and the higher levels of emotion that may be produced as a by-product.

**Step Two**

Reflection on the experience, if possible including the ability to compare it to others, the vision to explore other possible outcomes, creating knowledge. Reflection must come from an emotionally stable perspective, otherwise it can distort the lesson which remains to be learned.

For example, a start-up business which fails, losing a lot of money, will be a highly emotional event, but inside will be a treasure trove of knowledge and experience, which could undoubtedly help in the future.

Concerning pearls of wisdom, it should be known, that in order to claim the precious gemstone from the tightly clasped oyster, your fingers will get sore and bloodied in the process.

If the event is reviewed from an emotionally driven perspective, the person involved may say: “I knew my colleagues were right, I am not cut out to be a businessman, I should have just stayed in my previous job.”

But this does not give much, if any, useful feedback. It just provides an emotional reasoning as to why the event unfolded this way, rather than a logical situational report which can better guide us in the future.

And this kind of emotional response is not only negatively-based, for example if the same new business was instantly a huge success, perhaps the emotionally driven reflection would be: “I am so great at opening businesses. I must have the golden touch!” – creating a false sense of genius in oneself, leading to overreaching and under-preparing later on.

In order to be successful and accurate in your reflection of events, you must be emotionally removed. This can take time, to detach yourself from the immediacy of the situation, but necessary in order to have an impartial perspective.

**Step Three**

The ability to judge new situations, and modify choices or behaviour based on the knowledge gained from previous experience, thus defining wisdom.

In order to be able to draw on such knowledge, like in the previous step, you must begin with an emotionally stable frame-of-mind. With a higher risk or reward relying on the outcome of the event in question, the situation will become more emotionally charged, making emotional detachment more difficult, creating a reaction, rather than an action.

With this step-by-step of earning wisdom through experience, the question stands. Not all those who are experienced are wise, but is it possible to become wise without experience? How do you absorb the wisdom of lessons which you haven’t lived yourself?",Stoicism,1702468375.0,t3_18hf56u,0.57,1
The concept of virtue is circular,"Stoics advocate for following virtue, but what how might one define what is virtuous? A stoic would respond: ""that which results in your contentment/ what is in your nature.""   


The skeptic would rightly reply, ""what makes you content?""   


The Stoic would reply: ""That which uses the right reason""  


And on and on the circular reasoning goes. Without defining what contentment is or what the right reason is, this is a never ending circle and doesn't mean anything.   


Another counterargument: that which is just, wise, moderate and courageous is what makes you content.   


The skeptic would reply ""Why are those things virtues and not something else?"" And there is no answer.   


Finally, a Stoic might say something like: ""That which is good for you is the right use of reason""  


The skeptic would reply: ""But you just said that the only thing good for me is the right use of reason. If the only thing that is good is reason, then why is what is good for you the right use of reason? In other words, doing what is good is the right use of judgement, but you haven't actually defined what is good. Without defining what is good, then what makes it a good judgement?"" As you can see, there is circular reasoning once again.

If someone could clear up these counterarguments, that would be greatly appreciated. ",Stoicism,1702415807.0,t3_18gwn2c,0.75,9
How much mental energy or thought process does practicing Stoicism take up?,"BTW: I wasn't sure if I should be putting this in the ""New to Stoicism"" or in ""Seeking Stoic Advice"" - I've only been interested in Stoicism as a means for dealing with my own circumstances for the past year or so.

For some context: I struggle with the actual practicing of Stoicism, mostly due to having ADHD (mostly the Inattentive type).  Despite trying to work on it, I can often find the impulsive nature of my mind engages way too quickly.  If I'm in a 'hyperfocused' state regarding Stoicism, I can manage that a little better - but the effort it seems to take mentally is exhausting.

So:

I don't think I've seen this discussed - but how much time and effort is spent mentally going over the practice of being Stoic?  I am aware in CBT there are often things like half-hour daily exercises, but these are really more transformative things that are designed to work over longer periods.  To me, Stoicism is more a 'way of life' kind of philosophy and thinking - reacting to and interpreting situations and circumstances constantly.

That constant examination and practice seems exhausting to me.  I'm the kind of person who can become mentally exhausted after doing a client meeting, or having a slightly busier day, or just one of those days where my brain decides to inner monologue about anything and everything constantly.  Add to that all the little rules I have to follow otherwise I'll lose things, forget things and generally mess my day up horribly.  I often have to force myself to mono-task and try to keep focus even doing a simple thing like making a cup of tea or a sandwich.

This is all compounded by my seeing this quote of Epictetus: ""Don't explain your philosophy.  Embody it."" when I've been searching for some kind of guidance.  To me, to embody something is to take it on completely, utterly - it becomes ***everything***.

I guess alternatively - what is a good balance of applying Stoic principles in your mind over just letting things flow naturally to see how well the practices are taking hold? 

(In my life, and mind, if I'm not actively thinking about a process, then that process can very much not exist at all.  So coming into a situation where I *could* practice a Stoic principle, I'll forget that I can and instead do something else, and on reflection, something worse.)

I hope this makes sense, it's really hard for me to put down into words exactly what I'm trying to get across (and I'm sure I've probably missed some obvious point I should have made lol).",Stoicism,1702425079.0,t3_18h1dcc,0.7,6

Stoicism for giving birth,"
I'm going to be giving birth in a few weeks. What advice does Stoic philosophy have for me? Has anyone on here faced this experience and found Stoic perspectives helpful?

I plan to use pain medication in combination with other coping techniques - I find it most helpful personally to think of childbirth as lying along the spectrum of human experience that we can bring the resources of humanity (modern medicine!) to bear against, rather than a primal/natural event that my body will handle in a way separate from other parts of my life. (Dying is also part of the human experience, and people with a choice in the matter rarely form a goal of ""getting through it without unnatural interventions."") But I also understand that people feel many ways about this topic, and have a great admiration for people who pursue an unmedicated delivery - please don't make this post into a war about which of these approaches is ""more Stoic.""

Even though I expect to get an epidural, the education and medical advice I've gotten are consistent in recommending to delay epidurals until fairly late in the game (or at least it seems late to me) to avoid slowing labor. Epidurals can also fail or turn out to be unavailable for a variety of reasons. So I know I'm in for ??? hours of steadily increasing discomfort and pain, in an altered mental and hormonal state I haven't experienced before.  I also have never had my pain tolerance tested to an extreme degree, and know that pain tolerance and the experience of what labor feels like varies hugely. 

I vacilate between using voluntary discomfort as opportunities to practice not-suffering, and trying not to borrow worry/suffering from the future by going too nuts with it. I hold a lot of ice cubes and long yoga poses, and have access to good resources for specific mental management techniques for handling contractions.

Stoic perspectives have been very helpful to me during pregnancy, both for pregnancy symptoms (treatable and untreatable) and for thinking about upcoming labor.  There is a lot I can't control both about things that are inevitable (pain) and things that are unknowable (what complications arise, if I have back labor or require other medical interventions, if my epidural fails) - and it's very freeing to realize this means that me ruminating about it won't change anything. 

I don't have a significant formal background in stoic philosophy, so I'd be grateful for both your own impressions as well as specific topics, concept names, or readings that might be relevant. I am interested in any male or female perspectives on this question, so long as they don't amount to ""women just have some kind of special sauce for going through childbirth and they forget it afterward!"" 

(This question is inspired by the ""voluntary discomfort"" post, and a look through the archives suggests there's only been a few posts on this topic ever. This is my 'pregnancy' reddit account and I'm a regular reader of r/Stoicism on my main account.)",Stoicism,1702386508.0,t3_18glhl9,0.88,25
Breakup Guilt,"Hello,

Six months ago my boyfriend left me. I was very emotional in the relationship, driven by my insecurities. This led him to cheat and then abandon me and cut contact completely.

I’m struggling to understand the stoic texts,"Per this sub I started reading the Dialogues of Epictetus. I just finished chapter one of book one and am very confused. 

Some of his sentences make total sense to me, but others are very confusing. For example, it starts off with “Of all the faculties, you will find not one which is capable of contemplating itself; and, consequently, not capable either of approving or disapproving.“ This just leaves me confused. What are all the faculties? He then gives the example of grammatic art and music as faculties that can’t contemplate themselves. And the “rational faculty” as the only one that can. I’m confused what specifically this even is.

Why should the Stoic not be self indulgent?,"Hello all,

I am reading through Meditations for the first time and early on he mentions that one thing he learned from his adopted father was not to be too self indulgent and he admired that he had, “no concern for food, or the cut and color of his clothes, or having attractive slaves.”

My understanding is that stoicism teaches us how to better handle adversity and how to carry yourself in a way that others can respect. I don’t understand why caring about how you present yourself would negatively impact the Stoic. 

I agree that flaunting wealth or the material possessions you have as being anti stoic but I don’t see how private self indulgence is.",Stoicism,1702397545.0,t3_18gpgx6,0.67,6
How do you practice not trying to get stressed out about things out of your control? Is that missing the point?,"I have a bumpy relationship with my mother. She frequently burns bridges with people and is generally negative and depressing to be around. She burned a bridge with my fiance last year, and generally has a bad relationship with my sister. This xmas we will all be spending it in separate locations (which is fine with me given the situation) but my mom is being super negative about it because she believes the 24th is ""her"" time to have us at her house. Long story short, shes tough to be around and pushes people away but still wants us to spend time with her.

I called her today to invite her to our house for xmas, since my sister would be away and I know my mom has no one else to spend xmas with (other than her husband and his family). She says she will be spending xmas with them and goes on a low key rant about how we won't be with her and how we don't want to go over to her house anymore, etc. I even tell her that we will plan to all be at her house next year, and she replies with ""yeah if im even alive next year"". Like, that is some straight up emotional abuse right there lol.

I dreaded calling her. I had anxiety thinking about the conversation. This is not right. I am not making any rash decisions because of this, in part thanks to stoicism. I understand this is out of my control and that I cannot change how she feels/acts/talks. The thing I don't like is still being stressed out about it. The dread. The anxiety. Am I missing the point of stoicism if I'm still trying to figure out how to remove those emotions?",Stoicism,1702417615.0,t3_18gxd92,0.67,2
"Social media toxicity, R/vegan, and what should I do.","So I am recently new to Reddit, again. I was on reddit back in  2012 to 2014, but stopped until this year. I like how Reddit is mostly more positive, especially compared to the toxicity of Facebook. 
I have found great communities from books, dogs, satellite radio fans, to philosophy.
But something recently left a bad taste in my mouth. I am vegetarian and try mostly for a vegan diet due to my morality with animals. Not preaching this is just my personal beliefs, but I feel this is important information for the story.
So anyways I also joined R/vegan.
I posted a few times on the subreddit and recently I posted an article entitled ""Veganism is in crisis, and the fanatics can only blame themselves"" and asked what the people what they thought of the criticism. Just because I was curious. I did not write the article.
But I would say about 40% to 45% started to attack me personally or my online persona I guess.
I like to think I have tuff skin and shit posters and trolls don't bother me, but this time it kind of did.
I was just asking what people thoughts were and to start a discussion. I didn't give my opinion of the article and I have been posting on the board for awhile. 
But almost half of them seemed mad at me, I tried to defend myself, but they didn't seem to care. After a few responses I realized I was just wasting my time and deleted my post and blocked a few people. 
I had my wife look at the post and she says it did not look offensive or anything like that, but I do admit she could be biased.
I was really starting to like Reddit with the discussions. But R/vegan makes me question if I should give up social media in general. I don't know. 
I like the discussions, but I am getting to old to deal with shit posters all the time. I am not sure if this was a one time fluke, a vegan thing (I am not unrealistic, I know how they can be sometimes), a reddit thing, or just people...

Stoicism - Reading the news or not?,"I've been involved with stoicism for about a year now. Reading books, listening to podcasts, watching videos etc. I feel like I have successfully applied rules and values to my life. I am definitely less angry, my short temper is gone, I'm able to smile more, I accept things for who or what they are, I generally feel better etc.

Recently, I had had a discussion with a friend of mine. He isn't as involved in stoicism, but he knows what it is and it's core values.

He asked me about an event that happened in the world, and I told him I wasn't aware of it, because I don't read the news. He asked why, and I told him that the news make me angry, thus I avoid it. Although, I still read news I find interesting that doesn't upset me, like technology and some entertainment news.

He told me that he can read the news and not get angry, and stay neutral regardless of what he's reading. That's definitely not me. The news themselves, and how the media stirs the pot and presents the news, it's a breeding ground for anger. So I avoid it, and in return I'm happier, with the blowback of not staying as informed about the world (which can be a blessing and a curse).

My friend told me that a TRUE stoic, would be able to read any news and stay neutral, and me avoiding the news isn't what a stoic person should do. A stoic person should block out external things while staying informed. He argued that I should train myself to read the news, whatever it is, and stay neutral.

This intrigued me. It felt like a superpower. But me training myself by reading negative news, and forcing myself to stay neutral, sounds awful. I mean, how long would that take?

But first let's get the definition down here. Local news headline: 8-year-old girl sexually assaulted by 3 men. Alright… Do I smash things around me? No. But I carry this news with me in the back of my head, and it's there, making me angrier than I should have been if I didn't read it. It can affect my entire day.

I don't see how a person could read that and stay neutral? In fact, that out right sounds like a psychopath.

What do you think?

EDIT: So many incredible comments. I wasn't expecting to get so dwelled down into stoic theory. This was great. 

Based on a lot of your comments as well as stoic theory, I'm guessing my friend is correct. However, flooding myself with negatiity just to stay informed about world events; isn't something I see as something good. 

Also important to mention is the fact that one news article doesn't upset me, or make me angry, despite the original post making it look like that. I'm talking about watching and reading general media news on a daily basis, and over months or years building a negative mindset. I can read a bad piece of news and brush it off. Should have made that more clear from the start.

I've been heavily informed, and I have been heavily uninformed (current state), and based on my mood and life in general, I prefer to be uninformed. Not MISINFORMED, but UNINFORMED. Reading up in current local news is a good thing. Reading up what happens on the other side of the world does no longer interest me. 

Thank you all for the great discussion!",Stoicism,1702298437.0,t3_18ftnmv,0.8,14
"Is age regression as a man with ADD, GAD and infantile autism a problem?","Hey i have a lot og diagnostics, these 3. I combatted a lot of these with talking 5 min cold showers daily everyday in morning, I also try to run 3 kilometres everyday. I try to go to bed at 11 pm and wake up at 7 am. I drink coffee daily before 12 am, I also take ADD medication and anxiety medication. I write gratitude journal daily, as well as notes and I try to build on myself by doing various activities. Like reading, going to Gym, breathing exercises and more.

I still have addictions, I feel hyper sexual so i masturbait daily. I play computer a lot and I work as much as possible. I love working but my job, isn’t something that I can do daily. Because it’s sort of like a company that finds jobs for me where I can work, and if they need me I’ll be there.

But I also find that I tend to get more addicted to things, I constantly have tendencies of seeing myself as a man child even though I have been told I’m very mature. I seek attention, and I have over reactions and I worry a lot.

I feel like I can’t get out of this rut that I am in, I finished gymnasium. But idk, I feel like I’m inadequate and that I cannot be a man. Like all of my actions have been for nothing, I overcame depression and I finished gymnasium despite having undiagnosed ADHD, anxiety, depression and infantile autism.

Yet I feel like I never accomplished anything, I know I’m not nothing and I know that I’m valuable. But I constantly feel like I have no value, like no one think I’m anything but a mistake. I feel like I can’t be a man, almost like I never had a chance. I know I can do anything and that I can’t stay resilient through pain and suffering, stay composed and be a leader. But I’m constantly being reminded that I’m less valuable than people who haven’t accomplished anything. Idk why I believe that, but what can I do?

What would the stoics have thought about eating animals in modern day?,"After reading meditations, it's clear that Marcus Aurelius was focused on living within his own nature as a human being, and valued the humans ability to reason above everything.

On one hand, eating meat is human nature, we are clearly omnivores and have eaten meat as a species for as long as we've been around. 
However in modern day, eating meat isn't a requirement to live a healthy life, and the mass production of meat is widely thought to be inefficient and cruel, so using reason and the information we have available, eating meat wouldn't be the virtuous choice.

I've just been thinking about this lately, and thought there was a bit of a clash between our nature and our ability to reason in this area. There's probably more stuff like this as the modern world is so different to what was going on back when Marcus was knocking about.",Stoicism,1702292647.0,t3_18fs32u,0.52,4
One major change and some minor changes to the subreddit,"Howdy, we have decided on the small handful of changes described below.

\- **The New Agora**  
In order to better ensure that users seeking Stoic advice receive well-informed, specifically Stoic responses, we have decided to make a major change in the subreddit. Posts with the ""Seeking Stoic Advice"" flair will now be considered as seeking specifically and recognizably Stoic advice. Users who are seeking and offering personal opinions inspired by Stoicism, sharing experiences that may be influenced by Stoicism, or requesting and attempting to administer ""[first aid](https://modernstoicism.com/two-types-of-stoic-therapy-by-john-sellars/)"" will be welcome to do so in the New Agora, a daily pinned thread for these and other types of exchanges (including, for example, casual questions users don't want create posts for and extremely limited self-promotion). The New Agora is not an anything-goes thread; instead, it is for things that may be more tangentially, rather than directly, Stoic. Activity that is way off-base remains unwelcome.  
If your ""Seeking Stoic Advice"" post is removed because you are seeking personal opinions or asking what-would-you-do questions, you may instead post in the New Agora. 

\- **User flairs**  
In the interest of improving communication, we have decided to implement user flairs. In order to receive a user flair, message the moderators with your request. Pending our consensus, informed by our review of your activity, our background knowledge, and/or other factors, we will assign the flair and it will appear beside your username when you are active here. You may apply for flairs in accordance with the most suitable descriptors of your experience or interest. For example, flairs may include ""qualified/trustworthy user,"" ""academic/scholar,"" or ""προκόπτων."" The moderators may also decide to grant flairs to users on their own, without applications in mod messages, pending the user's agreement.

\- **Post flairs**  
As mentioned, the ""Seeking Stoic Advice"" flair is now strictly for seeking well-informed advice strictly drawing from and clearly aligned with Stoic philosophy.The ""Stoic Theory/Study"" flair will now only be assigned by moderators. If you would like to use this flair on your post, use the ""Pending Theory/Study"" flair. This will flag our attention, and we will review your post to determine whether to assign the ""Stoic Theory/Study"" flair. This is intended to prevent the misuse of the flair that is primarily meant for longform, well-informed, and careful posts, rather than pop-philosophy-type content, short personal observations, and newcomer questions.

Things may change, but we are going to move forward and monitor how well things work. If you have any questions, concerns, or other feedback, feel free to let us know.

What are some modern stoic texts you can recommend?,"When I was in 7th grade I read “The seven habits of highly effective people.” I didn’t know it at the time, but that was my first exposure to many of the stoic principles. A couple years later I read “Man’s search for meaning” and that book deeply moved me and taught me so much about the core of stoicism. In 11th grade I read “The Tao of Pooh” and used that book as a my personal spiritual guidebook until I discovered stoicism. When I was introduced to stoicism by the book “a guide to the good life” I felt like I had found a way of living that brought together the fundamental principles that had inspired and spoken to me throughout my life. I still consider myself very new to stoicism as it has only been a year and half since I started seriously studying it. Even so, one of my favorite things to do is to look for parallels in the works of the ancient stoics and that of other books I read, especially fiction. 

What are some modern (as in post enlightenment) texts that you find to be deeply stoic texts? Not stoic commentaries, but actual stand alone projects that teach or demonstrate the principles found within stoicism?",Stoicism,1702252449.0,t3_18fh1r1,0.92,34

Does stoic philosophy provide a justification for the holocaust?,"Good day all, I have this question that I have not been able to google and am keen to hear your opinions. That is, how would a stoic look at the holocaust? Epictetus says ""Things that are not within our own power, not without our Will, can by no means be either good or evil"". So if you were someone within the concentration camp, would you say that the holocaust was neither good nor evil and embrace it? 

He also says ""until you know their reasons, how do you know they’ve acted wrongly"". And the same applies here, if you do not know why a nazi did what he did, how do we say it was wrong? Just because he had orders to kill someone, does not mean there were not anterior motives, motives we are not aware of. 

Please let me know what you think. This community is well more versed in stoic philosophy than I.

Ps. I am of course not trying to justify the holocaust. I am very intrigued by the application of stoic philosophy in the most, to our standards, dire and horrific of scenarios. ",Stoicism,1702379851.0,t3_18gjnav,0.25,0
Does anyone else struggle with feelings of sanctimony and an inflated ego with stoicism?,"Stoicism has helped my life massively, and because  of that I feel like it’s starting to inflate my ego. Anytime I find myself stroking my own ego, I try to bring myself back to reality.

I find arrogant/know it all people to be so incredibly cringe and obtuse, but I can’t help but start to feel that way about myself. Stoicism has changed my life in such a dramatic way, that I can’t help but feel like I know a secret to life that everyone else is ignorant to…and my ego insists on telling me I must be such a special snowflake for possessing the knowledge few others have. I find myself impulsively preaching to others about stoicism and I feel gross after the fact(I will gladly talk about it to those who like to talk philosophy, but others don’t care).

Question about one’s own nature,"Hello,

I was contemplating about the fact that people can have their own ""natures"". For instance, I find that my nature is to provide for a family by having a job and loving/providing for them. Because of that, I studied and got a job to make that happen. 

I find my nature to be virtuous because I’m also serving society and whatnot, but then I thought I probably am biased in my line of thinking. 

I thought of a scenario where a person thinks that not working and not serving society is what nature demands of them due to any hypothetical reason (maybe they think society has failed them and that the right thing to do is to act against it). In that case, doing the opposite of what I thought was virtuous would become the virtuous thing to do for this person.

Is my thought on the right track? Or are there established guidelines for one’s nature to be virtuous? I thought of this after reminding myself of how Diogenes was praised by some stoic philosophers in some aspects (like in the famous banquet analogy).",Stoicism,1702266825.0,t3_18flmnz,0.83,4

Is this stoicism or something else? Vanity?,"Life is suffering. To engage in life's pleasures is to cause more greater suffering later in life. To the contrary, to allow yourself to suffer and deal with the suffering of life in the present, softens the suffering later in life.

Example. People go on vacation and blow thousands of dollars instead of working or investing that money. They buy temporary happiness, but end up slaving for money for more of their life. To the contrary, someone who does not partake in these types of temporary happiness, save money and invest and can become financially free and reduce their suffering later in life by embracing the hard work and discipline it takes to focus on what is important; in this case that is financial freedom.

"Self sufficiency over virtue, initially","I've been revisiting a piece in the Discourses http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0236%3Atext%3Ddisc%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D9,  and I know that ""self sufficiency is the greatest of all wealth"" is Epicurean(I think), and wealth is an indifferent in Stoicism?, but..

""..But a man may say, Whence shall I get bread to eat when I have nothing?""...""Wretch, if you have it, you will have it; if you have it not, you will depart from life...""

Somewhere in that section Epictetus calls some animals irrational and cowardly and then regards them at the same time for being self sufficient and living according to nature. I've heard that the success rate of a hunt for lions in our African wilderness is about 25% and many of them die from starvation. But when they succeed, they roar without reply and ravage without resistance.  I've also heard that tigers are pretty unremorseful. 

""...But we think about ourselves, as if we were only stomachs, and intestines, and shameful parts; we fear, we desire; we flatter those who are able to help us in these matters, and we fear them also...""

""..And shall it be necessary for one among us who is a philosopher to travel into foreign parts, and trust to and rely on others, and not to take care of himself, and shall he be inferior to irrational animals...""

It's coming off alittle like ""do it yourself, do what you have to do to survive..or atleast do what your nature requires in that given context because even actions which appear to be—and indeed are—immoral or unjust advance the overall design, which taken as a whole is harmonious and

Stoicism doesn’t account for the unvirtuous motivations of beneficial behavior,"Many criticisms of stoicism are based upon faulty logic or misunderstandings, but one criticism that has always stuck with me is stoicism seems to underestimate is the heavy influence of unvirtuous motivations to drive positive behaviour.

Stoicism emphasizes the importance of a proper perspective, and valuing virtue above all else. Typically it is seen as unvirtuous to allow your emotions to control you, to allow yourself to stress unnecessarily, or to pursue things like sex, status or ego. 

However, modern psychology indicates these are humanities strongest motivators.  Thus, the closer to a sage you become, the more you eliminate these motivators, and the less productive of a citizen you will become, which ends up defeating a large part of being stoic in the first place. 

You can argue: “To stoics the only thing that matters is you are virtuous.” Would it be virtuous to decline a method which allow you can help fellow man more? Is it not selfish to reject the ability to care more because it harms you more?",Stoicism,1702278563.0,t3_18fos0s,0.36,0

Seneca was highly influential to many Christians scholars to the point someone most likely forged correspondence (an early example of fanfiction) between him and Paul the Apostle.

EVERYTHING that happens is preordained,"I feel anxious. I have to give a presentation tomorrow and I feel anxious. But that's not what worries me. What worries me is the very fact that I am anxious. I have read meditations hundreds of times, I shouldn't feel this way. I should be armed with the thought that nothing in the universe can happen that is bad, because what the universe creates is guided by the laws of logic and cannot be anything but good.

The problem here is with the ""should"". You simultaneously say that the universe cannot give way to something that is bad but at the same time say that what is happening right now is wrong. The universe is wrong, in this case. Everything that the universe has so far created, the big bang, the birth of humanity, the rise of democracy, have been good and without mistake - until today. You being anxious is the universe's first mistake.

Of course this makes no sense. By ""everything that happens is good"" it follows that your anxiety has to be good. If tomorrow you should feel so anxious that you throw up, that is good. A central problem with this line of thinking has to do with expectation. ""I feel like I have done everything right so I shouldn't be feeling this way."" The hardest part, I think, is truly letting go of this expectation. We practice philosophy or spiritualism or religion because we want to be happy but often it is this goal that gets in the way of that happiness. You will still keep practicing, but remember that it is not up to you how things will go or how you will feel. Feeling bad can be a symptom of a problem that you should try to fix but it is not the feeling itself that you should try to fix or even bother with at all.

Edit: This post isn't about the damned presentation. I dont have anxiety about a presentation. I dont even have a presentation. This post was about the possivility of getting to hung up on ""it not working""/""I have read and taken notes on the discourses many times over""/""I have done everything correct"" and getting frustrated over your emotions persisting and your mind continuing to fluctuate. For the record I take full responsibility. I could definitily have phrased this post much better.

On descriptions and prescriptions,"**Introduction**

I’m sure everyone already intuitively knows the difference between prescriptions and descriptions, and can easily explain the difference when asked to. Yet quite often I see people on here struggle to apply this distinction in their Stoic practice.

In this post I will attempt to show this distinction in the context of practicing Stoicism and how one can practice more effectively by keeping it in mind.

**The difference**

The definitions of the words as per the Cambridge dictionary:

Prescription:

>the act of telling someone else what they must have or do.

Description:

>something that tells you what something or someone is like.

In my own understanding, a description is a list of characteristics that is associated with someone or something whereas a prescription is a list of instructions you can follow. We can easily *describe* how it is like for a master musician to play on an instrument, but to *prescribe* the training to attain such skills is a completely different thing.

In the context of training, a description tells you the goal that you wish to attain, and a prescription tells you the process towards  attaining that goal. In the causality chain of events, a description is the consequence and a prescription is an antecedent cause.

What this means is it makes sense to use prescriptions as your practice but not descriptions, and this is really where I see people struggle with.

Consider this simple example. If you sprain an ankle, the description of a “recovered ankle” is “you can run”. Do you then “run” with the sprained ankle so that you match the description of a “recovered ankle”? Of course not, we all have enough common sense to know this is ridiculous. What you do is ""following the doctor’s treatment plan”, or the “prescription”, until “you can run”, at which point you know you have “recovered” because what you can do matches the description. Being able to run is caused by having recovered, which in turn is caused by following the treatment plan.

But “running to recover” is exactly what people are doing when they say something along the lines of “I’m practicing Stoicism by not being disturbed by externals”, or “I’m following the Stoic principle of the cardinal virtues”. Not being disturbed by externals and the virtues are *descriptions* of a practiced Stoic, they are not *prescriptions* for your practice.

Epictetus himself talked about this in the following excerpt:

>But if he has striven merely to attain the state which he finds in his books and works only at that, and has made that the goal of his travels, I bid him go home at once and not neglect his concerns there, since the goal to which he has travelled is nothing; but not so that other goal—to study how a man may rid his life of sorrows and lamentations, and of such cries as ""Woe is me!"" and ""Wretch that I am!"" and of misfortune and failure, and to learn the meaning of death, exile, prison, hemlock; that he may be able to say in prison, ""Dear Crito, if so it pleases the gods, so be it,"" rather than, ""Alas, poor me, an old man, it is for this that I have kept my grey hairs!""

\- The Discourses of Epictetus I.4

I believe this confusion is primarily caused by being introduced to the Meditations as their first Stoic reading material, which brings me to my next point.

**How it applies to the original texts**

As I mentioned just now, I’d bet my money on the Meditations being the primary cause of this confusion. That’s because the Meditations is mostly *descriptive,* there are very few passages in there I can think of that are actually *prescriptive.*

We need to remember, that Marcus had had decades of Stoic training when he wrote it - he was already one of the most well-versed Stoics in human history; and the Meditations was not written to teach others to be like him – it was his private journal. A master guitarist doesn’t need to write down in his journal where to place his fingers on the guitar, he will probably write something like “a 1-minute solo would fit nicely in this segment of this song”.

The Discourses of Epictetus is by far the most *prescriptive* book out of all the remaining original Stoic texts we have. Epictetus is also quite explicit whenever he states his instructions if you read it carefully. Even Marcus himself implied the importance of this book in his Stoic education on the very first page of the Meditations:

>7. From Rusticus: to get an impression of need for reform and treatment of character; not to run off into zeal for rhetoric, writing on speculative themes, discoursing on edifying texts, exhibiting in fanciful colours the ascetic or the philanthropist. To avoid oratory, poetry, and preciosity; not to parade at home in ceremonial costume or to do things of that kind; to write letters in the simple style, like his own from Sinuessa to my mother. To be easily recalled to myself and easily reconciled with those who provoke and offend, as soon as they are willing to meet me. To read books accurately and not be satisfied with superficial thinking about things or agree hurriedly with those who talk round a subject. **To have made the acquaintance of the** ***Discourses*** **of Epictetus, of which he allowed me to share a copy of his own.**

\- The Meditations, book I

There is another anecdotal evidence of this book being a primary education material to the ancient Stoics:

>With these words then the Stoic rid himself of the rich Asiatic. But later, when we were approaching Brundisium and sea and sky were calm, I asked him what the reason for his fear was, which he had refused to reveal to the man who had improperly addressed him. And he quietly and courteously replied: “Since you are desirous of knowing, hear what our forefathers, the founders of the Stoic sect, thought about that brief but inevitable and natural fear, or rather,” said he, “read it, for if you read it, you will be the more ready to believe it and you will remember it better.” **Thereupon before my eyes he drew from his little bag the fifth book of the** ***Discourses*** **of the philosopher Epictetus, which, as arranged by Arrian, undoubtedly agree with the writings of Zeno and Chrysippus.**

\- Aulus Gellius’ The Attic Nights

It should be abundantly clear at this point that the Discourses of Epictetus was amongst the most important Stoic learning materials at the time, and the people back then also had access to the works  of other prominent Stoic figures such as Zeno and Chrysippus. We are fortunate enough to still have access to this book in modern times (albeit half of it is lost), there is simply no reason we shouldn’t follow what the ancients did by using it as our main educational text.

Seneca’s letters and essays are also a decent source of instructional texts. The problem is his love of verbal barrage (he was a famous playwright at the time) means his writings are often very long-winded and in my opinion excessively sophisticated for the purpose of education.

I find his writings more poetic than they are educational, and I often find myself lost in a sort of “trance” when reading his texts, especially his essays. I still struggle to keep track of Seneca’s points when reading his essays to this day.

To me reading Seneca is something I do more for “reading pleasure” for a lack of better words than for learning. Of course that’s just me, if you have a different experience with reading Seneca then by all means do it as part of your learning.

**How we apply it in our Stoic practice**

A marathon runner and a sprinter both share the same goal of being the best at their sport, and thus to train their body to be at its physical peak in the most suitable way for their sport. But the marathon runner is primarily concerned with endurance whereas the sprinter speed. As such their training regimes have to be different.

It is also the case for our Stoic practice. Each of us has a different purpose, a different role to play in the cosmopolis; each of us has a different upbringing, different strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, how we train ourselves in the way of the Stoics must by necessity be different. Again I will quote Epictetus on this same point here:

>I am inclined to pleasure; I will betake myself to the opposite side of the rolling ship, and that beyond measure, so as to train myself. I am inclined to avoid hard work; I will strain and exercise my sense-impressions to this end, so that my aversion from everything of this kind shall cease. For who is the man in training? He is the man who practises not employing his desire, and practises employing his aversion only upon the things that are within the sphere of his moral purpose, yes, and practises particularly in the things that are difficult to master. **And so different men will have to practise particularly to meet different things**.

\- The Discourses of Epictetus III.12

**Conclusion**

In summary, if you wish to make progress in your Stoic training, it is important that you set yourself a description as a goal and devise a prescriptive plan to train yourself towards attaining that goal.

Don’t just start with a far-fetched goal like “I want to be like Marcus Aurelius!”. That’s like watching [a video of Van Halen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULEBSxP725w) and immediately saying “I want to play the guitar like him”, or reading about theoretical Physics for the first time and saying ""I want to win a Nobel prize in Physics!""

Start with something small and managable, something like “I want to stop being a slave to material wealth” if this is one of your weaknesses, then proceed to train yourself to get accustomed to a life with minimal material possessions.

It is also crucial that you are completely honest with yourself about your shortcomings, and be fully committed to follow the plan you devise, in the same vein you have to be completely honest with your doctor about your symptoms and follow her treatment plan if you want to recover most effectively from your illness.

P.S. If this post reads like another “Drop the freaking Meditations and pick up the bloody Discourses of Epictetus”, that’s because it probably is.",Stoicism,1702104495.0,t3_18e7n8l,0.94,29

Life is suffering,"It is my understanding that the Stoics, similar to the Buddhists, advocate accepting that there is a certain amount of suffering in life.  I believe the Buddhists even say that life **IS** suffering.  Instead of waiting and being put off kilter by life's obstacles, the Stoics advocate premeditatio malorum, a kind of meditation on the negativity that might come your way in a given day.

&#x200B;

I don't use that morning meditation every day.  I tend to remember it when things in my life are trending downward; that's when I'm usually grasping at whatever tools I have to make my life better.  I do find it useful.

&#x200B;

More importantly, for me, is the mere acceptance or acknowledgment that my life circumstances are exactly as they must be, warts and all.  I have some influence, but I cannot control them.   Life cannot be without suffering, so I need to accept it as it is. 

&#x200B;

Similarly too, both the Stoics and Buddhist believe that reality itself is neutral, in terms of its significance, but that it's our judgments about the reality that can cause us to suffer.  I am continually having to remind myself of this truth when I go down the rabbit hole of negativity.

&#x200B;

Being more accepting of life's struggles means less suffering  because I'm not constantly craving what isn't.

I'm a novice student of Stoicism and Buddhism, so I would appreciate any comments that clarify or even correct what I'm trying to say.

Being in your late teens and early 20s,"So, we get a very steady stream of posts here along the lines of “I’m 18-25 and I don’t know what to do with my life, don’t understand why I haven’t achieved anything yet, don’t understand why the world seems so bleak and pointless, etc”.

The reason is that you’re 18-25. That period of life is exactly when you question everything, as you come out of childhood and start to work out how to be an adult. This is, in short, a very normal way to feel and a very normal process to go through. 

Don’t be afraid. Let the questions present themselves and allow yourself time to find the answers. Very very VERY few people have things figured out at this stage. Be patient and calm, and allow yourself to be young and still learning. It’s ok not to know what you’re doing yet.

A Brief Gratitude for Stoicism,"I am from a developing country. If people from the developed world can be... well, untrustworthy, politically polarized, immature, horrible and so on, think developed world - economy and institutions and live with that for the rest of your life. I write this on every post in general so I think this has become essentially a part of my internet identity (and not my oh-so-glamorous IRL identity, unless I see discrimination here) 

So when I'm very grateful for Stoicism and the dichotomy of control. I've read and re-read original stoic texts countless times, with pencils and highlighting and all that good stuff. I would not claim I am an expert but if I've almost a decade of experience with 7 Habits of Effective People, I think I already have had a good introduction to Stoicism. Even the ""later"" stoics (big 3) abandoned stoic physics & stoic logic and just concerned themselves with stoic ethics (Discipline of Action) for the most part.

Stoicism as a school did not survive. But oh my god if we did not have the basic ability to focus on what is up to us (or ""control"") and did not have the ancient authors basically contributing to modern psychotherapy and science... I personally don't know how I'd deal with all the pressure and all my personal demons.

So thanks. I'm practically a first generation lawyer and hopefully will work as a District & Sessions judge before retirement. I think I'll never be called ""Justice <name>"" but that's perfectly fine. So, yeah, thank god for the good people behind stoicism and this sub. Even in this sub itself, things get pretty non-stoic and meta... but I think that's to be expected considering we're all humans and imperfect, like Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius and Cicero. 

So thank god for all the Stoic podcasts, authors, translators, and simply fellow students of this philosophy for sharing very good information with me. The first and foremost principle in Stoicism is the principle of Justice (a virtue) and personally I'd have gone crazy with my unorthodox lifestyle and unconventional life story if it weren't for Stoicism and related philosophies.

I have no idea how to handle my breakup.,"We broke up with my partner 2 months ago after 5 years of being together, and my life has been a living hell since then. I lost my job, had to move back in with my parents, I have no friends, everyone in my family is completely unavailable emotionally so I can’t turn to anyone for emotional support and the therapist I’ve been seeing isn’t much help either. (she’s a great person and she’s helped me with other things but I just don’t feel like it helps much with this) Meanwhile she started seeing someone else less than a week after we broke up, and she seems very happy without me in her life. I keep having intrusive thoughts imagining of her enjoying life with her current partner, doing things we used to do together, having sex, etc.

I rediscovered stoicism recently and tried to apply some stoic principles to my situation. I understand that my feelings of jealousy and betrayal come from a misunderstanding of reality. I don’t own or control this person, she is free to do whatever she wants and I should not base my happiness/life on her presence in my life. But I just can’t change how I feel. I also can’t treat this like a learning opportunity, or to become a better person, because I don’t want that. I don’t look forward to anything in life, I just want to escape, I just want it to stop. 

Reason I’m making this post is becaue I have nowhere else to turn and I’m hoping people here may have some advice for me.",Stoicism,1701940113.0,t3_18crodt,0.65,8
Some questions from senecas on shortness of life,"From on shortness of life

""Vices assail and surround us on all sides, and they don’t allow  us to rise again and lift our eyes to the clear discernment of truth;  but they press down on them, keeping them lowered and ﬁ xed on  mere desire. It’s never possible for their victims to return to their  true selves. If by chance they ever ﬁ nd some respite, they still roll  restlessly, just like the deep sea, which still swells even after the wind  has settled; they never ﬁ nd full relaxation from their desires""



Q.1The way he said""It’s never possible for their victims to return to their  true selves""
I felt like it isn't possible even after they quoted the vices




""Look  back and recall when you were ever sure of your purpose; how few  days turned out as you’d intended; when you were ever at your own  disposal; when your face showed its own expression; when your mind  was free from disturbance; what accomplishment you can claim in  such a long life; how many have plundered your existence without  your being aware of what you were losing; how much time has been  lost to groundless anguish, foolish pleasure, greedy desire, the charms  of society; how little is left to you from your own store of time. You’ll  come to realize that you’re dying before your time.”



Q.2 The part ""how few  days turned out as you’d intended""



 I thought he was trying to say how life would be good if he quited slacking, but doesn't this phrase contradict with the others , I understood it as how few days that was like planned, did I miss understand it,

Money/savings and frugality.,"Hi, new to stoicism. I'm learning and it's helping me through a rough time.
Anyway.
I'm not a rich man, but I do save well. I'm very frugal generally and have no want for material things. I prefer to travel.

But right now, I need to upgrade my house, it needs repainted, roof is leaky, it's dated.
Fixing it up is going to eat well into my savings and leave me pretty broke, it makes me feel uncomfortable, that I'm spending it all.

So, what is like to know is how a modern stoic would approach the issue.
Would they just spend it and be done?
Or perhaps just leave the house looking as it is? With exception of roof that needs done.",Stoicism,1701939153.0,t3_18crgxx,0.8,6
"""Each man is as wretched as he has convinced himself he is.""","I've just started reading The Practicing Stoic by Ward Farnsworth.  The full quote of Seneca, in the book, is (p. 39 of the Kindle version) ""'Everything depends on opinion.  Ambition, luxury, greed, all look back to opinion.  it is according to opinion that we suffer.  Each man is as wretched as he has convinced himself he is.  Seneca, Epistles 78. 13.'""  When I first read this Stoic sentiment a couple years ago it was like an epiphany.  What do you mean that my/other's judgments about life and about me are not Truth.  They are just impermanent opinions holding no inherent value or weight.  That I somehow had the power to choose a different interpretation of the so-called facts was a revelation.

Prior to that, and other readings I was doing, I was so unconscious that I was often-times ensnared by my thinking, believing it was my reality (even when objective facts contradicted my thoughts); instead of being aware of the thinker, with the power to change my thoughts, or to not think at all, i.e., meditate or be mindful.

Now I wish I could say that I no longer get ensnared by my thoughts, which in turn can get me down, but at least now I'm more quickly able to intercede and question the runaway thoughts.

Should I forgive no matter what?,"Hello everyone, i’m relatively new to stoicism although I have been looking into stoic views for some time now. I am having trouble trying to decide the best course of action for my own mental and for my sports team regarding forgiveness of a teamate. A player on this sports team that I will call Jake brings down the entire team. Not just in a bad attitude towards the game way but in an instigator with his own teammates way. Jake and I were previously pretty close friends even spending some time together outside of our sport. Until Jake started being such a douche that I called him out for it. If you can’t tell yet, Jake isn’t the type of guy to appreciate being called out in front of his peers. We butted heads for many months but never let it affect us on the field. Recently it had gotten much worse as jake said cruel things to my face, gotten physical with me and my belongings/equipment, and tried to convince teamates I didn’t belong on the team. Now I am a pretty level headed guy, I didn’t let this affect me as I felt sorry for him because he is obviously lacking in some department to have to go after someone like this. What I refused to let happen was my image with others be tampered and for Jake to affect the chemistry of the team where it affects us in game play. During this period I looked at stoicism for guidance and I think I did the right thing. Not once did I raise my voice at Jake, lay my hands on jake, or even talk badly about jake to others. I reasoned that Jake is feeling a certain way and needs to take it out on others. 

Now I will skip some time and get to the part where i need advice. Jake came up to me personally and grabbed my hand shaking it and said “i’m sorry for being such a bad teammate, im working on it” I didn’t say “It’s okay” as being a bad teammate is not okay but i thanked him for his apology. My question is, in stoic principle should I be accepting Jake back into my life as a friend?",Stoicism,1701924045.0,t3_18cnmvp,0.69,5
My criticism of Stoicism,"My criticism has to do with the emphasis that the ancient stoic sages gave to various virtues. Early stoicism was greatly influenced by Socratic piety and its virtue ethics of justice, temperance, courage, and wisdom. Aristotelian ethics also greatly influenced the stoics. Aristotle proposed the following nine virtues: wisdom, prudence, justice, fortitude, courage, liberality, magnificence, magnanimity, and temperance. 

Absent in these virtues and the stoic writings is the virtue of agape. This is a selfless, unconditional love that transcends romantic or familial love. This love is central to Christian theology. The core texts on this love are the sermon on the mount, attributed to Jesus, and the writing of the apostle Paul. 

A parallel to agape or “Christian love” can be found in eastern wisdom traditions as well. In Buddhism, especially the Theravada tradition, they emphasize Metta or the cultivation of boundless, unconditional love and goodwill toward all living beings.

Now the stoics did emphasize benevolence and kindness towards others, but the conception of agape is never a central part of the stoic ethic. I consider myself a novice practicing stoic, and have found that as I continue to learn and grow, my practice of virtue has been improved as I have worked to prioritize the development of agape.",Stoicism,1701914706.0,t3_18ckotn,0.65,5

Is resilience necessary?,"In a conversation here today, the idea of resilience was discussed and it was put to me that resilience is an important thing in Stoicism. I agreed at the time, but on reflection I wonder whether I was wrong. 

The word resilient has always suggested something springy to me, a surface which can be struck and bounce back, like a sapling or a good mattress. In humans, resilience is the ability to weather difficulty and recover from adversity. 

However, the Sage does not experience anything she considers adversity. Winds blow but they do not push her back. Correctly judging all circumstances, she has no need to be resilient because she experiences no suffering. 

Of course none of us are a Sage, but I wonder if resilience is the wrong thing for a student of Stoicism to strive towards. If we are affected enough to need resilience, presumably there is a flaw in our reasoning which needs to be addressed.

Choose not to be harmed—and you won’t feel harmed. Don’t feel harmed—and you haven’t been.,"I like this quote. I come back to it often. I wanted to know if I am applying it correctly after certain situations. 

For example. Every so often I will get into a negative confrontation which leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I tend to obsessive about things in gerneral. Be overly sensitive. Deem everything as a slight at times. I don't want to drone on but someone posted a post something like stoicism is not therapy or substitute for it. And it's not. Not for someone with add who hates to read it definitely won't be. But certain quotes like the one above really can make an impact. Now!! The point. 

Basically I went to a store I do deliveries for they know me. I asked the employee for an additional plastic bag to keep something warm. And he would just not want to do it. Said we can't? I challenged him. He didn't relent. I said I will pay for a freaking 2 cent bag. Still would not do it. Very infuriating, frustrating. Annoying.

Stoicism helps with depression,"
I will never make the claim that Stoicism is a tried and true ""cure"" to depression and/or suicidal ideation. However, I know that the lessons I personally have learned through philosophy as a whole, and Stoicism in particular, have helped me grow a lot in the last few months.

I have my low days still but I have learned how to face those thoughts and feelings from a far more practical view by changing my judgement. Every day I make the choice to allow those thoughts to run rampant or challenge them by seeing them ""for what they are"" as Marcus Aurelius put it. It's not necessarily that Stoicism cured me, it just gave me the tools to confront something I believed was bigger than myself for a long time. 

No amount of psych drugs or therapy can magically ""cure"" a person if they don't change their negative thought patterns and mindset. People who need help **should** seek it, and Stoicism has helped me and many others improve how they handle things.",Stoicism,1701871923.0,t3_18c4t0k,0.92,10

Stoicism is not a replacement for therapy.,"As the title says.

Stoicism is not a replacement for medical intervention. It can replace mental healthy therapy as much as it can replace physical therapy.

It can be an brilliant *companion* to medical intervention as you navigate recovery from any given problem, but it is not a replacement.

Remember, a stoic seeks to understand the world around us. To prioritise knowledge and wisdom above all else. 

There is a wealth of quality, validated research on mental health treatments.

The moment we reject the best established science in favour of *our own interpretation of a philosophy* is the moment we stop being rational, and start treating stoicism as a faith.

This is not just for the very large amount of people coming here seeking stoicism as a replacement for therapy, but directed at the far too many people encouraging using stoicism as a replacement for therapy.

The stoics once believed gravity was that objects are compelled to return to their natural resting point as an innate property of the object itself - A rock belongs on the floor so it is compelled to return there! A good stoic does not go ""No, Newton is wrong... it's not mass attracts mass"", so don't do it for medical science.",Stoicism,1701776416.0,t3_18ba5bk,0.95,515
Stoicism and art?,"Just finished Meditiations for the first time, and I could only find one brief passage about the relationship between Marcus and art. In one passage, can’t remember which one, MA mentioned music, and how if one were to break down a piece into each one of its notes, they could not affect him on their own. From this combined with Marcus telling himself to stop reading books, I infer that he does not believe that art is “good.” While Marcus did ‘cite’ several plays and literary works, this was the only passage I could find in direct relation to it so if someone can find more I would appreciate it.
Here is my core dilemma: I understand that one of the base precepts of stoicism is to not indulge in pleasures. To only seek clarity of the mind and to do the right thing for humanity, as your nature demands of you.

I don’t know her personally, but we have some mutual friends and I’ve seen her at certain events here and there like house parties and such.

She’s so beautiful and pretty and I’ve been infatuated with her ever since I saw her. The problem is, is that she’s completely out of my league.

She’s super popular with many friends and a great social life, comes from a nice supportive family and rich background.

Seneca - is there 20 books comprising letters to lucilius,"Hi 

So I'm reading letters of seneca and I have been fascinated by the legend and I thought of reading further more about him,

And this was the output ! So is there actually each letters from penguin Classics are written in a bigger format as in 20 books? Or am I missing any information? 

Certainly! Seneca's ""Letters to Lucilius"" (Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium) are commonly organized into 20 books. Each ""book"" contains a set of letters, and in total, there are 124 letters. 

Here's a simplified breakdown of the organization:

Books 1-9: These books contain the majority of the letters, with each book consisting of a varying number of letters addressing different philosophical topics and life advice.Books 10-12: These books include letters on various subjects, continuing the themes of earlier books.

Books 13-16: These books are sometimes considered separately as ""On Groundless Fears,"" as they primarily focus on dealing with fears and anxieties.

Books 17-20: These books contain the final set of letters, exploring various Stoic principles and life lessons.",Stoicism,1701881816.0,t3_18c8e29,0.67,1

Stoicism can be a replacement for therapy,"Around my house I can fix things like leaky faucets and dead vacuums, but if a problem brings me close to electrical main lines I call an electrician.

I had my first “sexual” experience at 5, with my two other male cousins. It was the turning point in my life. From then on it has been nothing but a downhill slope from there. I like to be around children and keep them happy and to make sure that nothing harms them. That they can stay their innocent and happy selves, wish someone would’ve had done that with me.

I got older, fatter, yet always knew how to entertain a crowd. From 7-18 it was nothing but yo-yo diets, feeling insecure like any other teenager and simple unrequited crushes.

2. Seeing something triggering memory of wife (Breakup Recently - Don't wanna cry)
3. Speaking about Wife (As above)
4. Not enough table's to set up required event (Work)
5. That during my Mental Health assessment the assessor would think I'm mental and report me
6. The Bus Home from work leaves early (As usual)

My list of What is in my Complete Control preceding my aversions

1. Getting up early enough
2. My own choice to ruminate
3. Not to stalk her social media
4. Speaking honestly about my mental health to the assessor
5. Left it blank here I did 
6. Checking the bus times and live tracking

As Massimo suggests, how can I explicitly tell the story of how the things in my complete control may have led to my aversions?

Thanks for reading and hopefully somebody might be able to shed some light here?

How to properly prepare for a possible prison sentence in a stoic way,"I made some careless mistakes when running my own company a year ago, and my partners backstabbed me by turning me to court

The issues I had trying to apply stoic principles,"This year I started my stoic journey and I've been enjoying it so far. I feel better overall, but the thing I like the most about stoicism is that I have guidance or some sort of ""framework"" on how to behave on any given situation, which facilitates making tough decisions.

One issue I struggled with for some time is knowing what would be ""the stoic way"" to handle certain scenarios I faced in my life. And this was an issue for two reasons:

1. I would have to search for a specific teaching/quote/insight on stoic books that would relate to the situation I'm going through. This is not easy since most stoic books (at least the most popular ones) aren't structured in an organized way. They're mostly just a bunch of teachings with no particular order or association to a specific subject.
2. Once I found some quote or teaching, it was hard to clearly understand the underlying message. I'm kind of new to philosophy, so most times the language used was difficult for me to understand.

So I ended up building an app that would help me with that. I'm not intending to do self-promotion so I wont share any particular details, but I imagine if its helping me now, it can potentially help others.

So I would like to know what people practicing Stoicism think about the concept and what I could do to make it useful to others, so I can share it through the appropriate channels.

It works as follow:

1. You enter some situation you're going through your life. Could be anything, from minor things that happen on your day-to-day to more meaningful situations that affect your overall wellbeing.
2. The app scan through a set of stoic books looking for quotes or teachings that relate to your scenario.
3. Using AI, the app display's the following:
   1. The quote extracted from the books, exactly as it was taken from the source.
   2. The quote explained in plain english. No complex or ancient language, the quote is explained as a friend would explain it to you.
   3. An explanation of how a stoic would handle the situation you're going through. Everything based on the quote mentioned in point no. 1.

# Example

**My scenario:**

*I'm working on expanding my social circle and building meaningful friendships. It's not easy for me to connect with new people and maintain those relationships since I'm very shy*

**The quote taken from books:**

*Judge no speech or action unworthy of you which is consistent with nature. Be not dissuaded by any consequent criticism or censure from others; but, if the speech or action be honourable, judge yourself worthy to say or do it. Those who criticize you have their own conscience and their own motives. These you are not to regard, but follow a straight course, guided by your own nature and the nature of the Universe, both of which point the same way.*

**The quote explained:**

Do not let the opinions or criticisms of others discourage you from pursuing actions that are in line with your own nature and the nature of the Universe. If your intentions are honorable, consider yourself worthy of engaging in those actions or expressing those thoughts. The judgments and motives of others should not influence your decisions, as they have their own perspectives and motivations. Instead, stay true to yourself and follow the path that aligns with your nature and the greater order of the Universe.

**The quote in the context of my scenario:**

In your scenario of expanding your social circle and building meaningful friendships, it is important to remember that you should not let the shyness or potential criticism from others deter you from connecting with new people. The quote emphasizes that you should not judge your own actions or words as unworthy simply because they may be met with criticism or disapproval. Instead, if your intentions are genuine and honorable, you should consider yourself worthy of making the effort to connect with others and build meaningful relationships. The opinions and judgments of others should not hinder your pursuit of social connections, as they have their own perspectives and motivations. Stay true to your own nature and the natural inclination for human connection, and do not let external factors discourage you from taking action.

"Genuinely curious, why should I live if no one can love me","I don’t have a single friend. They all abandoned me for various reasons or they betrayed me. I always was treated like an option or just a background character. Never treated like a *friend*. I’ve never had a boyfriend or a girlfriend before because I am physically unattractive.

I’ve never felt proper love. I’ve been alone, ignored, treated like shit by nearly everyone around me, stranger or not. I can’t make friends, but either way, I don’t really want to because I can’t trust or tolerate anyone anymore after being alone for so long.

I’ve met so many people and befriended them. Only for a temporary time. And I’m still completely alone. My personality is bitter and angry, nothing can change that. My life is truly over and no. Like I said. It’s not going to change. I’ve been like this since I left high school. 

Why should I live? I don’t know anyone else, online or irl in the same situation. Sure, they may not have ever had a parter, but they have friends. Or vice versa. But no one has neither except me.

Core precepts/values and virtues - clarification please,"Bear with me here as I may be using the terms incorrectly.

Is the assumption correct that the virtues Temperance, Wisdom, Courage, Justice aren't core values as such but are what underpin our core values? Therefore the virtues are the foundations that help us with our core values?

Stoicism Vs. Unconditional Forgiveness,"There’s a man named Cliffe Knechtle, a pastor. I came across a video of his which speaks on “forgiveness” and if it has limits. I wanted to make an attempt to respond to how I *think* a practicing stoic would. I would love the insight of others, and the assistance with realigning wherever I may fall short. 

Interviewer: “When does God say “No more, I can’t forgive you for this.”?

Cliff: “I used to work in a prison at Lawrence Massachusetts. Every monday night I would go there, and I first would go into the cell of a man in protective custody who kidnapped little boys, sexually abused him, and murdered him. And after being with him I would go into the basketball gym to play basketball with the other inmates and they would come up to me and say, “Cliffe how can you even talk to such a piece of dirt, don’t you know what he did?” And I say, “Yes I do know what he did, pretty horrendous, pretty grotesque, pretty evil, but he still is a human being created in the image of God, and god offers him forgiveness as horrible as that is. Now there’s a part of me that doesn’t like that, cause I’ve never kidnapped little boys, sexually molested him and murdered him, so I think I’m better. No unfortunately I’m not better, Because in my own sophisticated erudite way I have rebelled against God. I am in desperate need of God’s Grace, his forgiveness, and for me to look down on a guy like that and and say, “Oh, you’re just so inferior, you’re just a piece of dirt” No, he’s a human being created in the image of God, that image has been horribly defaced, horribly, but he still is a human being created in the image of God and God offers him forgiveness.”

- The man in question kidnapped, molested and murdered little boys. This in itself is considered an indifference/external. So, it’s how we use what has happened that is ‘good’ or ‘bad’. ‘Good’ would be to lock this person up or prevent them from doing what they’ve done again in any way possible. ‘Bad’ would be to *not* prevent this person from doing what they’ve done again, in whatever way possible. 

- If we were in a position to choose whether to speak to the criminal, or to…*not* speak to them, the choice is dependent on whether or not doing so would be an act of virtue, with virtue being assigned to what is dependent on our will. If this is the case, then the decision on whether we speak to him or not makes no difference, but how we act within each choice *does* make the difference. If we decided to speak to him, what would be the virtuous way to do so? 

“*You say, “Philosophers talk paradoxes” But are there no paradoxes in the other arts? and what is more paradoxical than to puncture a man’s eye in order that he may see? If anyone said this to a man ignorant of the surgical art, would he not ridicule the speaker? Where is the wonder then if in philosophy also many things which are true appear paradoxical to the inexperienced?*” Epictetus, Discourse 1.25 “On the Same”. 

Based on this quote, I’ve concluded that if I listened to my impression then yes, I would choose not to speak to him because doing so would be bad. However, if my purpose in speaking with the criminal was to learn about why he did it and to prevent it from occurring again, then it would be the right way to act. If I chose to speak to him only to remind him of how shitty of a person is and throw insults at him, this would be *bad* because I am harming my own character by doing this. —— The inexperienced in this case would be the prisoners that question why Cliff even speaks to the man. (?)

-  “*Now there’s a part of me that doesn’t like that, cause I’ve never kidnapped little boys, sexually molested him and murdered him, so I think i’m better. No unfortunately I’m not better, because in my own sophisticated erudite way I have rebelled against God*”. It seems that within Christianity, Rebelling against God = acting without virtue. At least, if our decision to think “I’m better than this guy” leads us to act without virtue, then it is bad. So, am I better than this child, Lester? The truth is: It doesn’t matter. 

- Finally, forgiveness. Would I/Should I forgive? Well, it’s not even my place to forgive. This would be desiring what belongs to others which is a no no. If it WERE my place to forgive (ex. I’m the child that was murdered), whether I forgive or not is…no?

Suppressing emotions,"Hey there,
Am 17 and I am relatively new to stoicism I had lot of trouble while traveling the journey of life,
The problem is that I feel like,I am emotionally weak at times I can't control my anger.whenever I feel angry.I try to control myself but there are times when I have meltdowns whenever I supress my angry for way too long(happens rarely tho).there was this kid from  my class whose bigger than me usually makes fun of me(dudes a bully) most of the time around my classmates,one day we got into an argument and I never were good at arguments,
So I started throwing hands with him and I somehow managed to knock the dude out with a single scratch but even tho I felt sense of happiness after that,later on post realisation hit me like a truck after realising the collatral damage I have created(I accidentally hurt my friends who were trying to seperate us).even tho he was the one who started all of this mess,i apologised to everyone present there.whenever I let my anger control myself I have no memories of the event also I could have accidentally severly injured the guy if I choked him any longer

So I don't want anger to control myself there were many instances similar to this.i always try my best not to cause any trouble and I try my best to avoid being angry at people.but unfortunately I get into fights way often considering how emotionally unstable I am and my mom asked what would happen if I accidentally kill someone if I let my anger control me(as there were similar events just like this)and the question still revolves in my head.

How can one be virtuous if they have a bad moral compass,"Hi all, 

I have been practicing Stoicism for a couple years now but have a question regarding the philosophy which I can’t figure out (probably due to my inexperience/knowledge) The philosophy is more broadly a practical one rather than theoretical one, and encourages people to learn through experience rather than pure study, ‘waste no time arguing what a good man should be. Be one’ 

How does this work if you have an objectively bad moral compass but don’t realise it, I.e. think you are doing the right thing, but are actually causing more harm to people than good, but in your eyes you are practicing stoicism.

How to overcome severe emotional and physical suffering alongside chronic pain,"I (19M) have been through multiple rough patches in my life. To summarize, I struggled with bullying and loneliness as a child. My home country is going through a civil war, and my father has lost all his life savings and our family's wealth and committed suicide after I tried to stop him (but clearly didn't do enough). So, at the mere age of 16, my family fell apart, and we became semi-broke. Add that to the grief of my losing my father and the trauma from the event. This was during COVID-19, so the physical isolation did not really help.

But, throughout all of this, I still managed to succeed in school and gained admission to a top university in the US with a full scholarship. Being the oldest son, I was always the one expected to perform, and I always had a goal of giving back to my mother. During my time at university, I also managed to get a great GPA and pursued multiple internships throughout my summers and during the semesters. I had a carefully crafted plan to reach my goals, and I was determined to succeed despite everything.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Fast forward to the beginning of my most important semester yet, the one where I have to apply for my junior internships and the one where I have to take the hardest yet most important courseload. I started developing pain in my testicles; being the diligent person I am, I saw a specialist the next day of that happening. I got prescribed antibiotics, yet after completing a course of 3 weeks, the pain never went away. But I was determined not to let this pain stop me from pursuing my goals. A month later, after being in constant pain and going to 3 different doctors, I started having pain in my right testicle; this pain was excruciating. I immediately went to the ER, where they conducted imaging and lab tests and concluded nothing was wrong, so I was sent on my way. But the pain never really subsided. After countless ER and specialist visits, I was found to have a blood clot in my right-sided scrotum, which is apparently so rare only 25 cases have been previously documented. I took my meds, but the constant pain never really went away. It seems the condition is ""resolved,"" i.e., they can't find the clots anymore. But here I am left with a constant pain that often turns excruciating over the course of 4 months with no doctor seeming to help and hope of relief in the future.

&#x200B;

I couldn't apply for internships, and my academics suffered greatly to the point where I started failing classes; I am now experiencing severe depression and chronic pain. My body is always tired and fatigued. I can't help but think of my friends and colleagues who are all leading everyday nice lives, and some of whom are succeeding in the way I dreamt and worked so hard to achieve.

I now live alone and practically isolated, away from family, severely depressed, bedridden, and in chronic pain. My life fell apart, and I have lost my dreams and goals.

How would a stoic approach this predicament? How can I train my mindset to continue pushing through these problems?

This lack of autonomy has resulted in a pretty boring life, and zero life outside academics. It gets quite mundane, but my thoughts entertain me. However, a time frequently comes where I have reject my friends' invitations to outings/meetups/malls/college programs, etc and that's when I realize that I have no liberty in my life, causing emotional pain and pity like no other. Its been years now, I believe I should be used to it.

There's isn't much I can do about it either, I have tried reasoning things out multiple time and it doesn't end well. I can only move out at 24-25 (Our culture doesn't allow moving out either but I have a plan figured out). Logically it is easy to convince myself that I can't do much about it but it doesn't ease the emotional pain, specially when I have relive this while explaining to situations to friends, or think of the memories I could have made.

The only thing I end up doing is distracting myself from pain by social media or video games. I see no other way out.

Accept or Adverse,"Too often do I hear and read from so called professionals, gurus, mentors, authors, priests, etc 
That Stoicism is too passive of a practice and relies to heavy on determinism and apathy therefore having no effect on the conscience mind that is constantly trying to progress. For reference, Iv read E, S, and MA more times than I can count and continue to read them daily alongside my Bible. This is my path as a Prokopton.  What really grinds my gears is for the high level articles and pundits to give the observation that we are to accept all that happens to us. Blasphemy! I see it here in this Reddit group more than I can count and I hope this post will serve as my response in future discourses. 


“The true man is revealed in difficult times. So when trouble comes, think of yourself as a wrestler whom God, like a trainer, has paired with a tough young buck. For what purpose? To turn you into Olympic-class material.” Epictetus

“What would have become of Hercules, do you think, if there had been no lion, hydra, stag or boar – and no savage criminals to rid the world of? What would he have done in the absence of such challenges? Obviously he would have just rolled over in bed and gone back to sleep. So by snoring his life away in luxury and comfort he never would have developed into the mighty Hercules.” Epictetus

What I’m saying is, giving the response of “it’s not in my control” isn’t an all encompassing response to difficulty. The message that so many miss. Mainly the dichotomy of control isn’t just about recognizing what is external or internal so you can disregard uncontrollable events, it’s about recognizing what you can/need to take action on.

Been experiencing anger issues lately.,"I moved here in Romania recently and today has marked 2 months since my arrival, I started a ""new life"" as some may say, with a better job and out of the ghetto, I came here to take care of my grandma because she raised me and I want to honor my grandfather who died this year, a true orthodox family man. 

But I made a lot of sacrifices to come here, I was used to having dozens of friends, now I have like two, my girlfriend of one year and a half broke up with me because I decided to go and take care of my family and a long distance was ""too much"" for her despite me being willing to make a 1100km trip just to see her every month. 

And apparently this, plus the job I work which is indeed pretty easy but is a hard to master skill, have made me notice I've been becoming way angrier than I was. 

I have my father's explosive anger and my mother's vengefulness, which may indeed be assets at times but the explosive part is making me want to punch the shit out of anything that doesn't work within 2 seconds. 

I already go to the gym..i think i will start boxing since im interested in it and punching is literally my immediate reflex to anything nowadays for some reason. 

But I'd want also a more in depth opinion of the Stoics of how I could handle this. 

I've also been told at work that I look very angry, and obviously i do when i don't hit the targets needed immediately even tho I've been told I'm very good for my first month I am still quite competitive.

"Logos, the mind, and change","**TLDR**:

If you're dissatisfied with your circumstances and you want to change your dissatisfaction, you have to change either your reasoning process to change your judgements about your circumstances, the circumstances themselves, or a combination of both. The rest of the title is only ~~for the nerds~~ a click-bait.

**Full post**:

I’ve noticed a common pattern in advice posts where the posters ask how to be content about a situation in life they’re obviously dissatisfied with, yet they insist on changing neither their desire nor their situation. Typically they mention doing Stoic “practices” such as “acceptance of fate”, “negative visualisation”, “dichotomy of control”, etc.

In this post I will try to explain why none of these “practices” by themselves have any causal effects on contentment by relating to the concept of Logos and the Stoic theory of the mind.

***Logos***

Logos is defined as “the rational principle governing the universe” ([source](https://iep.utm.edu/stoicism/#SH2b)). The word “rational” here means explainable, consistent, causal, and deterministic. In other words the opposite of true random chance. Note that the ancients didn’t come up with the abstract concept “rational” and looked for things existing in the universe that they could apply this concept on. It’s the other way around – they observed that things existing in the universe follow a causal pattern and they described the phenomenon as “rational”.

This “rational” characteristic of the universe is what allows us to thrive using our “rational” mind. We are the only animal species that’s capable of comprehending this “rationality” permeating throughout the universe and using it to our advantage.

It might be difficult to wrap your head around this concept because it’s the only observable universe    we have access to. To understand what an “irrational” universe would be like, consider these thought experiments:

* What if gravity switches between pulling and pushing completely randomly?
* What if fire switches between generating and absorbing heat completely randomly?
* What if the Earth changes its shape between sphere, cubicle, pyramid, flat, cylinder, etc completely randomly?

When you consider these possibilities you will see how impossible it is for us humans the way we are now to live in such a universe.

Personally I prefer to understand Logos as a combination of mathematical rules (as opposed to linguistic rules) and natural laws (as opposed to man-made laws).

***The*** ***mind***

The ancient Stoics believed that the mind was purely physical ([source](https://iep.utm.edu/stoicmind/#SH2a)). Scholars haven't reached an agreement on whether this means strictly what we now call “[materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism)” or something else entirely. Regardless of what this belief should be called, they agree the Stoics believed the mind is a thing that is made up of physical materials and thus follows the physical laws of the universe.

What this means is the mind isn’t only capable of comprehending the “rationality” of the universe, it operates based on the same “rational” principle itself. The short version of the Stoic theory of mind in relation to this principle is as follow:

* We perceive external stimuli in the form of perceptions.
* We combine these perceptions with our existing beliefs (which by themselves are formed through the same “rational” principle) to form judgements (or also called impressions).
* Our emotions are a result of these judgements. Some think emotions are how the mind perceive the judgements (or how the judgements “feel”), some think they are caused by the judgements, some others think they are side-effects (or by-products) of judgements. In any case there is an inseparable link between our judgements and emotions.

There is much more to the Stoic theory of the mind but for the purpose of this post this short description will suffice. The important lesson we want to take from this is that our judgements and emotions are caused by the application of our reasoning process when combining our perceptions of reality with our existing beliefs.

***Change***

With the knowledge of how the mind works in Stoicism, the question that follows is how do we change our emotions? Given that emotions are caused by 2 factors (or variables): our beliefs and the facts about reality (our circumstances), it logically follows that our emotions will change if and only if there are changes in those factors.

As a software engineer, when I learned about the Stoic theory of mind I immediately related it to how I have always approached my software. The software is programmed in a certain way (my beliefs), this programming reflects my understanding of the business requirements, the programming operates on fundamental mathematics and logic (Logos). Given a set of input (circumstances) the software always produces the same set of output (emotions). If the output doesn’t match my expectation (a bug in software engineering terms), then I will proceed to think about whether I should change my input or my programming, or both (sometimes I also change business requirements, but that also falls under changing my ""beliefs"").

If you can’t relate to my software analogy, try to think of it like a mathematical function f(x) = y, where:

* f denotes a transformation function which contains formulas (beliefs), which adhere to mathematical laws (logos) such as commutative, associative, distributive, and so on.
* x is a variable (circumstances).
* y is the result of transforming x with the function f (emotions).

This means if you want a different result, let’s call y’, you have to change either the input to x’, or the function to f’, or again both.

If it’s still hard to relate, let’s try another analogy. Suppose you want to get inside a room behind a closed door. You turn the knob clockwise. You pull it inwards and it doesn’t open. At this point you can try one of the followings if you still want to get inside the room:

* Turn the knob anti-clockwise.
* Push the door outwards.
* Assert if it’s possible that the door is locked from the inside, if so:
   * Is there a keyhole, and if so where is the key?
   * Is there an alternative way to get inside the room without going through that door (is there a side entrance, a window with which you can climb into the room, and so on)?
* ~~Kick it open.~~

In summary, the point I’m trying to make with this post is that if you feel a certain way about something and you want to change how you feel, then you have to change something that directly contributes to how you feel about it, be it your beliefs or the thing itself. If you change neither and insist on seeing a change in how you feel, you will certainly fail because you will be trying to fight against the laws of the universe. It will be like repeatedly hitting the switch of a broken light bulb hoping that eventually it will light up.",Stoicism,1701595664.0,t3_189q0lt,0.87,25

How to reconcile this?,"Stoicism says you can only control your internals like your own thoughts, actions & reactions.

But are we truly in control of our thoughts & actions? Our actions at any given moment are influenced by so many factors like our general upbringing, our traumas, desires, aversions, our surrounding environment, our biological disposition  & many more and most of these factors are beyond our control. 

Same goes for our thoughts.

Then how am I really in control of my thoughts and actions?

Even me stumbling upon ideas of stoicism wasn't in my control. One day Youtube decided to recommend me a video of stoicism and that point I was in a mood to watch a self help video.

So at best Stoicism can be an emotion management tool which requires many perceptual adjustments to really internalize it in one's life.

Struggling with sexual desire and buying sex,"Although sex is a normal thing, as a single virgin 28M am struggling with it. Ideal solution would be to have a stable relationship with someone, and i can do it if i pursue. But i come from a conservative background where my parents won't accept it. I have been seeing a few woman online chat/call upon their recommendation, but i live in abroad (in a more liberal society), so the communication gap with the other people matters a lot. I have been away from my family over 5 years. I do need physical affection and love and hug in this single life (friends are not enough). I don't see myself getting married soon, and i have been seriously considering buying instead of wasting my 20s youth time just like that. Can’t deny that this sex drive may have affected my work.

(2) I could probably earn more
(3) I feel like I will never be promoted at this company, as my application was rejected twice already in the past two years.

Is stoicism working for you?,"Don't know when you guys realized that stoicism is really helping you, but for me it clicked when I realized a few years ago that I was no longer overly afraid to die. 

&#x200B;

I used to struggle with the idea that I was sick with something, any tiny symptom that I had I would think I had some sort of bad cancer. Practicing negative visualization in the beginning helped me big time with that, only 10 minutes every morning, but making it a routine. It helped me understand that during the day when any negative thought came I didn't need to think about, I could simply talk myself into waiting for tomorrow's session. I realized I was becoming a much less anxious person, to the point now that I have to, for example, to do the opposite and force myself to go to the doctor to have some regular checkups, otherwise I won't even bother.

&#x200B;

It's still not perfect though, I still struggle at work, for example, to keep it cool when I'm confronted with something, when my boss does something I don't like... I still let this kind of stuff get to me. Even though it is a little better, I still see this as a big area of improvement. I can't for example receive an email that triggers some reaction on me, put it on my to do list, and carry on with the next task. I keep thinking about it until I reply it, and sometimes my answer is not the greatest as I'm still emotional when I reply to it.

&#x200B;

Obviously I know I will never be a sage, there are some areas where you excel, others that you find more difficult, but after 5 years practicing stoicism, I can say that it really helps me big time, and it completely changed my life for the best. It gave me tools to deal with frustrations and difficulties, and I'm grateful even for the simple fact that it made me think about how I behave, ways I could improve myself to make my life and my loved ones better.

"""In the void is Virtue, and no evil""_Miyamoto Musashi","I've long felt that there were alot of similarities between Miyamoto Musashi's Infinite Success and Marcus Aurelius' Meditations. Maybe it's because of ""take up the attitude of the sun"" and ""to watch the courses of the stars as if you revolved with them"". Lines that standout for me in both books and to me appear to be talking about the exact same thing in the exact same way. Musashi while talking about the void in that book says ""..it is where there is nothing...it is not contained in man's knowledge."" I guess i feel like the body of knowledge of Stoicism is incomplete (I wouldn't know, I haven't read every Stoic text ever written)because of the absence of sages among us everyday. But someone wrote a comment on  here sometime that made me think Stoic Sages are all around us, but we would never know they are here because they are doing their job well.(Like the Oracle when she tells Neo, that there are programs running all over the place, programs to control the sun, the wind, and that the one's doing what they were meant to do, we would never know they are were here). To get to the void Musashi writes that ""..polish the two fold spirit heart and mind"", for which Stoicism as I've come to know it is the best substance for that. And to ""..sharpen the twofold gaze perception and sight"", which to me means understanding the origin of my mother tongue(Luganda).

Does Stoicism Accept Suicide?,"Julius Caesar ended him. George Washington wanted to be like him.

Cato The Younger, the most Stoic of the Stoics, decided to die instead of living under a dictator.

But was his death against Stoicism's main idea?

Cato, when he realized Julius Caesar was going to win the war and become the sole ruler of Rome, went to his room.

There, with the noises of fighting men and death clouding his ears, he sat down to read some Plato.

Soon after, the time had come.

Cato took his sword and stabbed himself in the stomach deep enough to feel it, but not deep enough to kill him.

When his son and some of his soldiers entered the room, they found Cato hurt and bloody but not dead.

So they did what any good son and ally would do: they tried to save him.

But then, Cato did the unthinkable.

He was so committed to his cause, or so blinded and confused (I'll get to that in a second), that he disemboweled himself.

In plain English, Cato used his hands to take out his own guts and ensure certain death.

Not only is this a horrific way to die, but it also raises big questions.

Sure, I'm with Cato: this needs balls. To stand against a dictator and show your opposition with works, not words.

But why doesn't anyone comment on the fact that Cato went against Stoicism's most important idea: The Dichotomy of Control?

The fact that Julius Caesar was going (he didn't) to become Rome's ruler was out of Cato's or anyone's control.

Shouldn't Cato, as a Stoic, have accepted this course of events and done the best with what was given to him?

Of course, this brings new questions:

1. What if Caesar killed him? From historical references, Cato and Caesar did no hate each other. But I get that Cato would prefer to die out of his own hands.
2. The Stoics, and Cato as well, viewed life and death as indifferent. So they were fine with one ending one's life, only if the situation demanded it (sacrifice for the common good) or if their life was unbearable.

Detachment vs effort,"I'm making my way though Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus and reading a lot about the detachment from things we can't control. To me it sounds really similar to themes in Christianity and Buddhism and I really appreciate it and think this is a great way to live through adversity.

My quandary and the issue I have in applying it to my life has to do with the disconnect between detachment and creative effort. Despite being content with anything, stoics, I assume, still strive for things other than contentment? There is an imperative to ""live in accordance with nature/reason/God."" There is (even though the texts don't talk about it frequently) positive things we ought to do? Say I'm a husband and father (I am). Isn't it in keeping with stoicism that I provide for my family? Let's say I'm struggling to do that. I think the common stoic advice is to focus on the effort that I apply in this regard and accept that ultimately success is outside of my control. The idea is that I control my actions and not my situation.

The problem with that is it's only true in philosophy world. You absolutely DO have control over your success even if that control is partial and success can't be guaranteed. We are intelligent creatures and opportunities for creative solutions to our problems abound. The world is full of stories of people who thought their way out of difficult situations. Ok, but the stoics do say you can make the attempt so what's the issue? 

The issue is that trying to try isn't trying. One can only fully engage in difficult creative problem solving if they believe that the solution is within their control and they are attached to the outcome. No Olympic winner was just trying to try his best. They were trying to win. The investment in the outcome is necessary for the effort. I know from personal experience how much less likely I am to solve a technical problem I encounter if I think it might not have a solution. This is the opposite of the stoic advice which emphasizes acceptance of fate.

However, I still have a bit of a bone to pick with this attitude, as to my eyes it makes light of and minimizes the value of personal connections. If I am not attached to my brother or my child and they die, and I am not shaken or disturbed by their loss due to my lack of attachment, then did I truly love them? To me it seems like the pain of losing a loved one (whether to death, distance, a breakup, etc.) is not a bug or a problem of being too attached or possessive, but rather a simple proof of your love and value they had in your life. 

In short, if you aren't devastated at the loss of your child, did you really love them as a parent should love their child? If you lose something you value and it doesn't hurt, did you really value the thing you lost?",Stoicism,1701446105.0,t3_188f88g,0.93,13
What does this passage in medditations mean?,"""Judge yourself entitled to any word or action which is in accord with nature, and do not let an subsequent criticism or persecution from anyone talk you out of it. No, if it was a good thing to do or say, do not revoke your entitlement. Those others are guided by their own minds and pursue their own impulses. Do not be distracted by any of this, but continue straight ahead following your own nature and universal nature: these two have one and the same path""

Ended this workweek on a bad note - need advice on how to approach,"I have a quite demanding job which requires a certain degree of attention to detail and to be able to perform under pressure. I, unfortunetaly, have a less than desirable memory and periodically problems with my concentration; this leads sometimes to sloppy mistakes. I do however my best to avoid this and correct any mistakes I make. 

I have had a good workweek so far, having flow. However, this friday was quite hectic as I had many important reports and documents to write and submit. I was meant to wait for greenlight from my colleague on one report, this I unfortunetaly forgot completely and ran it anyway. The consequences weren't major, as it could be fixed after. It's just embarrassing, because they were annoyed by this mistake and pointed it out in a tartly phrased email. 

I have tried to look it at like this: we all make mistakes, it's all about how we handle them and try to avoid them in future. Is this the correct approach? I'm questioning my entire value as an employee and feel as if I'm just not cut out for a position like this. ",Stoicism,1701450961.0,t3_188h4gx,0.87,6

Guilt over having a nice job,"This may sound stupid to some of you but I am genuinely needing some advice. I have a nice job, decent salary and the best part is it’s wfh. I get the work done on my own pace and take frequent breaks. I see so many people waking up at the crack of dawn to go to their very exhausting job. It makes me feel very guilty. I feel like I don’t deserve the things that I have when there are so many people that work so hard. My dilemma isn’t so much so the money I have, it’s more the comfort I get to experience and while others can’t.

What difference does it make about the rationality of the universe?,"The ""The Practicing Stoic"", in Chapter 11, by Ward Farnsworth says:

My question is that what difference does it make if nature is rational and providential? How does that add to the argument that nature commands us to live in obedience to reason and designed us to gravitate towards virtue? This question stems from the fact that even if our nature is to be rational, the question still remains: why should we live in accordance with nature?

Advice On Moving Out and Possibly Coming Out to Religious Family,"Hi there, I'm a 21 Y.O. male from the UK, and would like some advice when it comes to moving out from my family home and living independently.

I'm in a bit of a tough situation, as my parents and family are aware of my apathetic attitude towards Islam. They know that they'll have to continually force me to wake up for morning prayer, they know that most of my friends are non-Muslim and they know that me moving out could only mean that I'm looking to distance myself from them and the religion.

I know many others who've managed to gain independence once they've moved out for university, but since I've been working from home ever since I left high-school at 18, I've never been able to use the excuse that I'm looking to move out for work related reasons. They'll only accept me moving out once I've found a wife.

This is why I feel forced to come out to them and tell them that I'm no longer a Muslim, for the sake of my own sanity. I'm not sure what the best approach is when it comes to telling them I'm moving out, or that I'm no longer a practicing Muslim. I've accepted that my family would most likely disown me, but I find it hard not to feel responsible for the pain that I'm causing them.   


What is my duty to them as a son? And how should I navigate this situation?

Today marks 3 years since my mother's passing. Just looking for any good advice on grief and how to process it.,"I'm rather new to stoicism and been trying to learn as much as possible to get me out of this mental rut I've been in for a while now. Some days are better than others but this month has been hard as my mothers birthday is at the beginning of the month and then this is also the time that she caught covid and went through that battle before passing a few weeks later. It was such a rough time in my life. 

I know I still have a lot of stuff that I need to work through with it, years later and I still don't think I've really processed any of it. Just seeing the word ""Mom"" makes me want to shut down. I try not to let my grief get the better of me, I feel bad being so depressed and down on days like her birthday or during the holidays that she loved where I feel like I should be celebrating her life instead of sulking. Its just so hard to not feel crushed when I think about it all.

Stoicism and mental health.,"I wasn't sure of which tag to use so forgive me there. 

Im not clear on how to articulate my thoughts on this subject: I check this sub from time to time and what i find are in a lot of cases are questions that should be a simple answer: seek professional help. 

Correct me if im wrong but stoicism is a way to think about the world and your place in it. What it is not is a  sound system for dealing with the complex emotions of depression, thoughts of suicide or any other extreme mental health issues. 

My belief has always been that the people who struggle with stoic behaviors and or beliefs are not fit for stoicism. Again correct me if im wrong. 

Im rambling a bit but this was on my mind so i figured id share and open up for discussion.

the thoughts are winning this week and I feel like I wanna disappear just to see how others will react,"I've struggled with depression and loneliness for years, it comes and goes in waves.

This past week its all coming back full force. The morning car ride to work is filled with these ""what ifs,"" the car ride home is the same, and I spend half my night just fantasizing about how others will react, if they even care, or even what I would write on a note and who I would mention kinda thing. Who I would thank, who I would ignore...

I dont really plan on doing it, but I cant help but fantasize about it.

The very worst part is that I have a bunch of people that seem to truly really care about me. I dont feel it much from my parents or brother, they're a very ""buh tough love"" type bullshit, but I feel it from my friends and even coworkers. Kinda sad that I feel closer and more accepted and cared for from my coworkers than my own family but it is what it is.

I have friends that reach out and invite me to things, I know they'd care. There are a few coworkers that would care.

But I keep having these doubts and insecurities about it. I always seek reassurance and even when I get it I still have trouble accepting it.

I always overthink things and come to the worst conclusions first. Literally like 95% of my overthinking's have been wrong. I see something and immediately think these people are ghosting me or talking shit or lying to me or whatever and then later I find out the truth and it really was something completely innocent and unrelated to me.

Its always the same pattern but I cant ever trust or accept that everything's fine.

I ALWAYS seek out the worst in situations even though it pretty much never happens. Like I said, just about 95% of my insecure overthinking is wrong, but every time I get a inkling of doubt I come to the shittiest conclusion and stress myself out.",Stoicism,1701337607.0,t3_187ewam,0.92,32

I'm supposed to protect him from the dangers of this world but I can't even protect him from my fucking self. I don't mean to hurt him in any way possible but it seems like I keep unintentionally damaging him. I don't know what to do. Just an hour ago i was attempting to get him off my bed so that he can go to his as it's night time and I didn't want him to get scolded(he has a tendency to take forever to get on the bed) and I thought he got his footing when I lifted him up but he didn't. He fell backwards in a kneeling type position and then he fell back and hit his head hard. The sound was fucking horrifying. As he hit his head he cried Mama! Mama! Man that was fucking hard to listen to man 😢. Then he started crying and I held him up. He held his head as he was crying and I don't know what to fucking do man, i feel so fucking guilty. He's okay now and is on his bed but there's this huge bump that hurts on his head and I just can't keep myself together when i think about it. Not the first time he's hit his head because of me and i didn't mean to. I never mean to and yet he still gets fucking hurt. I've never had thoughts about ending my life and I never will but i just think i might. Thank God 🙏 he was seen to by my mom and is okay now but I don't know, i don't know what to do.


Hey guys I appreciate the comments. The reason why I needed to get it out was because it's not the first time I accidentally hurt him when I had no intention to. It sucks knowing that i could possibly hurt him when trying to help him and when i do remember i try to be mindful but I'm a fairly forgetful person so it doesn't always register.

Is the heroic masculine purpose equivalent to the pursuit of Stoic moral virtue?,"I just watched this video below and I cannot not see that there is a connection between the heroic masculine purpose themed in this deconstruction and the desire to live by Stoic virtues. Is there a connection? Are they the same thing? Is the heroic masculine purpose a real thing, and if so is there a place for it in Stoicism?

Part of the draw of Stoicism for me is, the desire to live a virtuous life. It oozes purpose. And to see that it permeates the idea of the masculine hero  in our popular culture shows that stoicism is mainstream yet undefined as such or masquerading as a hero's journey.

I never hold grudges. Am I a pushover or am I just being wise?,"Since I was very young, I’ve always resonated with the quote “Holding Onto Anger Is Like Drinking Poison and Expecting the Other Person to Die”

I sometimes temporarily get really sad or heartbroken or disappointed. But I rarely get too angry. Whenever someone does me wrong, I always try to see things from their perspective. 

I have zero malice or anger towards any ex lovers or ex friends. Often, I’ll even still have a little love for them. Some of them, if they have really betrayed my trust and try to get back into my life, I will say no because I don’t want to feel the pain of getting hurt again. That’s only if I feel like they are untrustworthy but not because I feel anger or resentment towards them. But it takes alot for me to even feel this. 

I worry that sometimes I am too forgiving and I wonder if I am just being too complacent and not able to think to see my worth by being too empathetic. 

So back to my question - am I just being a pushover or am I taking a mature stance on situations like this?

Also I am reminded by this quote by Epictetus, “Any person capable of angering you becomes your master; he can anger you only when you permit yourself to be disturbed by him.”

What should i keep in mind during these hard times?,"Im a 17 year old boy and im facing the lowest point of my life so far. 

I want to survive this painfully subjective pain but for context, it all started when my girlfriend of 18 months cheated off on me and treated me in a way such that even my counselor thinks that i’m emotionally abused. After all of those, my mind wouldn’t align with my emotions. I know i deserve better (probably attachment issues) but i still long for her.Fast forward, my parents went through divorce— my mom cheating on my stepfather. It felt painful as well as it somehow a cause of my relapse from the break up i had with my cheater gf.

Yesterday I used the stoic advice for the first time efficiently after losing my wallet.,"So I took a bus home yesterday.

I left my wallet on the seat next to me. 

I was reading something on my phone about atomic bombs and I was very interested about it, so I didn’t do the lifesaver check I normally do on the area I’ve been before leave, so when I got home, where’s my wallet?

Back from work, tired, hungry, I started feeling like the rage and anger were increasing within myself.


“feck, it is not anywhere, I’m quite sure I forgot it on the bus, FECK, There’s always something new isn’t there? OF COURSE, how amazing of me, F*CK, I didn’t pay attention NOW I’m paying for this” 

All this dialogue going on in my head while I was brutally in a way throwing my blankets far away in the hopes I’d still find it somewhere in my room.

I was hungry but then I wasn’t anymore, like, how can I enjoy a fecking meal now?

At some stage I gave up, I froze my credit cards through the apps.

All of a sudden, however, this realization strikes me:

WAIT, I can’t control what happened, but I can control how I’m going to express my emotions after acknowledging whatever is happening on the surface.

So, magically I could gradually calm myself down, and for the first time I could actually use the stoic advice.

We only know if we really absorbed the philosophies when we face hard times.

Suddenly I was able to adopt a stoic posture in relation to what happened.

I thought logically that it wouldn’t be worth to ruminate about the whole “what-is-the-outcome”. 
Instead, I faced the possible reality of the facts and accepted it.

“I’ll call the bus station tomorrow, if they didn’t find anything, I’ll do all my documents once again, and that is it” 

I was filled with calmness once again.
I ate some food and the thought that would before become some kind of obsessive thinking barely went through my mind last night.

It was also interesting to see from time to time my mind trying to function in the “old” way. 
So I was reading something on my laptop and my mind randomly goes “My wallet, bro I lost my wallet, F*ck” and seconds later I’d also hear the thoughts “saying” “haven’t we talked about this already?” The end.

I lost things before because I used to be very forgetful.
This kind triggers something in me.
But THIS time it felt like I was in control after a LONGGG time.

It felt like there was a catalogue of emotions, and I picked one that made me feel “You don’t control what happened, but you control how you respond to it”


Ps: btw, I’ve called them and they have my wallet at the bus station. Yayy",Stoicism,1706262291.0,t3_1abepd9,0.9,25

Only time can heal what reason cannot.,"Many a times, we would have come across this situation. We know that worrying about it is fruitless for there is nothing to be done. What I've noticed if we persevere through the emotions, we forget what it is we worried about. I love how fate is fate. I love how stoicism tells us to let it be. Things run it's course.

Maintaining Confidence in One's Beliefs and Opinions Despite Disagreement from the Majority,"There were a couple of [studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments) done in the 1950s that looked at the influence of other people's opinions/beliefs on an individual's perception. These studies had a group of people view series of lines and determine which was the longest in each case. However, only one member of the group was actually a participant; the rest were actors. While the actors chose the correct lines in the beginning, over time they began, as a group, to select obviously incorrect lines as the longest. This had a marked influence on what the participant chose, and, despite many times having misgivings about the answer, ended up conforming in most cases.

I've noticed in my life that there are numerous opinions that I'm well read upon that most people disagree with reflexively. My opinions are controversial and I'm sure most of you here would disagree with me as well. However, I'm a logical individual and I try to learn about the reasoning of the disagreements through discussion and debate. Often times, however, I'm told I'm a bad person for having my beliefs, but I've not heard very substantive reasons that I'm mistaken: they're mostly value-based. I remain unconvinced.

At the same time, however, I can't help but always have doubt in my heart because so many people disagree with me. In fact, the more often, I hear I'm wrong, I'm more and more affected, even without a logical reason.

Rudyard Kipling says regarding being a man, ""If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, But make allowance for their doubting too"". I believe this fully. As a stoic, how does one balance trusting in his or her own beliefs while taking into account the input of others, even when they view you as a bad person for those beliefs?",Stoicism,1706272408.0,t3_1abhayh,0.71,4

Some things you may not know about Marcus Aurelius,"I was talking today to Brian Muraresku, author of the *Immortality Key*, about Marcus Aurelius and the Eleusinian mysteries and it occurred to me that it might be worth sharing a few bits of trivia that I've learned over the years while researching my (three!) books on Marcus' life and times, especially my biography, [Marcus Aurelius: The Stoic Emperor](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300256666/marcus-aurelius/).  None of this is earth-shattering but I think they're things most people haven't heard about, which help make Marcus a more three-dimensional character, and for many people, like myself, being able to visualize the author can help them get more out of reading the *Meditations*.

1. There is a bust of Marcus Aurelius that survives today in the grounds of the temple complex at Elefsina, just outside Athens, where it once adorned the pediment of the *propylaea* or main gate leading into the temple of Demeter, used for the famous Eleusinian Mysteries.  It seems to be circled with poppy flowers, a symbol of Demeter.  We know Marcus went here around 176 CE to be initiated and presumably drank the famous kykeon, which Brian believes contained *ergot*, a hallucinogenic drug.  Marcus became a patron of Eleusis, paying to rebuild the temple after it was sacked during the First Marcomannic War, by Sarmatian raiders.
2. Some people believe we know nothing about Marcus' life when in fact we know far more about him than we do about almost any other ancient philosopher, because he was a famous emperor.  We have the *Meditations*, of course, but also three Roman histories of his reign: Cassius Dio's *Historia Romana*, the *Historia Augusta*, and Herodian's *History of the Empire from the Death of Marcus*.  There are also many fragmentary references to Marcus in other surviving texts.   
 But we also have numismatic evidence (from coins and medallions), statues, inscriptions, and other archeological evidence.  Some of you may know we have a cache of private letters between Marcus and his rhetoric tutor, Marcus Cornelius Fronto, discovered in the 19th century.    Perhaps the least well-known source of information exists in the Roman legal digests, which contain hundreds of references to Marcus' legislative activity, and which some scholars have used to try to reconstruct a picture of his political agenda.
3. In Carnuntum, in Austria, there's a huge archeological park, with an entire working reconstruction of a 2nd century Roman villa, and many ruins from around the time of Marcus Aurelius, as well as three museums.  Marcus famously mentions being stationed at the legionary fortress here, on the banks of the Danube, when he was writing the *Meditations*.  If you ever get a chance - go there!  It's an amazing location, just outside Vienna.
4. I had a chance to [interview the director of archeology](https://youtu.be/qALCMTLND0g?si=e0e_4DcyqXVTlmP4) at the park and ask him if they had discovered anything that could shed light on Marcus' life.  It's often difficult to tie in archeological finds with textual evidence - when you do that's kind of gold dust for historians!  However, they found the funeral stele at Carnuntum of a Praetorian which is dated 171 CE.  The Praetorians are the emperor's personal cohort of guards so it strongly suggests that Marcus would have been there at that point in time, which confirms the date historians have inferred from textual evidence.  He was probably writing the *Meditations* at Carnuntum in 171 CE.
5. We say Marcus became emperor in 161 CE because that's when he was given the title augustus but at this time the office of emperor doesn't really correspond with our English word, e.g., it's composed of several titles and powers, some of which can be shared, whereas others cannot, and which can be assumed at different times.  Marcus was actually granted most of the imperial powers in 147 CE, after the birth of his first child.  So for over 13 years, Marcus ruled alongside Emperor Antoninus Pius, as Caesar, imperator, husband of an Augusta, and wielding the tribunician power in the Senate.  They were notoriously only ever apart for a few days.  I would say Marcus was a *de facto* or virtual (albeit junior) co-emperor, alongside Antoninus, for many years before we normally think of him assuming power. 

If anyone is interested, maybe we could do another AMA or something in this Subreddit talking about research on Marcus Aurelius' life. ",Stoicism,1706216625.0,t3_19fjtcd,0.95,68
How to Deal With a Mothers Concerns,"Hey fellow Stoics,

Just wanted to share a common struggle many of us might face – dealing with a parent who's overly concerned about our life and relationships. It can get quite annoying. How do you guys maintain your stoic principles in such situations? How do you keep your cool among well-intentioned but sometimes overwhelming concern?",Stoicism,1706285302.0,t3_1abluhw,0.75,2
"""The slightest movement frightens him(me) out of his life.His baggage makes him(me) a coward""","I read Seneca's letter 63(someone here recommended it)about grieving a death. In the end it said, ""you lost someone you love, now find someone to love"". I took it out of context replacing ""love"" with ""trust"" and death with general rejection. By the way the title is from the letter before 63. But I struggle with trusting again after I've trusted and it has led to being rejected in one form or another. Be it in relationships or in expressing yourself freely as in being who you really are. And yes we are only entitled to our actions and not their results but a statement from Seneca like, ""he who while he gives thinks of what he will get in return deserves to be decieved"" is an oxymoron because aren't we biologically hardwired to expect a return(consciously or unconsciously) and for good reason? To be like ""a bee when the honey is stored"" or, in being virtuous to be the like the sun that shines on all people everyday without judgement regardless of what horrible things they've done is to not account for human emotions(which, let's face it is part of what makes us human). And even if I do the right rational thing, it doesn't eliminate the influences of these emotions. So baggage, what brene brown called ""armor"" for someone with trauma exists to protect me, saying to me, ""if you take off this armor, we die"", but she(Brown) would have you believe that this armor also holds us back from being everything we can be. On some level, I am a coward, regarding love for example because it involves an element of loading my unfinished business(baggage) on someone, expecting to get something from them that I didn't get in the past and ofcourse this is like setting myself up for disappointment because the only one who can fulfill such expectations is me. Meditations 6.20 concludes by saying ""we need to excuse what our sparring partners do and just keep our distance, WITHOUT SUSPICION OR HATRED"" and I ask myself..how?. Epictetus says Archilles was ruined the moment he forgot he was at Troy to fight, not the get women. But if this was preordained by the logos, how can it be considered ruin? Mark Twain wrote that we should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is in it and stop there. I am the cat he talks about. The one that sits down on a hot stove lid. He will never sit down on a hot stove lid again-and that is well, but he will also never sit down on a cold one anymore.I struggle with the past being my master instead of my teacher, because a part of me believes that only as my master can it strengthen my ""memory of the future"". It's only in moments when I'm overwhelmed by an appearance, caught up in a moment, it's only then that my past experiences become non existant and I am able to act boldly and audaciously. Perhaps that's courage?, I don't believe so because in those moments I am not being consciously vulnerable. I don't think I am capable of concious vulnerability, but perhaps ""unconscious vulnerability"" also counts as courage.",Stoicism,1706260007.0,t3_1abe6u7,1.0,3

I didn’t like the idea of my family controlling my life at all. It’s hard because in Nigeria, there’s no future for me at all. I haven’t even started my life in America yet. In America, I have thousands of student college loans debt, unpaid credit card debt, and so many other medical and debt that’s unpaid and could potentially damage my credit score.

Also, getting a job here is difficult and moving to the United States can be very, very hard as hell. I tried to talk to my mom but she doesn’t listen and I have an extremely bad relationship with her. My whole life is basically being thrown away.

How would a Stoic approach working in sports betting industry? (or any other gambling industry for that matter),"I'm about to start work in a new company that handles sports betting. I see the workplace as beneficial for my development with challenging problems, skilled coworkers and good benefits for me and, hopefully at some point in the future, my family. Even though I thought about the moral implications if such a job before accepting the offer, as the start date is approaching I'm starting to question it because at the end of the day it's profiting off of others suffering.

Some argumentation that I thought of is that even if betting shops didn't exist, people would still find ways to lose money due to the reasons why they would bet in the first place, it would just be replaced with something unregulated. This however just seems like a coping mechanism, so I'm curious if there is a Stoic approach that can be taken here and what would be some main guiding points for it.

I am stuck. I need help," 

I am a high school student from India. I am stuck in a situation, which I think, Only stoicism could solve.

Actually I am fooling myself. I am preparing for JEE. world's second toughest exam. Now to main thing

 Whenever there is any test. I try to skip it. Not because I hadn't studied the topics, but because my performance is below my peers. The JEE system pushes  emphasis on your result and ranking. Thus making everybody, ie your fellow classmates, Your potential enemy. Recently I scored 18/100 while the average was 45/100. Now I can handle low points in my life but for 6 months, no matter how hard I try, I never score more than my peers' average.

Also, I've recently started procrastinating. To be honest, This is not procrastination. This is a fear. Actually my dad is obsessed with JEE. But since my performance has been low for a long time, He just says that I am trash. I ignored him for a few months, but now I really feel that I am trash. I am scared of examinations because of my dad's reaction. 

So, Whenever I study and I get stuck on a topic, I really feel that I am trash.

This feeling also takes away all of the fulfilment. And then, whenever I go to my doubts teacher, I feel like an imposter. I feel that I have not studied or I have not done anything meant to be done before doing the question sets. All of these sometimes leaves me hopeless and sometimes suicidal too.

 I believe Journaling can only help to a limit. 

And whenever I sit to study I feel as if it's not worth it . All of the studying is just drama. And I actually do think that I am doing drama.

Then there is another problem. Germany offers free education for people who want to immigrate to Germany for a long time. and whenever I ask whether JEE is worth it or not, a thought always comes that Germany is still my backup option. and then I waste my time dreaming about peaceful german way of doing things instead of the Indian way. (and I really hate my country's work culture) 

You could say ""focus on progress, not perfection), Well here I am. It's been 6 months and I really feel that I have achieved nothing. I gave up on dating girls just so that I could focus on studies, I also moved away from all of my friends who were not interested in studies, Just so that I could focus on myself and I couldn't even do that properly. 

I don't know what stoics would do in this situation. But for me there seems only two ways, One reaching out to someone like you guys and Second, suicide ",Stoicism,1706213026.0,t3_19fidux,0.83,4

"Today I got rejected at the gym, and it felt so good 😊","I consistently see this one particular girl at the gym, she’s nice looking, and several times over a few weeks we make eye contact, and so, naturally, I’m like, okay, she “MIGHT” be into me, maybe, somewhat?

So today, the gym closed at 5 and she happened to be parked next to me, and so, I put my gym stuff in the trunk of my car and before I head to the drivers side, I take a small breath, and I literally say in my head, “stoicism baby, whatever happens it’s cool, not a big deal”
So I go to her, small tap her car and she rolls down her window, I continued to say that I see her often here at the gym, and that I think she’s really pretty, finally I say if she’s seeing someone. She says she is but she is very flattered that I even came and did this.
I said “oh hey no worries! what a lucky man he must be! Well! I won’t take too much of your time, thank you!”
Finally she asked me what my name is and I said my name, and she said hers, and then it was farewell after that.

In the end I was completely satisfied with being rejected because it’s a step forward, and I’m glad I did this 😊

My father committed suicide today.,"11/16/2019

Today, my father committed suicide by firing a gunshot into his head while parked behind a church in his work vehicle. 

He left a 10 page suicide note full of love for his family and friends, a blood splatter on the front page, a claim that he was a victim to big pharma in the middle of the note, and a list of what he found to be his inadequacies on the very back of the notebook. 

He viewed himself as ugly things in that moment. He made that clear by labeling himself “ugly, unhealthy, alone”, and more. He wasn’t any of the things he listed. His perspective was warped and he reached a hell no one could help him escape.

He had been struggling with a deep depression for the past few months, but had fostered an amount of poor habits for as long as I remember. Amongst them were poor diet and leisure choices and subscription to negative ideologies relating to currents events, politics, and people. He had recently attempted to switch his medication in hopes he could eventually not rely on any anti-depressants. I had also tried to give him a psychedelic mushroom experience a few weeks ago, but he experienced no effects at all. He was desperate for a way out of depression. He was willing to try any medical regiment, pill, or operation, but he didn’t seem to be able to gather the strength necessary to make lifestyle changes. Prior to this bout of depression, and for as long as I can remember, he had struggled with a very painful gut condition that remained undiagnosed by dozen’s of medical professionals. They couldn’t find anything wrong with him, but he never didn’t feel pain in his stomach. 

My dad had a poor relationship with his father, who had a poor relationship with his father. My grandfather didn’t seem to open up for emotional discourse, and that passed onto my dad. My grandfather didn’t seem to love my sweet grandmother, who had MS. My dad also had a brother who died of cancer before I was born. I think this is the event that caused the creation of many of his bad habits, as I’m told his brother was his best friend and that they did everything together. My dad took care of my grandmother when my grandfather died, and provided her his own home and a caregiver while he lived with her, but struggled to treat her with decency. He would often berate her when she had an accident or was in his way as he was walking about the house. 

All of that being said, that is not an accurate way to view my father. All people have struggles, demons, and shortcomings.

He was viewed by his friends and family as larger-than-life, uplifting, and a source of endless humor. He had more friends than anyone else I can think of. Random groups of people gathered around him when he was at the gym to listen to his jokes. (I have subconsciously told many of his jokes throughout the course of my life, but never gave him credit for his humor. The truth is, he was actually pretty damn funny.) His girlfriend told him that he gave her the best years of her life, and he reciprocated that sentiment to her. He always praised me for how smart he thought I was and how confident and proud he was in me. He worked hard, almost to a fault. He made the city’s he worked for safer and held up his end of society’s bargain. He gave his friends what many of them gave him: a helping hand at a moment’s notice. 

Up until today, I was never impressed with my father. I didn’t see the deeper causations of his shortcomings. I thought he over-ate, over-sexualized, possessed ideologies, succumbed to lethargy, and failed to emotional express himself, all as a result of his own choice. This isn’t true. My dad was never equipped by the people around him to handle the burden he was facing, which was primarily caused by not being equipped for any possible emotional burden. 

Today, I am extremely impressed and proud of my father. I saw the family he created from 3 separate families gather and love each other for him. I saw the emotional impact his friendship had on his friends. I realized that he did the very best he could with what he was given. He handled his circumstance as well as anyone could have. 

I was rough on dad during this depression. I realize I was. I told him there was no shortcuts. I told him there was no going back to his old life, because his old life of seemingly “happiness” but still the cultivation of poor habits was the reason he was depressed. I told him even if he could go back, I would reject it, because I didn’t want him to be that way. I read to him from a few books. I got him in to see my therapist, but I don’t think he returned for a second visit. I meditated with him once. I made him a meal to show him he could do it on his own. I gave him a specific book to follow along with as the audio book played in his headphones. He only read, to my knowledge, 3 chapters before his death. I believe if he would have finished it, he would not have done this. My father didn’t know how to take care of himself within his own head, and no one provided him with the tools necessary to be able to learn how to do that. No matter what I or anyone said to him, he wasn’t able to see the light at the end of the tunnel. This frustrated me. It shouldn’t have. I get it now. 

I told him the truth. I told him a pill didn’t cause this and wouldn’t fix it. I knew medication surely wasn’t helping, but I knew his anti-depressant dependency was a symptom, not the cause, of his depression. I told him the only way out was to create routines that would be miserable, hard work, for weeks before they would begin to reveal themselves as good. 

I accept my responsibility in his death although people tell me I shouldn’t. They all should too. If I wanted to help him more in the moment, I would have. I did not. I neglected him when I should have been with him. I didn’t call him many days. I isolated myself from him for months earlier in the year, which could have single-handedly created this increased depressive state. If I had considered he was capable of suicide, my approach would be kinder and more vulnerable. I do believe I could have kept him alive. This is my burden and I will not be changing my mind for the foreseeable future.

It is hard to picture my father pulling a trigger on himself. It is hard to picture my father immensely hating himself in his final moments. It is hard to know he considered himself a burden to his loved ones during his depression. He was not a burden. It was difficult. It hurt. It was stressful. We selfishly made it about us on accident. But he wasn’t a burden. This is a burden. 

I didn’t know much about my dad because he was very emotionally closed off. My goal is to learn more about him for the rest of my life so I can understand why everyone hailed him as a hero while he was alive, instead of how I only see that now that he is gone. 

It’s painfully obvious now he was a lovely man. He was an absolute stud. He had a special smile. He had a community that was magnetically constructed from his personality built around him. He gave me everything I needed to be successful and is the sole reason I am equipped to handle the tragedy. He was pure selflessness incarnate to the ones he loved. He was moral and knew the difference from right and wrong. He was a man of leisure, outdoorsmanship, and sportsmanship.

He is somewhere now where he is calm and his anxieties no longer plague him. He is where he is most comfortable. He will make that clear to his loved ones in due time. 

I share this with the stoicism Reddit out of respect for the users and what we try our best to practice. I know I can't change this event. My goal now is to improve and set the ultimate example for others to keep them out of this hell. Thank you for listening.

When the end comes the most surprising thing is how nothing changes,"So a little context before i start: im going to pass away this week, probably not more than a few days away now.

&#x200B;

My reason for posting here is asking for some advice, maybe some help with reflection on how to remain stoic in a situation like this, or perhaps just someone to wave me off. Im having what can only be described as an incredibly vast mess of emotions raging within me, competing for dominance, anything from fear to sadness, happiness and excitement, and of course confusion. But the one im struggling the most with is how nothing seems to have changed around me. That life moves forwards for everyone else while i seemingly stand still is such a surreal feeling which makes this so unreal. I wake up like any other day, but with the knowledge that its soon over. That im not going to catch the next episode of that TV show, how im not going to read that new novel, or try that new game with my friends.

Fear because im afraid of what comes after, if anything at all. That there could be nothing, is just as scary as what could be. Sadness because i have had to distance myself from friends, also a factor in leading me to post here anonymously. Happiness because i wont need to worry about the physical pain and further deteriorating body, that i dont need to question whether or not i have eaten in the past few days. Excitement because of what could be, maybe there is a vast world that i get to explore without being ill. and confusion because all of these emotions exist and act out simultaneously.

I opted for not being in the hospital, and instead in the relative comfort of my own home. Im feeling very conflicted as i clean what i can, tidy, throw away things, and generally prepare myself for maybe not waking up the next day. The recurring theme is that none of this feels real to me yet, I expected things to be different, for the world to say something back to me. But all im met with is the little comfort normality brings, although I am feeling disappointed and confused that nothing is different around me.

If youve gotten this far, thank you for reading this. That someone is even taking the time to read this means a lot to me, because it makes me feel a just a little bit better, because maybe someone would be able to understand just a little bit of what im feeling through this text.


EDIT: To everyone that is reading and commenting, i try to reply to as many as i can, but know that you are already doing more than i could have hoped for from a stranger. All of the comments in this post bring me an amazing sense of calm i could never have imagined I'd get. So many people engaging with me makes me feel a sense of calm in the storm i didn't think was possible, you guys are all giving me the feeling that it's going to be ok. That it's just the next step. That you all have given me the thing i treasure the most right now, your time and attention, so to everyone reading and commenting, thank you.

EDIT 2: I believe no time is wasted if it's spent doing what you want or what you enjoy.

Observations by a dying stoic,"Some things I've contemplated over the past week or so.  

1) I’m glad I came to Stoicism before I got the terminal diagnosis. I see a lot of people looking into Stoicism for a coping strategy when faced with big issues or problems. For me that would come too late, I think. In my case I’ve spent a good deal of time already contemplating my death and my place in the universe. Accepting the diagnosis on a personal level was easier than it might have been otherwise. 

2) The main struggle for me was with how to tell my family. I was concerned about how they would take it and was waffling about should share it I right now or should I wait a bit. Many of you advised sooner rather than later. I took that advice and have told my wife and family and friends near and far. The response has been humbling. As has often been quoted, ""We often suffer more in our imagination than in reality.""  I have not told my boss or coworkers at this point. My reason for that is that I think it would be distracting right now when there is nothing for them to do one way or the other. 

3) I have not asked my Doctor for a time frame. Not because I don’t want to face it, but because I don’t believe it’s helpful. Those are just statistics and they don’t dictate the outcome. I’m focused on the right things and my affairs will be in order in the next couple of weeks. Whether I have 3 months or 1 year or can achieve complete remission won’t change how I plan to live my life day to day.

4) The upcoming struggle will be to have no expectations...lol...I'll keep you posted.",Stoicism,1612212995.0,t3_ladw2x,1.0,2618

No one cares about your life,"I know the title is a bit pessimistic, but hear me out.

We're the center of our world. Since we were born, literally our entire existence is seen from our own viewpoint. Thats why we think we're so important. people have social anxiety, because they think everyone is paying attention to them. These days, people do so much things to impress others, to be accepted, comparing themselves to others.

But at the end of the day, its a tough lesson to learn that really, no one cares. Yes, you have friends and family who truly care about your life. But for the most part, no one is even remotely as invested in your life as you are yourself. You see someone on the street wearing super expensive clothes, or a homeless guy. Are you thinking about them when you go to sleep? do you worry about their future? probably not even close to the way you think about your own life.

so really no one cares. we are not special. billions have come before us, and billions will come after us. You could spend the rest of your life in depression, or being the happiest guy on the planet, either way the world will keep spinning, everyone else will keep living their own lives. So what was the point of this post? Of course, one of the biggest stoicism principles is understanding whats in your control and whats not. We gotta back ourselves up. we gotta live our lives for what we want, stop worrying so much about others, what they think, what they do, where they are. At the end of the day all we truly have is ourselves. We gotta be there for ourselves in the lowest times and the most difficult trials.",Stoicism,1598067074.0,t3_iebel4,0.98,2597

"Everyone is going through a tragedy. They don't stop coming, they come more frequently. Life doesnt get better, but we do.","2019 was a tough year and I became very self absorbed. I lost 3 friends including my best to drugs, suicide, and more suicide in a very short span of time. I lost another friend to murder. Another best friend was sleeping with another best friends wife. Destroyed the group.

 We've all been the tightest friends since highschool for over a decade, I felt like my whole world was ripped apart piece by piece.  All I wanted was for it to stop and for things to just get better. It doesnt. Grandpa has cancer throughout his entire body.  Mom lost her job and needs surgery (Thank god we live in canada). I broke up with a woman I probably should have married, but instead blamed her for some of my unhappiness and I hurt her. A lot.

Just to top things off I was also working 16 hour days at 3 jobs, while studying for my real estate license, while coaching wrestling as a volunteer, while volunteering at the hospital on fridays. I never took a single day off, except the morning one of my friends died, my boss told me to go home from training because I was distracted. I failed my 3rd real estate exam the week my best friend died, cost over $1000 to retake. At my other jobs I would cry in the bathroom and blame the time spent on constipation. 3/4 of my finances were lost in the stock market that I did not keep up with. I gained weight and became very antisocial and self absorbed.

To be honest there were mornings I would be driving the work truck and be contemplating suicide. But I told myself I just needed to ride it out, things would get better.

But it took me even longer to realise that I'm strong enough to bare the burdens of life. And that I needed to be more responsible. And that's what is most important.

Things get better when you have time to think about them. I quit the jobs i hated, I'm a full time realtor now, I've had a lot more time to think. I fell in love again, and felt rejection for the first time.

 But wow what an awesome part of life, to be able to love so much is a blessing even if they don't feel the same way and turns out they only wanted you for one thing (bit of salt there still). I spend every day I can with my grandparents, whom I knew I took for granted. I LOVE my new job as a realtor, I love my athletes that I coach, I love when the patients at the hospital tell me how much they appreciate me, and knowing that I can do something for them and not getting anything in return. No one but my parents and my ex girlfriends know I volunteer. I love every minute of my life.

I want to share this journal entry with anyone reading that life doesnt get any better, but we do, and when we do our best, it makes life better for everyone. I'm a genuinely happy person again. People are much more attracted to me again. I'm able to give so much more again. My closest friends ask how I'm able to give away so much of myself, with how much money and time I spend on others. My cup is over flowing, happiness doesnt come from your savings account. It might be different for everyone, but from this stoic, it comes from how much I can give.

Thanks for reading to the bottom, I hope your 2020 is the best you've been yet.

*edit*

I really appreciate my first reddit Gold and I really appreciate that my little journal entry had an affect on people in a positive way. Thanks everyone. I want to add that although I appreciate it, and i dont want to sound ungrateful, but money is better spent on doing something to help ease someone elses tragedies!

Thank you so much. Happy new year everyone",Stoicism,1577372254.0,t3_efwbyk,0.99,2452

I haven't told my wife or family yet because I am struggling with the impact it will have on my loved ones.  I keep imagining my wife alone in the house, my kids losing their dad, my parents losing a son, etc.  I know those are externals but I need some help getting there.

I am spending my time making sure my affairs are in order to reduce the burden on them after I am gone. So that is one benefit of the slow roll instead of being taken out by a bus, but the overwhelming part is how this will hit them.  

Could use some help orienting to this. I am at peace with my own demise, but maybe not? because I am struggling with how others will be impacted.  I know that is their path to walk, but I'm stoic, not uncaring.

UPDATE: I told my wife last night, over the phone. (Out of town helping my Dad while my Mom's in the hospital.) Man, you never know the grace and strength of those who love you until it's tested. She has of course known something's not right, with the symptoms, tests, etc.  So this first big hurdle is now started.

Holy fuck stop using stoicism to become an emotionless punching bag and take action to solve problems,"Holy fuck the amount of ppl not understanding stoicism wastes their youth.

Stoicism isn't a pill you take to not feel pain.

It's not something you use as an excuse to NOT handle your problems. 

The goal isnt to become a fucking souless and heartless uncaring person unable to feel emotion.

Guys turn to stoicism since not feeling is a masculine legacy, but men take action to solve problems and become stronger and get better providing, protecting, etc.

""Oh I got yelled at/I'm broke/family member died so I should be resilient bc I can't change it so I shouldnt care"" is a common and  fucked up interpretation of stoicism.

Yes, you can't revive the dead, but you can solve the root problems, trauma making you grieve.

Go talk back to the person who yelled at you
Go get skills and get paid more
Go to therapy and deal with trauma



The goal is not just to be selective and solve the problems you can solve, but to understand the root of your problem and solve that.

Cool you're not tall enough? No use crying about being short? No....The problem is you feel unconfident. So get things that would make you confident in other ways e.g. more money, better clothes, better communication skills,

If you get punched or emotionally berated and use stoicism as a masculine mask to cope, it means you're not dealing with it. It's going to keep happening. And you're not a punching bag.

Yif you don't solve the problem influencing your feelings and life at it's source, you'll keep getting hurt and coping sounds like you can't change... That it's ok to continue to keep being hurt.



If I'm sad or want to be stoic while I'm broke, fuck that. Do something about that.

Stoicism isn't about rolling with the punches. It's about taking action on what you should and can take action on.

Fuck. 

If you got some shit to do, post it below and do it.
Take action, and don't be a souless punching bag unwilling to stop the punches.",Stoicism,1666204453.0,t3_y8ag4r,0.92,2258
Potentially my last message,"**Potentially my last message**

I'm writing this, knowing that I will soon be dead and forgotten. 

A couple of people might think of me for years after my death, but eventually these will die too, and nobody will remember that I ever existed.  

Reddit might still be a thing in 1000 years, and this post might still exist by then. However, it will not remain like that forever. At some point in the future, even the internet will cease to exist. 

Humans will cease to exist, the universe will cease to exist. 

Every track of me will be erased. Nobody will be able to tell that I ever lived. It will be like I didn't even live in the first place.  

**You're not missing out** 

A couple of years ago, I would have a panic attack reading this. 

I believed I was gonna change the world.

I wanted to make my mark on the world so badly - so that I could be remembered forever.  

Now I'm strangely okay with this.

Why? 

Because I have realized that nothing lasts forever. The only constant in this world is change. 

Since nothing else lasts forever, I am not missing out on anything. In fact, everyone else will eventually suffer the same fate as me. 

If everyone suffers the same fate, our fate can neither be good, nor bad.  

It's just the way it is.   

**Valar Morghulis**

I'm sure you have seen those creepy gravestones: 

* Remember stranger, as you pass by,

* As you are now, so once was I.

* As I am now you soon will be,

* Prepare yourself for eternity. (to follow me.)  

These are surprisingly accurate.

We must all die. We must all be forgotten. We must all follow each other into eternity. 

Valar Morghulis. Memento Mori. 

We are in this together. 

**Our destination is the same**

Life is like a giant maze. 

We can take so many different paths. 

We think that one path is better than the other. 

But we don't realize that all of the paths end up in the same place.        

Once we realize that our destination is the same, we can escape the maze. We can escape our ego. 

We become chill. We cease to worry. Problems are no longer problems. 

**So what now?**

Once we realize that the maze is a joke, we also go through an existential crisis.

Sure, we might not have any problems anymore, but we also don't have any goals. 

What should we do with our lives then? Why even live? 

I'd reverse the question and ask: Why not? 

If you can live entirely without problems, what is so bad about living? Why would you want to end it? 

Sure, there are things you dislike here in life. But you only dislike these things because you still believe in the maze. You believe that you must take a specific path. Once you realize that the maze is an illusion, and that all paths end up in the same place, you become indifferent about the path you are taking. 

1 billion dollars in debt? Severely handicapped from an accident? Chronic health issues? Wife left you? Living on the streets? Nobody cares about you?

That's one path. It's as good as any other path. Ultimately, they all end up in the same place. 

**Life is like Minecraft**

I'd equate life to playing Minecraft. There is no specific goal. You can't win. You can't lose. But you'll still keep playing. Why? Because playing isn't so bad, and you have no incentive to quit. You'll make up some kind of goal for yourself. 

Personally, I've made it my goal to make some of the other players suffer less. Have fewer problems. 

That's my path. I know it's as good as any path, but I still choose it, cause I need to move my character somewhere. I'm already playing the game. I have zero reason to quit it. 

Maybe the path will be difficult, maybe it will turn narrow. Maybe I will have to abandon it. Maybe I will have to take a different path. I won't be disappointed about that. I know where I'm gonna end up.   

**Take your lunch now and attend to death later**

As Epictetus said: 

*I have to die. If it is now, well then I die now; if later, then now I will take my lunch* 

Do the same as Epictetus. 

Take your lunch and eat it, while being in a state of complete equanimity. 

Realize that there is nothing negative about death. 

You don't have to suffer, while eating.

"As the President of the USA reports testing positive for COVID-19, a reminder that it is wrong to take pleasure in another’s pain","This is the passion called epicaricacy, and it is unreasonable because it reaches beyond what is one’s own and falsely claims the pain of another as a good.

When wisdom tells you what to do then do it without complaining, because complaining just gives way to suffering. If you do find yourself complaining then it might be time to reevaluate your judgements and beliefs. 

I have brain damage and life can be overwhelming. Things that were once second nature now take enormous amounts of energy. It is easy for me to become discouraged on days when I have to retrain myself, as a parent would a toddler, but it is even more difficult when I give into complaining. I want to be taking big steps, but I’m not going to get there without taking small steps. Seeing the bigger picture turns mundane chore into a strength building challenge.

"I can’t control this sub’s inclination to pickup artistry, but I can warn its subscribers...","All, 

Several years ago, I stumbled into stoicism and found it resonated with me. No doubt, having the emotional strength to accept which you cannot change and the courage to change that which you can, can improve your life in many aspects, and dating is certainly one of them. 

However, I have seen a number of posts that hyperfixate on the link between pickup artistry and stoicism. I think, as many of you do here, that you almost have to be a stoic to try and implement any pickup artistry strategies, but oh my god you guys, when did this subreddit turn into r/seddit? 

I see a lot of young men here getting into stoicism and falsely believing that the problem with their dating life or the reason they’re still single is because of their emotional response to rejection when they act in unattractive ways. Earlier today, a young man posted about how he tried to cold open a woman by tapping on her window like a highway cop after following her out of the gym, and literally 150 of you guys were like “great job king”, which [edit] is consistent with a pattern of young men misapplying stoicism to “cold open” flirting approaches 

Enough- part of being a stoic is acknowledging and being humbled in the face of knowing that you may, unfortunately, be a maladjusted, socially inept individually who requires serious, serious therapy and rehabbing of ones social skills in tandem with stoicism. It would be very disappointing if many of you were misled to believe that your failures in life were exacerbated not by your lack of maturity or knowledge, but solely by your emotional responses to failure. 

That is, *if you were drawn to stoicism because you felt bad about something bad in your life, and believe that simply thinking away your bad emotional response to that problem will automatically make it go away* is batshit insane. 


Back to this young gentleman who cold opened a woman in a parking lot- clearly, this poor kid was unaware that his conduct would be interpreted by most reasonable people as predatory and a gross violation of social norms. Yes, using stoicism to dial your emotions back in unsuccessful dating flirting situations is good, but Jesus Herbert Christ, do not think that Qui-Gon Jinning your way through life without the tools to actually succeed (mainly, a baseline set of social skills) is going to bring you happiness. 


Moral of the story- if you were drawn to stoicism because you struggle with social anxiety, dating troubles or professional conduct, you must first examine the underlying problems with your conduct and what needs fixing, *then* ask whether your emotions are getting in the way of implementing that solution. Do not use stoicism as a crutch for your bad behavior.

Stoicism can and should be practiced in tandem with feminism.

Second edit: 

If you think that approaching a woman while she is in her car, doors closed, windows down, after she has left the gym, and tapping on her window so you can tell her she is pretty and ask her if she is single, after being prompted to do so because, even though you had no prior conversations with this woman, you had a feeling that she may be interested in you after a series of eye-contact exchanges and nothing else, is *not* an unreasonable reason, place, time and manner to approach a woman you’re interested in, and isn’t a violation of reasonable social norms, and *wouldn’t* cause most women to feel uncomfortable, this post is not for you, as it means we fundamentally disagree on what is a healthy and well adjusted way to conduct oneself in public and will probably not see eye to eye.

Third edit: 

To clarify the point to be made here: You cannot violate reasonable social norms, suffer anxiety about being rejected or ostracized for violating those boundaries, and then expect to overcome said anxiety by curbing your emotional response through stoicism. If I shower once a week and experience ostracization for it, I should not use stoicism to get over my fear of rejection for being stinky. I should just take a shower more frequently. Part of growth and maturity is accepting that some social norms are *good*, some conformity is *good* and respecting them is part of being a normal, happy, well adjusted adult, while some norms should be challenged because they perpetuate injustice. 

If you lack basic social skills, such as being able to distinguish situations in which it would or would not be appropriate to compliment a woman and ask her is she is single, you will probably experience some ostracization. Using stoicism to curb your fear of that rejection will not work, because you haven’t addressed the underlying problem thats leading to rejection in the first place - grossly violating social norms. Re: parking lot guy, if you can’t understand the problem with his behavior, you probably share some of the underlying problems that that OP has, too, and this post isn’t for you.

Fourth edit: for some of you that can’t understand why parking lot OP’s conduct violated social norms, consider the following analogy. Have you ever taken an Uber or a Lyft really early in the morning? Like 20 minutes after you’ve woken up and before you got coffee? And the driver immediately starts asking you where you’re going and why and you just want to scream “asshole, one, it’s none of your business, two it’s 6:15 in the morning and I’m not here to chat so can it!” except the reason the Uber driver is talking to you is because they want to fuck you instead of because they’re bored or lonely or anxious for 5 stars, and you can’t really ignore them because if you do they might get offended and pull the car over and kick the shit out of you, so you give them half-assed one word answers while staring out the window to appease them in the hopes they leave it alone, then you’re on the right track to understanding why *that* OP is violating social norms, and if you still don’t get it, this post is DEFINITELY NOT FOR YOU.

Stoicism has resonated with me the most out of the philosophies, but holy shit lol. Some of y'all got make the most out of literally nothing. Similar to the meme about the blue curtains in english class. I discovered stoicism when I needed it most and I'm sure some of you have as well, but lads, lighten up.  

Marcus Aurelius said something similar to ""Give up your thirst for books, so that you do not die a grouch."" I think that can be interpreted as any form of education/growth. 

Don't get wrong, some of your posts are great. Dealing with your friends falling ill or losing a loved one. It's inspiring to see you apply what you've learn in reality. 

Just don't make me scroll through 10 paragraphs of how Karen cut you at Wendy's and you didn't lose your shit on her. Same goes for stretching out a mundane inconvenience with big words and other filler.

"""In everything that you do, pause and ask yourself if death is a dreadful thing because it deprives you of this."" - Marcus Aurelius","Since this subreddit has seen a burst in activity, I thought it would be nice to greet newcomers with and explain to them, my favourite quote of all time.

Yes, the quote without context is macabre. But when you look at it the way (I only assume) it was intended, it is quite the most uplifting sentiment there is.

Life is a string of events, most of them greatly inconsequential, a great many of them uncomfortable or indifferent, and a select few, fulfilling.

As is clear from this breakdown, one could do away without the majority of life and it would remain more or less the same in the end. 

But the quote concerns itself with what *you* do, not what is done unto you by others or by nature.

What are you doing right now? Are you doing something with no end in sight, just going through the motions? Will you be proud of it when you die, if you are blessed with a moment to look back upon your life?

Or are you doing something fulfilling, that you may be a better person thanks to it? Are you reading when you ought to be reading, pursuing your hobbies, taking care of your family?

Are you jacking off, binge-watching the most pointless string of videos, taking one too many rest days, delaying whatever it is that you know needs doing?

It's easy to divide these between ""this will give me a prouder death"" and ""this will make me rue the fact that I could have used a little more of my time when I still had it, but wasted it.""

Despite nuance, despite complexity, at the end of the day you know which box your next move falls in. Take accountability for your own life, don't live life from the passenger's seat.

"Whenever you find yourself upset, pay close attention to what false appearance/expectation you had that led to the discomfort. This is how you grow as a Stoic.","Stoics believe that every distress that we encounter, however minor or major, is caused by a poor expectation or assumption that we made. To become unconquerable, then, is to forsake the perceptions that society teaches you, to not assume that a person will act in such a way, and to not make any expectations about what the future holds. This is how Socrates openly welcomed a death sentence. This is how Epictetus dealt with being enslaved and crippled with such equanimity. This is how a Stoic becomes invincible. 

Upset that you broke your leg? Did you expect your leg to be unbreakable? Why are you so convinced that a broken leg is a bad thing? 

Angry that you lost your job? Why did you assume that it was in your power to keep it? You do not control the economy, the industry you work in, or your boss, so why did you think you controlled whether or not you stayed employed there?

Sad that a loved one died? Who told you that they would live forever? How could you not see it coming? For everyone and everything dies eventually. 

I should add that it is okay, and natural to *feel* things when things happen. What I am talking about here is you ruminating, dwelling, wallowing, and otherwise playing the ""woe is me"" card for days on end. ***Feeling*** **an emotion is a natural, momentary, human response that is more or less inevitable.** ***Thinking*** **an emotion is an intentional choice, and oftentimes an unnecessary reaction to something after the initial feeling has subsided.**

**Tl;dr**: False perceptions and assumptions of control over things you do not will necessarily lead to disappointment and distress. The faster you can assimilate reality instead of thinking you can change it, the happier you will be.",Stoicism,1603450129.0,t3_jgkt6i,0.99,1960
7 principles to a peaceful life,"During the last lock-down, I had a lot of time to think about life. I came to the conclusion with 7 principles that I follow every time I find myself miserable. Later, when I was writing a seminar paper on stoicism, I connected most of the principles to stoicism. I thought sharing them with you.

1. Know what is and what is not in your control. Do not control what is not in your control
2. Be and do what you want others to be and do. Do not expect them to be and do what you want them to be and do.
3. Do not judge others. They have their own reasons. They live their own life.
4. Do not respond to others judging you. As long as you are not purposefully hurting them, it is them and not you, do not let it become you.
5. Without your reaction, everything is powerless.
6. Try to look at all the sides. Do not worship, but if you do, look at it from all perspectives.
7. Life is not a problem to be solved but a reality to be experienced. You do not know shit, you will never know shit, just dance and enjoy the show, love and care and love and care will come.

Hope it will help anyone. Peace, love, WATN",Stoicism,1606210955.0,t3_k0227l,0.99,1952
"""Captain your own ship but do not attempt to command the sea.""","Excerpt from William Ferraiolo's Meditations On Self Discipline and Failure: 

""Detach yourself emotionally and psychologically from the news of the day. Do not ignore it. Do not attempt to pretend it away, or imagine brighter possibilities than the available evidence can support. An escapist delusion is not a solution to any problem, and it is no proper part of any plan to address future contingencies. You must pay attention, but you must not allow your peace of mind to depend upon events magically conforming to your wishful thinking or your stubbornly held expectations. In fact, hope is always misplaced when it is vested in the vicissitudes of the political, social, or economic spheres. Your hopes are to be attached only to your own efforts of will, and your own diligent attention to self-discipline. You must hope that you have the fortitude to meet the challenges that you encounter. Captain your own ship, and chart a course toward wisdom and virtue. Do not, however, insist upon commanding the sea.""",Stoicism,1581883946.0,t3_f4we63,0.99,1951
Be prepared to be alone,"This doesn't mean you won't find a girlfriend or wife, boyfriend or husband. This doesn't mean you won't have long lasting and meaningful relationships.

This means there will be a time, likely many, that you are the only one practicing a philosophy which emphasizes virtue, and focuses on the highest good.

There will be times when you won't be able to relate to the ones who you associate with.

That's fine. Don't stoop to anyone's level, merely for their benefit, or worse, for your own.

I saw death today,"I had an interesting experience today. A friend of mine sent me a video today, it was a video of New York in 1911.

The first realization I had was that all of these people are now dead. You see them walking down the streets. Some going to work others going back home from work, they are just living their normal lives.

Just like you and me. We are all in the exact same boat with one universal fate for all of us. That got me thinking of how many great people have died since we have known time. Warriors, scholars ,poets, artists, scientists, mathematicians, athletes ect.

Use death as motivation, you have a limited resource which is time. Appreciate it. Don't waste too much time dwelling in the past or thinking about what others think of you. Do what you feels right to do, learn that which you want to learn, go on adventures when the an opportunity presents itself, be courageous in time of desperation, be yourself.

My mum passed away,"My mum was rushed to hospital Friday night and passed away on Saturday. I managed to get there at midnight on Friday after contacting the hospital and they informed me that she'd suffered a very serious brain hemmorhhage.

Mum was unconscious and needed life support. The doctor told me that I should get any family to come by immediately as her condition could deteriorate at any moment. I have two little sisters (13 and 14) and mum is our only parent. The doctor told me that bringing them was a personal choice as seeing our mum like that would be quite traumatic.

I called close family and had them come down along with my sisters. They stayed til 6am then went home for some rest. The doctor performed a pain stimulus test on mum at 9am. I thought she was fairly responsive (limbs jerking) but the doctor took me aside and said that mum had suffered a catastrophic bleed and that there was no consciousness left.

As next of kin I was responsible for calling family and friends to bring them down as quickly as possible. Mum's condition worsened twice but was stabilised each time. Everyone had an opportunity to say their goodbyes before close family and I had a second meeting where the staff repeated the chat we'd had.

We supported mums organ donation (found out yesterday that the recipients of her heart and kidneys are progressing well). We ended up leaving at 6pm after the second doctor performed a pain stimulus test to confirm their decision.

The reality of becoming a new guardian to my sisters, mum's death and being responsible for all the decisions as next of kin have been overwhelming.

I've been trying to lose weight for a while now, and often walk into all the same pitfalls that people with similar goals sometimes do. In trying to resist the craving for junk food, I was contemplating why I was being unreasonable and weak-willed. This is the conclusion I came to.

I realise that it's hardly a profound revelation, and not particularly original, and it wasn't inspired by any heroic undertaking of a great hardship.... But the realisation struck me hard enough that I felt compelled to post about it.

I think that it was also in part a self-response to trying to figure out the Epictetus quote-

""Concentrate every minute like a Roman- like a man- on doing what's in front of you with precise and genuine seriousness, tenderly, willingly, with justice. And on freeing yourself from all other distractions. Yes, you can- if you do everything as if it were the last thing you were doing in your life, and stop being aimless, stop letting your emotions override what your mind tells you, stop being hypocritical, self-centered , irritable. You see how few things you have to do to live a satisfying and reverent life? If you can manage this, that's all even the gods can ask of you."" 

This quote really struck me as particularly relevant to my life because attention/concentration has always been something that I lacked. It has also recently become one of the highest priorities for me as a skill I'm trying to develop. There is a drastic, noticeable difference between the days that I am focused and engaged and the days where I allow my mind to wander and don't have any particular aim. In the former scenario, I feel much better - like being in a consistent state of flow, clearly aware of my intentions and keeping my emotions/actions under careful control.

Seneca, Moral Letters to Lucilius, [Letter 1](https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_1)

>The mind that is untroubled and tranquil has the power to roam into all the parts of its life; but the minds of the engrossed, just as if weighted by a yoke, cannot turn and look behind. And so their life vanishes into an abyss; and as it does no good, no matter how much water you pour into a vessel, if there is no bottom to receive and hold it, so with time—it makes no difference how much is given; if there is nothing for it to settle upon, it passes out through the chinks and holes of the mind. Present time is very brief, so brief, indeed, that to some there seems to be none; for it is always in motion, it ever flows and hurries on; it ceases to be before it has come...

Seneca, On the Shortness of Life, [Chapter X](https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/On_the_shortness_of_life/Chapter_X)

>But those who forget the past, neglect the present, and fear for the future have a life that is very brief and troubled; when they have reached the end of it, the poor wretches perceive too late that for such a long while they have been busied in doing nothing.  [...] All postponement of something they hope for seems long to them. Yet the time which they enjoy is short and swift, and it is made much shorter by their own fault; for they flee from one pleasure to another and cannot remain fixed in one desire. Their days are not long to them, but hateful; yet, on the other hand, how scanty seem the nights which they spend in the arms of a harlot or in wine! [...] They lose the day in expectation of the night, and the night in fear of the dawn.

Seneca, On the Shortness of Life, [Chapter XVI](https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/On_the_shortness_of_life/Chapter_XVI)

>And why is it that even their joys are uneasy from fear? Because they do not rest on stable causes, but are perturbed as groundlessly as they are born. [...] For everything that comes to us from chance is unstable, and the higher it rises, the more liable it is to fall. Moreover, what is doomed to perish brings pleasure to no one; very wretched, therefore, and not merely short, must the life of those be who work hard to gain what they must work harder to keep. By great toil they attain what they wish, and with anxiety hold what they have attained; meanwhile they take no account of time that will never more return.

Seneca, On the Shortness of Life, [Chapter XVII](https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/On_the_shortness_of_life/Chapter_XVII)

So what's the solution? How does one live life without squandering it? 

Use your time wisely; that is, rise to the demands of your circumstances while keeping your will in accordance with nature and humanity. View events (past, present, and future) and the role they define for you with acceptance, even embrace them with gratitude, and you won't be troubled either by things that have happened, things that are happening, or things that are yet to be. 

That's the payoff: you'll *own* the hours you've lived, and you'll have confidence that you'll own the hours that are yet to be. 

When your happiness is generated by making virtuous decisions rather than deceiving yourself into thinking you own or control people and things, when your satisfaction depends on exercising your will, keeping it in harmony, and honestly owning your choices, then the past, present, and future are all places you can visit with comfort and confidence.

>The life of the philosopher, therefore, has wide range, and he is not confined by the same bounds that shut others in. He alone is freed from the limitations of the human race; all ages serve him as if a god. Has some time passed by? This he embraces by recollection. Is time present? This he uses. Is it still to come? This he anticipates. He makes his life long by combining all times into one.

I stepped out of the car, immediately checked on the guys in front of me, asking them if they were hurt (thankfully no one was). They were just about to start cursing but my question and composure startled them, and they simply followed my guidance in trying to contain the situation.

I informed them to call the authorities, while I go to check on the driver behind me - still in her car. She was in a state of shock, crying. I asked her if she's hurt, and when I verified that she wasn't, calmed her down as best I could. These things happen, no one is hurt, c'est la vie.

Finally I guided everyone to the side of the road for safety. The authorities came and we filed out the paperwork. Everyone was by this point relatively calm, and I felt a sense of respect from all parties. An unfortunate situation all round, yet I think an experience which all the affected parties learnt from, and which put my Stoic virtues to the test. I dare say I'm proud of myself!

"Buddhism and Stoicism both strive for tranquility and inner peace, yet approach it from different handles in rhetoric. Buddhism by what is not in our control (Dukkha, Samsara). Stoicism by what is (Virtue, Reason).","**Personal background:** For the longest time I've been a pessimist. Ever since around the age of sixteen, when, in a desperate search to answer why to the anxieties of my life and the shitty things the people around me were going through, I over-read everything from neuroscience that proved human free will false (Libbet experiments, unconscious biases, genetic factors in personality, etc) to hobbesian like studies into violent human nature in history and evolutionary psychology to post modernism, Nietzsche, and pessimists like Schopenhauer and Cioran and Ligotti to recent studies on catastrophic climate change. I've been in a state of deep negativity and hopelessness and fatalism, declaring life not only bleak but actively malignant for it's asymmetry in pain and pleasure (anti-natalism, Benatar), even actively praising and contemplating suicide. and sometimes testing myself.

**One of the subjects I over-read was Buddhism**, thinking it would help me from all the self-help industry around it, and yet I found it's bleak archives on it's analysis of Dukkha to contribute to my nihilism.

For if it's analysis of Samsara (the cycle of suffering driven by aversion, clinging, and misperception)  and Dukkha (how all conditional phenomenon/impermanent things are unreliable for happiness and dependence) was correct, and yet, thanks to modern science, where we know that there is no supernatural phenomenon, and so there is no rebirth nor nirvana, why not then kill ourselves if the ultimate goal of such a religion, as it seemed to me, was renunciation of the material world?

Oh sure there was compassion in staying back and helping others break free from the cycle of rebirth, but then the goal was still the same, rejection of being here (I understand Mahayana had a change in perception with it's Samsara is Nirvana and Bodhisattva ideal, however it's compassion was ringed with supernatural salvationism and faith in order for it to become the Greater Vehicle, almost like Catholicism idolatry vs Christ's asceticism) .

Furthermore, the Buddha himself was often portrayed as a superhuman figure, and yet he did some odd things like: [Encouraging a man to abandon his family](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/ud/ud.1.08.than.html), [telling his followers to treat food like eating a child's flesh](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.063.than.html), and [accidentally convincing a group of monks to kill themselves](https://www.wisdomlib.org/buddhism/book/vinaya-pitaka-1-bhikkhu-vibhanga/d/doc227270.html). He also only allowed women in later into his order, with far more rules and deference to their male colleagues. He wasn't perfect, yet the religious trappings around his renunciation oriented teachings didn't help. It fueled my pessimism. I didn't fully understand.

**Recently however,** through self reflection due to personal guilt, I was finally starting to break free from my negative thought cycles, and Stoicism was like a lightening bolt that finally pushed me through, all starting with Enchiridion's beautiful opening statement:

*There are things which are within our power, and there are things which are beyond our power. Within our power are opinion, aim, desire, aversion, and, in one word, whatever affairs are our own. Beyond our power are body, property, reputation, office, and, in one word, whatever are not properly our own affairs.*

This gave me the jolt to finally understand it wasn't the circumstances that condemned us, but our character. I had to take self responsibility.

**This was basically what Buddhism was saying this whole time.**

The side of Buddhism I neglected to explore during my nihilism was it's focus on Karmic responsibility. It's redefinition, in it's Hindu context, of Good and Bad not being caste, actions, or birth, but intentions and character (The Upanishads, with their similar sentiments, were also being expanded upon in this similar time-frame).

This was true even with the no-self doctrine, which could either be a technique for realizing what's not in your control (not-self: this is not me, this is not I, this is not mine, to all impermanent phenomenon including internal changes like states of consciousness or thoughts) or realizing there is no true self/eternal self (ala Hinduism), but an impermanent, multi-faceted (dependent arising, when this, that. When up, down, etc), process (no-self).

It said this same truth of the dichotomy of control from a different, more grimy angle:

*Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of suffering: birth is suffering, aging is suffering, illness is suffering, death is suffering;* ***union with what is displeasing is suffering; separation from what is pleasing is suffering; not to get what one wants is suffering***; in brief, the [*five aggregates*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skandha) *subject to clinging are suffering.*

*Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the origin of suffering: it is this* ***craving*** *\[*[*taṇhā*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta%E1%B9%87h%C4%81)*, ""thirst""\] which* [*leads to re-becoming*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Nid%C4%81nas)*, accompanied by delight and lust,* ***seeking delight here and there***; that is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for becoming, craving for disbecoming.

*Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering: it is the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving, the giving up and relinquishing of it, freedom from it,* ***non-reliance on it.***

*Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering: it is this noble eightfold path; that is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.*[*\[web 9\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Noble_Truths#cite_note-BB-71)

Essentially, going back to Stoicism's core statement, Stoicism reinforces and focuses on what's in our control (Virtue), while Buddhism focuses on what's not in our control and letting go (Dukkha/Externals). Both, of course, talk about both parts of the statement, but have a more extensive focus on one side or the other. Both encourage and lead to ethical character and sage like/arahant like inner peace, but both grasp it from a different angle (and have different metaphysical aesthetics/technical details, of course).

**And, so, in summary:**

If you are miserably drunk on life (caught up in the chasing of and running from externals and narratives of hope and desire and fear), study Buddhism, it will tear it all up and bring you down into the grimy real.

If you are miserably sober on life (pessimistic, fatalistic, fearful, depressed, think nothing is within your control and life already sucks and not worth the effort) then study Stoicism, it'll give you the kick in the ass you need to see that you do still have power, the power to improve and take responsibility, that your dignity comes from within, not without.",Stoicism,1587559381.0,t3_g60ff9,0.98,1570

Came to a hilarious stoic realization this morning,"Every night I write my to do list for the next day.

 It usually starts with : Wake at X time, etc, etc. It makes me more productive. 

The past few days I've been a bit sick, and I'm making sure to rest a lot and I have a lot of extra time since I'm self quarantining, can't train, etc. So, I'm waking up whenever I want to.  

So I write down : Wake Whenever .

I love checking things off of my to do list, and, it's become a habit. I check off, wake at 6am to go run, because, well, it's a hard thing to do. It makes me happy when I am able to check off something like that.
So, by habit, I checked off, ""wake whenever"" today, then stopped and said, well, that's not an achievement isn't it? My mood darkened a bit. But then I lightened up! But, I did wake up right? Im not dead. I made it through this night! I have an extra day! Wow! 
That's awesome!

"The point is not to control your emotions, but to not let your emotions control you.","The problem is when it comes to negative emotions people tend to try to control them. Perhaps act like they aren't there or trying to push them away. But this is counter productive. There is a noticeable difference between controlling something or not letting it control you.

(Insert hypothetical situation here). But for something relatable say you are mad about something that just happened, for instance, you didn't get the job you applied for. You feel mad, but don't want to, understandable. At this point you have a choice. 
1. You give into your feelings and just be mad, but since we're on r/stoicism that won't cut it.
2. You try to control your emotions by telling yourself; 'Hey I'm not mad, I just think I'm mad but I'm really not so I just won't be mad about it.
3. You accept that your mad, you feel that your mad, but know that this madness doesn't mean your whole day or week or life is ruined.

Now the big difference is that when you try to control your emotions you will eventually live in some kind of denial. You will still feel mad but just put a smile on while you are still feeling mad inside. It is still controlling you. The trick is to see the feeling you're having not as something that dictates the way you behave. You can be mad and just go about your day. You can still cook dinner while you're mad. You can still apply for a new job while you're mad. 

When you start to feel your emotions are not controlling you, you will become much more stable and free. When you try to control your emotions you will eventually be controlled by them. Putting a smile on while you're sad or angry still means you are being controlled by your emotions.",Stoicism,1617710057.0,t3_ml9vwt,0.99,1538

*Natural and necessary pleasures are the ones we should always seek, because they are easily satisfied. Having these alone is enough for peace of mind, a highly valued good in Epicureanism. These include the necessities of life such as eating, drinking, sleeping, shelter, social interaction, etc.*

*Natural but unnecessary pleasures include sex, having children, or being held in high esteem by others. These aren’t needed for happiness, and we should avoid pursuing these too much to avoid suffering and not overcomplicate things.*

*And to dispel the myth of the Epicureans as self-indulgent hedonists: There are unnatural and unnecessary pleasures, which are difficult to attain and include the usual vices of alcohol and excessive sexual pleasures. Epicureanism teaches that we should always avoid these. Epicurus warned, regarding these last two categories, “He who is not satisfied with a little, is satisfied with nothing.”*

"""We are to the universe as bacteria are to us."" How reminding ourselves of our smallness can help us deal with hardships","A few days ago I was walking through a heath when I stumbled upon a foresty patch. Those aren't rare in the heath near my home, there are lots of trees and small pieces of forest scattered throughout the bushland, but this patch of trees was different. Most trees in the heath are wide with low branches; oaks and alders. These trees were different. I'm not an expert on trees or anything, but I'm quite certain those were some type of fir. Tall with a barren bottom, the first branches appeared meters above me. 

I looked up, and the trees continued to go up and up, most likely continuing past the canopy I couldn't possibly see through. I felt small. I felt insignificant. I felt as if I was but a speck in the universe. These trees stood there before I was born, and will continue to stand there long after my death. There's nothing I could possibly do to the trees. I could run into them at full force and they would not even notice. 

I looked down, and below me, I saw a long caravan of ants. They walked in a long line, carrying food, cut in parts so small I couldn't identify what it used to be. None of these ants were alive three months ago and none will be alive three months from now. I probably stepped on a few of them while walking here, and I did not care. 

Then it struck me. I am to the trees as the ants are to me, and I am to the ants what the trees are to me. As above, so below. We are all ants.

And do I believe an ant's feelings are important? Imagine an ant saying ""I am sad because my head has the wrong shape. I am sad because I am 5% smaller than the other ants. I am sad because another ant I know got stepped on.""

We would say that that's ridiculous. I mean, it's an ant. Why would an ant care about being uglier or smaller or poorer than the other ants? Its life is short and insignificant.

Now, whenever I encounter hardships, I try to see it from a bird's eye view. I try to zoom out, I imagine seeing myself from the sky. In the grand scheme of things, I am just as insignificant as an ant, and there is no reason to believe me being sad or angry matters. I try to live life with as much happiness as I can, but I do not believe struggle or pain is necessarily bad, because it is only temporary.",Stoicism,1611665297.0,t3_l5dbiy,0.99,1496

Its easy to be stoic when everything is going good in life.,"I’ve (23M) been practicing stoicism for the past year or so. The meditations that stoic philosophers provide have really opened my mind to dealing with adversity, but in the past year nothing has really been bad in my life. I’m young, healthy, have a job, college degree, food shelter etc... 

Stoicism gets me through the menial bullshit of everyday life: abrasive coworkers/bosses, workouts,college, but never have I practiced stoicism to get through hard struggles... until now  and it’s starting to not work as effectively

My pet recently ran away because of a careless roommate leaving the gate open. It’s been two days and he hasn’t turned up. I’ve lost hope, I’m devastated, depressed, can’t get up or go to bed. And it’s gotten me thinking: it’s easy to be stoic when the worst thing we have to deal with trivial nonsense. But when a friend or family dies, when you get diagnosed with cancer, when it feels like the world is crumbling around you, how do you get through it? I’m trying hard but I still end up being depressed over losing my dog.

Turning 21 tomorrow and I just want to leave you all with something that really inspired me last night.,"I was watching Rewind last night, It is a documentary that came out this year about a young boy who was sexually abused by 3 different men from when he was between the age of 4-7 years old.

There is a sobering moment in the movie towards the end where the boy must testify against his uncle who is a powerful religious man in New York City, who has high paying lawyers trying their very best to tear down the credibility of this boy. 

The boy's psychiatrist was in tears telling the story of how the boy testified in court about his abuser and how bravely he fought in the face of injustice.

And after a lengthy trial due to an unlimited supply of charitable donations to his abuser, the boy decided to take the abuser's plea deal which in turn resulted in 0 time being served in prison.

Now bear with me because this is the part I want to get at.

&#x200B;

The boy who is now 30,  is talking to the psychiatrist about the trial which had been years ago, and he says something along the lines of ""why are you so proud of that moment, we lost? 

The psychiatrist said, ""Because I have never seen someone handle a situation like that, where lawyers were cross-examining you, and trying to tear away at your spirit, and your bravery being able to recount in painstaking detail what had occurred to you over those years shined so bright.""

&#x200B;

I am 21 tomorrow, I may not win the battles in my way and I certainly have not won all the battles in my past, but I will make sure my ethics and principles will shine through like the light of that brave boy through every waking moment of my life. Because at the end of the day, good people do bad things and bad people sometimes do good things, but I will do everything in my power to make sure my philosophy gives me the power to deal with these people and moments.",Stoicism,1609547701.0,t3_komwou,0.98,1406

Marcus Aurelius reminds us to get out of bed!,"I needed this today, thanks Marcus!

 1. At dawn of day, when you dislike being called, have this thought ready: 'I am called to man's labour; why then do I make a difficulty if I am going out to do what I was born to do and what I was brought into the world for? Is it for this that I am fashioned, to lie in bedclothes and keep myself warm?' 'But this is more pleasant.' 'Were you born then to please yourself; in fact for feeling, not for action? Can't you see the plants, the birds, the ants, the spiders, the bees each doing his own work, helping for their part to adjust a world? And then you refuse to do a man's office and don't make haste to do what is according to your own nature.'

"""Love is giving someone the power to destroy you, and trusting them not to use it.""","**edit:** Swap the word ""destroy"" with ""hurt"". It seems a lot of you read the quote and didn't read my breakdown. Loving someone, or extending your desire towards something outside your control, risks disappointment. Especially if you have yet to get your internals right and establish a good solid Stoic foundation. Read [Enchiridion 2](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0557,002:2:2). That doesn't mean we don't love things, it means we should be cautious doing so. To those of you who did read the whole thing, you brought up some fantastic counterpoints, and I appreciate you :) This was just some musings at work, I didn't sit on it as much as I should before posting. Definitely didn't expect this to explode as much as it did.

*I have no idea where this quote is from. I've seen it attributed to Johnny Depp, John Lennon, and even Spongebob. If someone knows where it's from, lmk and I'll update it.*

I saw this quote as a kid and it always stuck with me. As I grew older and I realized that my mother had raised me as a Stoic without knowing what that was, I realized that was the reason the quote resonated with me so well. Since I posted [my story](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/e4fh6e/my_two_year_journey_so_far/) here about a year ago and have since been open about my situation with people asking for help, several of you have reached out and we've had absolutely fantastic discussions about how love meshes with Stoicism. I thought I'd kinda compile it into a post and share with the rest of the sub.

**Love is an external, like anything else.** Thus the above quote can be altered to ""\[Loving something\] is giving \[it\] the power to destroy you, and \[hoping it doesn't\]."" Epictetus says that if you choose to care about something that is outside our control, you are making yourself a slave to the one who does control it ^(Enchiridion 1 and 14). When you love something as a Stoic, you need to accept that it is temporary, flawed, and ultimately out of your control. The time to have this conversation with yourself is now; mentally prepare yourself for losing what it is that you love. Run through the simulations in your head. Have a contingency plan. **Not because losing them is inevitable, but simply because it is possible**. Otherwise you are giving a part of yourself to someone for them to roll the dice with. And ""If a person gave your body to any stranger he met on his way, you would certainly be angry. And do you feel no shame in handing over your own mind to be confused and mystified by anyone who happens to \[hurt\] you?""^(Enchiridion 28)

**This does not mean don't love or chase externals, just like Stoicism in general doesn't mean don't care about the future**. By all means, strive for your best life and live it to the fullest. Just know that in choosing to do so, you need to likewise choose to be cognizant of the inherent risk and prepare yourself for the possibility that it will bite you in the ass. Everything is a choice, and nothing is gained for nothing.

"""You should listen to your emotions, but not necessarily agree with them""","I thought about this earlier while mediating. The way I see it, you should treat your emotions like a close observer whose judgment is of great benefit, but at the end of the day, you should also be in control of your own decisions. For example, say you are afraid. It is a good thing that you've been warned of that fear and you should accept it and pay attention to it. But maybe your reasoning determines that you should act anyway, because sometimes you have to act, even with fear. Other times, you decide that your fear is justified and that avoiding the situation in place is of greater benefit.

Always Remember The Four Stoic Virtues,"We have control over how we approach things, rather than imagining a perfect world – a utopia – the Stoic practices realism and deals with the world as it is - no strings attached, while pursuing one’s personal development through the four fundamental virtues:

**Wisdom**: understand the world without prejudice, logically and calmly

**Courage**: facing daily challenges and struggles with no complaints

**Justice**: treating others fairly even when they have done wrong

**Temperance**: which is voluntary self-restraint or moderation – where an individual refrains from doing something by sheer will power

Girlfriend of 2 years confessed & broke up with me,"My girlfriend of 2 years whom I shared many great memories with came out to me as lesbian and broke up with me a week ago. 

We broke up over the phone and it goes without saying - it was tough. 

I've dabbled with stoicism and stoic principles in the past and conveniently, only recently picked it back up; It's as if the universe was preparing me for this very moment.

I was confused and devastated.

""I don't know how else to say this but, I like women.""

 Every part of my being wanted to break down and feel hopeless. Then suddenly, I had a eureka moment amidst the storm in which I reminded myself of the wonderful philosophy known as stoicism. 

""That's okay."" I replied

""Thank you for giving me the opportunity to love you, I hope you live a good life.""

Within seconds I reminded myself that this would eventually happen and that there is nothing I can do within my control that will change the present situation, Instead I can save my dignity and act out of principle and not emotion. 

It's been a week now and I am at peace. I remind myself everyday that anything in life such as relationships, depressive periods and good days are ephemeral and we should never attach to anything.

""This too, shall pass.""

My girlfriend is a Stoic person and today she told me something which left me dumbstruck.,"I'm a pretty emotional person. And since I'm dealing with some mental illnesses too my emotions tend to be quite intense. Often I react in a disproportionate way compared to the situation. Or I might not react at the appropriate time. I'm emotionally unstable but I'm also very, like, very unsure of myself. I don't believe a word that I say and I hate myself. When people are socially dominant around me and are telling things as they are I panic. I get defensive. And when I'm engaging in a debate with my girlfriend probably 80 percent of the time I end up  whimpering about how she should stop *‘thinking she's right all the time.’* Our intellectual  discussions would devolve into me lecturing her about her tone of voice. Arguments over who is wrong and who is right would end abruptly as I will suddenly declare that the truth of the matter is forever hidden somewhere inside a murky *“grey area,”* and therefore the entire conversation has been a pointless waste of time.

I know I'm a toxic person but she has so much patience with me and today she explained me in a calm and tender manner why she is so dominant and confident in a debate or in any social situation appealing to her Stoic philosophy. 

*She said that she always lived by the philosophy that she should only speak when she's got something to say, and she should only say what she believes to be true, and she should say what she believes to be true with a passion that reveals the certainty with which she believes it.*

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8b6-8EGdiw) is a 14 minute talk on anger by Donald Robertson. (Quotes are from the video, and just one aspect of anger that he talks about.) An excellent talk, IMHO.

I am convinced that anger is almost never of any benefit. And those few times when there might be something beneficial from anger, there are always alternatives that offer even better benefits. I still occasionally get angry and when I do I try my best to find something that can justify my anger. I'll let you know if I ever find such a thing.

Robertson says Marcus Aurelius mentions 10 different ways to deal with anger. Robertson points out the more popular technique of reminding ourselves that **it is not things that upset us but our opinions about those things**. This is my main go to mantra when I feel that shot of adrenalin being released in my blood stream - warm face, increased heart beat, deeper breathes. I also remind myself that it is not a saber tooth tiger about to kill and eat me but instead, for example, it is just someone who said I was wrong about something.

I Completed 60 Days of Meditation for 1 Hour/day and it cut my Anxiety away. I'm Now Making an App.," I recently completed Naval Ravikant's recommended 60 days of meditation for 1 hour per day. I tried meditating before this for around 20/30 mins but never really felt that much benefit. So I started doing 1 hr. I tweeted about each day which kept me accountable and committed each day.

At first it was very difficult to sit still for that long. But after the first week, I started to truly realise that all of my problems were in my own head. I was perceiving things poorly, from past images that I'd clung onto.

Reading wisdom from the main 3 stoic philosophers, Jiddu Krishnamurti and Naval Ravikant each day also helped to rewire my mind, giving me useful stuff to meditate on. I now realise that living in the past causes depression and living in the future causes anxiety. Discovering for myself that this is true makes me almost unconsciously stay present - and I feel much better for it.

I am currently learning to code and as a practice project I'm making a meditation app that I plan on using myself. It's going to be based on doing 60 days of meditation, 1 hr/day. At the beginning, only day 1 is unlocked. After meditating for a full hour, the next day is unlocked. Each day has some advice/quotes from the philosophers I mentioned before.

I made this post on the meditation forum and had a surprising amount of interest so thought I'd ask if anybody on here would be interested in using this, I'm thinking of putting it on the app store? :)",Stoicism,1596275297.0,t3_i1por3,0.95,1294
Stoic exercises that have turned my life around,"# Introduction

A couple of weeks ago, I wrote [a lengthy article](https://projectimpero.com/2019/11/08/stoic-manual/) on **seven of the most effective exercises** that I have taken from the Stoics, with a few ideas on how to implement them. It's no secret that Stoic ethics can be surprisingly pragmatic, so I thought it would be good to capitalize on them. For the sake of brevity and convenience, let me sum up **three** of them right below:

# 1 - Premeditatio Malorum

If you're in this subreddit, chances are you already know about this one. It's probably the most famous of all. For that reason, I won't dive deep into its theory here.

In a nutshell, though, the exercise consists in **willingly anticipating scenarios of misfortune**. Research shows that our brains have a hard time differentiating between real-life experiences and imagined ones, so it's no wonder that this practice works so well (I theorize that it has a similar function than nightmares do in terms of evolution). This ""premeditated pessimism"" is useful for three main reasons:

* a) It helps you **plan in advance** (any good strategist knows to take the worst-case scenarios seriously)
* b) It increases **mental toughness** (by softening the emotional toll things will take on you)
* c) It will make you **happier** (by stopping your constant hedonic adaptation)

We can go about implementing the practice of Premeditatio Malorum in two main ways:

The first is what I would call **""short bursts"" of premeditation**. This is a more shallow approach that values frequency of practice over intensity. For instance, as the typical example goes, a husband could consider that the kiss he gives to his wife every morning before leaving to the office could be the last. He is not supposed to sit with the thought and actually dive into it, but just to simply contemplate for a second that this is a possibility — **because it is**. Not only will this make the kiss be more genuine and deliberate, it will also make sure he finds a deeper joy in seeing his wife again later that day — something which he usually takes for granted. In this case, even if the very worst happened (i.e. his wife did pass away unexpectedly)  he could at least find some comfort in knowing that **he made the best out of the time they had together**, and he will be less crushed by the unexpectedness of it all.

The second method is analogous to a **meditation session**. Contrary to the first, this one values intensity over frequency. Rather than randomly coming up with reminders throughout the day, it consists in willingly setting some time aside every week to face one particular fear that troubles your mind. In the article, I give the example of how I dealt with a periodic anxiety I had about the possible death of my father. In summary, I dealt with it by willingly facing the worst-case scenario, in total detail, for about 30 minutes one day. I went into my room, turned off the lights and looked at that creeping fear right in the eyes. To my surprise, as the tears started to flow, I realized that my anxiety was simply an unhealthy sublimation of a deep-rooted love, care and respect for my father. By **willingly switching the script** and visualizing my nightmare, I went from its victim to its adversary and, eventually, to its friend.

# 2 - Mourning Pages

(Nope, that's not a typo, it's spelled with a ""u"" for a reason)

If there is one philosophy that takes not complaining seriously, it's Stoicism. Marcus Aurelius wrote:

>*“Everything that happens is either endurable or not. If it’s endurable, then endure it. Stop complaining. If it’s unendurable… then stop complaining. Your destruction will mean its end as well.”*  
>  
>Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

In other words, if you can endure it, **stop complaining**. If you can’t endure it, **stop complaining**. It’s that simple.

Exercising your ability to stop complaining can be quite tricky, but the exercise of Mourning Pages has worked wonderfully for me. It's not explicitly Stoic (it was invented by a modern writer) but it's undeniably Stoic. Let me explain.

Every morning, you are supposed to sit down for a few minutes every morning and **unload the petty, whiny, constant chatter of your mind onto a page** — without thinking too much. You simply grab pen and paper and write whatever is on your mind. It doesn’t have to be artsy; it doesn’t have to be well-written; it doesn’t even have to make sense. In fact, the less artsy, well-written and structured it is — **the better**.

The benefits of the exercise are threefold. First, it will **quieten your mind**. Julia Cameron (who invented the exercise) explains that it’s as though you had vacuumed the corners of your consciousness with a dust buster. This newfound mental silence will, in turn, allow you to **become more creative** (that’s the reason why she came up with the exercise in the first place). Finally, it will also allow you to become acquainted with the **dark parts of your psyche**.

This, it seems to be, is somewhat similar to what Marcus Aurelius himself was doing. As professor Michael Sugrue put it in his famous lecture, Marcus would have probably been ashamed if he had known that we read his personal journal. After all, it was his main way to vent: to tell himself that he is going to meet incompetent people, to remind himself to keep his cool, to let his whiny inner-voice get some time to unload itself.

Implementing this exercise is quite straightforward:

Every morning after waking up, instead of grabbing a trendy *Gratefulness Journal* or reciting *affirmations*, you are going to grab your **Petty Journal**. Then, your only goal will be to pour 2 to 3 pages of thoughtless writing onto the page. It’s important that you **do not think too much**, for that will cut the stream of cloudy consciousness that we are trying to run dry.

What’s beautiful about doing this practice in the morning is that it will empty your *“complaining quota”* for the rest of the day. Once you reach those 2 to 3 pages of writing and close your diary, **it’s over**. You’ve already whined, you’ve already been annoying on paper. You’ve probably said things you don’t actually mean — and that’s perfectly fine. This exercise is so powerful that its author described that they should be called Mourning Pages, with a ""u"", because:

>*“\[Mourning Pages\] are really a farewell to life as you knew it; and an introduction to life as it’s going to be.”*  
>  
>Julia B. Cameron

# 3 - Practicing Poverty

Similarly to the first exercise, this one is quite famous. I don't think many people realize *how* famous it is, though. The practice of poverty has been around for ages, and even modern individuals like Elon Musk have put it to work. The man willingly lived with $30 USD for food for a month, to see if he could survive the financial hardships of entrepreneurship. After surviving by eating mostly oranges and hot dogs, he reflected on the experiment and said that, if he could live for a dollar a day for food, **he would be okay no matter what**.

The benefits of practicing poverty are quite intuitive.

First of all, willingly practicing poverty is the perfect way to, well, **save money**. Rather than framing your goal as *“I need to stop spending so much money”* consider switching it to something more like *“I’m going to practice poverty when it comes to X or Y”* — this way you’ll be framing a boring burden into a motivating challenge.

Secondly, as Seneca points out in his letter (more on this in the article), it will also help you **become more grateful** for your regular non-poor meals (yes, this is a recurring theme).

Finally, from a neuroscientific perspective, lowering your dopamine levels will help you reset your dopaminergic basal activation level to a more sensitive one. In other words: it will make coming back to non-poor habits **feel better than ever**.

There are countless ways in which you could implement this exercise, but here are some main ideas:

You can get pretty creative with it: forcing yourself to use **public transport** instead of driving/taxi/uber; switching to **cheaper household** products for a while; dressing in **simpler and cheaper clothes**; **turning off your heating** for a week, **sleeping on the floor** instead of your bed… you name it. If you’re looking for a bigger challenge you could even try ~~sleeping at your local shelter for a weekend~~ *(Edit: as* u/hiraethora *pointed out, this might not be a a great idea. If you decide to do it, make sure you are not denying resources to any of the residents; similarly, consider making a donation to both compensate for your trouble and help their charitable services prosper)* or live one night as a homeless person (sounds hardcore, but it’s actually not that uncommon among people who enjoy backpacking).

The most obvious and straightforward way to willingly practice poverty, however, is by deciding to **eat plain food** for a certain period of time. Perhaps you could eat rice and beans for a whole week/month or save up all the extra money you spend on pastries and sugary goodies. Or both.

The Spartans, after all, were famous for eating ""black soup"" on a daily basis — a disgusting dish made of boiled pigs’ legs, blood, salt and vinegar. Spartan soldiers (which by the way were actually quite well-off) ate this day-in and day-out. According to legend, a man from a city called Sybaris, famous for its absolute luxury and gluttony —which is where the term sybarite comes from— once tasted the Spartan black broth and famously said:

>*“Now I know why the Spartans do not fear death.”*

Obviously, you don't have to go that far... but you get the idea.

# Conclusion

If you are new to Stoicism and have enjoyed reading about these, then I encourage you to check out the article and learn about them in detail, as well as 4 other different practices. These exercises are extremely effective tools for a very specific job: building up your inner Stoic. Trying to use them all at once will most likely not be sustainable. Instead, I recommend that you pick a few of them and integrate them into the next 30 days, as if it were a challenge. As the days go by, try to get a feel for them and don’t be scared to make adjustments.

I would love to discuss them all with you guys, and hear about any interesting new exercises that you might have come up with.

"‘If God had entrusted an orphan to your care, would you have neglected him in such a fashion (as you neglect yourself)?’ - Epictetus","“The Athena of Phidias, once she has stretched out her hand to receive the Victory upon it, remains fixed in that attitude for ever, whereas the works of the gods move and breathe, and are capable of making use of impressions and passing judgements about them. [21] When you yourself are the work of such a maker, will you dishonour him? Not only has he created you, but he has also entrusted you to your own sole charge, [22] and yet will you not only fail to remember that, but also dishonour the charge that he has entrusted to you? If God had entrusted an orphan to your care, would you have neglected him in such a fashion? [23] Yet he has delivered you yourself into your own keeping, and says, ‘I had no one in whom I could put more confidence than you. Keep this person as he was born by nature to be; keep him modest, trustworthy, high-minded, unshakeable, free from passion, imperturbable.’ And after that, don’t you want to keep him so?”

This section to me speaks a great a deal about the importance of caring for oneself as if you were someone you are responsible for. I first noticed this after discovering the lectures of Jordan Peterson. I noticed that I would care more for those that I’m responsible for than I would myself. This made no sense since I, as Seneca says, love myself more than I love others. Yet here I was neglecting myself. Having learned this, I’ve put it into practice.

"“Don’t be ashamed to need help. Like a soldier storming a wall, you have a mission to accomplish. And if you’ve been wounded and you need a comrade to pull you up? So what?” Marcus Aurelius (Meditations, Book 7, Section 7)","“Don’t be ashamed to need help. Like a soldier storming a wall, you have a mission to accomplish. And if you’ve been wounded and you need a comrade to pull you up? So what?” Marcus Aurelius (Meditations, Book 7, Section 7)

                One of the issues I’ve dealt with the most in my life is thinking that I need to go it alone. But where has trying to be an island gotten me? The teachers in my life have taught me, the leaders in my life have led me, and my friends and family have loved me.

                Everyone needs help from time to time, and learning when to ask for it can be one of the hardest things a person can do. Marcus Aurelius one of Rome’s greatest Emperors stated himself, “Don’t be ashamed to need help. Like a soldier storming a wall, you have a mission to accomplish. And if you’ve been wounded and you need a comrade to pull you up? So what?”

                The question, “So what?” has always stuck with me. Your ego is usually the culprit when you fail to ask for help. Not wanting to look weak, foolish, or like an idiot. So, whenever you’re afraid to ask for help remember, “So what?”. So, what you asked for help? If you need it, then ask. Because from a former Soldier I asked for help for times than I could count, and each time I was thankful for the helping hand.

Stop living in your head,"   
  Most of the people that you encounter walking alone on the streets are living in their head. They reduce their perception to things that catch their absolute attention and/or trigger their survival instincts aka things that could harm them (passing cars, cyclists, individuals they consider as weird or beautiful). We could say that when an individual is going from point A to point B he spends 15% of his time looking at and percieving things and 85% living in his head and thinking. 

  
  *Thinking in it's natural form is the foundation of ourselves* 

  
  Now, thinking also got it's negative aspects if you use it falsly. If you think too much about a topic you will eventually end up with negative thoughts since you're stressing your brain out (Overthinking) It also reduces your perception emotionally and exteriorly (tunnel vision), the resulting consequences can be seen as ''lost opportunities'' since you walk past a lot of things that could've potentially catched your attention but didn't since you only accord your perception to things that fall under the ''absolute attention'' and ''survival instict'' category.  

 These ''lost opportunities'' are basically moments where you could've gathered exterior information in order to gain additional knowledge and experiences.   
  When you grow up you are basically getting bombarded with exterior informations in order to learn and survive. At a certain age, let's say 20, you already learned and experienced quite some things, you got your foundation. The years pass and you learn/experience some new things, you got your life together and feel like you accomplished something, yet, there is something that just feels off. 

  
  *Some people never leave that stage*   

  
  This feeling of something being not right mostly comes from the the fact that your interior informations are processed over and over, and that there aren't enough exterior informations comming in in order to create a variety of topics to think about. Since our brain never stops thinking and analyzing it would only be in our intrest to add some informatial variety in order to prevent our thoughts to get sour. 

  
  Sour thoughts: Our thoughts get sour when we think about them too often and/or end up with unfinished thoughts or unclear emotions about a specific topic/thought. 

  
  *Constantly living in your head is unhealthy in a lot of aspects* 

  
  In order to add variety to your thoughts you should try to open your whole FOV (field of vision) in various moments of the day in order to percieve the world that sourrounds you, this creates an automatic absence of deep thoughts which translates to deep exterior awareness which is essential for an eased state of mind. 

  
  To express it in a much simpler form:   

  
  You have to stop to constantly live in your head, open your eyes, pay attention to small details that surround you on your path. 

  
  *Live in the moment, observe without judging*

"With the loss of faith in my religion, “Meditations” essentially became my replacement for the Bible.","I was a fundamentalist, southern-baptist Christian. Fully believed every word in the Bible, and it was my source of hope and my purpose in life. You can imagine what happened when I lost my faith at 19.

Nietzsche talked about the removal of religion and the harm it can do, stating its not the absence of religion that leads people to despair, it’s the withdrawal of it. Losing my faith flipped my worldview on its head. I was completely lost and had no idea where to turn. Everything my life was based on was swept out from under me.

It took a toll on me; I fell into depression and battled it throughout my freshman year of college. Soon after, though, I found philosophy. The first branch I heard of was stoicism. Desperate for something, I was recommended “meditations”, and I picked it up right away.

Oh, man. The first two chapters blew me away. I remember tears of joy from the words I was reading. In a world where previously I was taught that I’m “worthless” and “nothing” without god, Marcus Aurelius gave me guidance. It was the guidance I had before, but without the dogma; it felt real. That was over a year ago, and since then I’ve learned to come to peace with my existence, but the peace that I felt while reading Meditations is something I will never forget.

Edit: thank you everyone for the words. I’m glad people can relate and it makes me happy I’m not alone.

The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury.,"This quote from Aurelius in Meditations has really stuck with me in the last few days.

Recently, a close friend of mine has decided to lash out, be cold, say horrible things about me behind my back and attempt to ruin my reputation in our tight knit friend group for reasons unbeknownst to me.

I have remained silent throughout the entire thing. Any time someone brings her up, or asks what happened, I only reply with I wish her the best and have nothing negative to say about her, or say nothing at all.
It’s amazing how much happier and at peace I feel lately to mind my own business and not get involved in any drama. A few years ago, before being introduced to stoic philosophy, this would have gone much uglier.

I have quickly learned how much power is in utter silence.

Edit to add: I don’t necessarily view this as revenge. I don’t want to get revenge, because I genuinely care about her as a person and want the best for her; despite how immensely disappointed I was. I am more or less proud of how far I’ve come in this stoic journey of mine- since 2 years ago I know I absolutely would have sought revenge on her in an ugly manner for doing this.

Stoicism is about controlling your reactions instead of having no reactions at all.,"It seems like many people think stoicism means not doing or saying anything at all whenever someone insults you.

Its true that nothing can harm you if you dont think that it harms you.

So some people who wanna practise stoicism just stay quiet and let other people do as they please. They allow others to humiliate them infront of others or give in in important matters.

But its also true that the obstacle on the way becomes the way.

That means that whenever you encouter a situation where someone is trying to humiliate you or attack you, its an opportunity to practise certain virtues.

If someone is shouting at you

1. Check your reaction

2. Ask yourself: What is the antidote for this? ( Think in terms of Fire-Water )

3. React in the proper way. Usually calm but also just.

TIL that Marcus Aurelius died in a pandemic that lasted 14 years.,"His writings in ""Meditations"" take on a deeper meaning given that context! \*mind blown\* The epidemic also lasted \_14 years\_ across two different waves. Talk about dealing through tough times as a ruler...

All I can say is, I'm so thankful his writings are still accessible today.

&#x200B;

Marcus' last words:

>“**Weep not for me; think rather of the pestilence and the deaths of so many others**.”

So sad to think how world leadership went from that to what we have today...

"""The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane"" ~ Marcus Aurelius","Where does it come from? When searching, it's commonly attributed to ""Meditations"", but I can't find it there.

Anybody knows where is it exactly? I would like to see it in context.

**After edit: TLDR:**

>!This text is a result of multiple translations: Greek -> French -> Russian -> Russian (quote) -> English. The original corresponding text is ""Meditations"" but I was said by Epictetus!<

**Edit:**

Found it in the work of [Recollections And Essays by LEO TOLSTOY](https://archive.org/stream/recollectionsand035475mbp/recollectionsand035475mbp_djvu.txt)

Although I cannot find info about where it was taken from, any ideas? Maybe some Russian speaking people can help find it you in the original work from Tolstoy?

**Edit 2**: [Asked on Russian literature subredit](https://www.reddit.com/r/RussianLiterature/comments/mlz61s/need_help_with_finding_original_text_of/)

It was indeed written in the [original text from Leo Tolstoy](https://www.reddit.com/r/RussianLiterature/comments/mlz61s/need_help_with_finding_original_text_of/gtouxh1?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (thank's to [u/ComradeCatilina](https://www.reddit.com/u/ComradeCatilina/)), see: [https://www.prlib.ru/item/394311](https://www.prlib.ru/item/394311) (p. 33-34 of the scan)

So it's not a problem of the english translation contrary to [what  wikiquote says](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/mlyeyq/the_object_of_life_is_not_to_be_on_the_side_of/gto6g2e?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) .

In (modern) Russian the quote is like this: Задача жизни не в том, чтобы быть на стороне большинства, а в том, чтобы не попасть в ряды умалишённых

It does not point unfortunately to the sources, so I don't know where the citation is from.

**Edit 3:** Thanks to u/mahendrabirbikram I have found out that Leo Tolstoy probably took it from [russian translation of Meditations (Марк Аврелий. Размышления. Перевод князя XI:24, p.168)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/%D0%9C%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BA_%D0%90%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B9._%D0%A0%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%BC%D1%8B%D1%88%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F._%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4_%D0%BA%D0%BD%D1%8F%D0%B7%D1%8F_%D0%9B._%D0%A3%D1%80%D1%83%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0_%281882%29.pdf?uselang=ru) .

Which corresponds roughly to:

>XXXI. 'Of the free will there is no thief or robber:' out of Epictetus; Whose is this also: that we should find a certain art and method of assenting; and that we should always observe with great care and heed the inclinations of our minds, that they may always be with their due restraint and reservation, always charitable, and according to the true worth of every present object. And as for earnest longing, that we should altogether avoid it: and to use averseness in those things only, that wholly depend of our own wills. It is not about ordinary petty matters, believe it, that all our strife and contention is, but whether, with the vulgar, we should be mad, or by the help of philosophy wise and sober, said he.

or [https://lexundria.com/m\_aur\_med/11/lg](https://lexundria.com/m_aur_med/11/lg)

>**36** No man can rob us of our free will. (Epictetus, iii. 22.)  
>  
>**37** Epictetus also said, a man must discover an art \[or rules\] with respect to giving his assent; and in respect to his movements he must be careful that they be made with regard to circumstances, that they be consistent with social interests, that they have regard to the value of the object; and as to sensual desire, he should altogether keep away from it; and as to avoidance \[aversion\] he should not show it with respect to any of the things which are not in our power.  
>  
>**38** The dispute then, he said, is not about any common matter, but about being mad or not.

So seems the exact quote is more a result of multiple translations than what actually M. Aurelius said. Looks like the russian translation used French as base. Quite fascinating!

Anybody French and can help me find it in French translations of Meditations? I found [one translation from 1803](https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Ya2fqX3YzQsC&hl=pl&pg=GBS.PA371) Pensées de l'empereur Marc-Aurele-Antonin, traduites du grec par M. de Joly.

**Edit 4:** Made a [post on translator](https://www.reddit.com/r/translator/comments/mmbyh7/old_russian_french_1800_ancient_greek_tracing/) maybe they will manage to help.

**Edit 5:** **Conclusion!**

Great thanks to u/ldiebel who [found out](https://www.reddit.com/r/translator/comments/mmbyh7/old_russian_french_1800_ancient_greek_tracing/gtqma1l?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that Russian text

>Задача жизни не в том, чтобы быть на стороне большинства, а в том, чтобы не попасть в ряды умалишённых

Comes from Τα εις εαυτον (About himself) part of Meditation and it does correspond to:

>Οὐ περὶ τοῦ τυχόντος οὖν"", ἔφη, ""ἐστὶν ὁ ἀγών, ἀλλὰ περὶ τοῦ μαίνεσθαι ἢ μή.

Which is in current translation:

>**38** The dispute then, he said, is not about any common matter, but about being mad or not.

Also great thanks to u/orvn who [pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/translator/comments/mmbyh7/old_russian_french_1800_ancient_greek_tracing/gtrmhvn?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

>Умалишённый in Russian does refer to people who have lost their mind in modern Russian. However the etymology of the word is interesting, because it's a portmanteau of ума(or разум) and лишения. Literally this means empty of sense or intelligence.  
>  
>So if a mistranslation did occur here, the original intent might have been not to refer to insanity. Rather that the goal of life is to avoid becoming one of those who does not use their mind/wit/sensibilities.

This further strengthens that this could be indeed passage **38**.

So passage **comes indeed from** **Marcus Aurelius ""Meditations"", but he was not the one who said it**. Although thought multiple translation it changed it's meaning.

**It was Epictetus**, in [the Discourses as reported by Arrian](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Epictetus,_the_Discourses_as_reported_by_Arrian,_the_Manual,_and_Fragments/Fragments):

>When you attack someone with vehemence and threatening, remember to tell yourself beforehand that you are a tame animal; and then you will never do anything fierce, and so will come to the end of your life without having to repent, or to be called to account.  
>  
>You are a little soul, carrying around a corpse, as Epictetus used to say.  
>  
>We must discover, said he, an art that deals with assent, and in the sphere of the choices we must be careful to maintain close attention, that they be made with due reservations, that they be social, and that they be according to merit; and from desire we must refrain altogether, and must exercise aversion towards none of the things that are not under our control.  
>  
>**It is no ordinary matter that is at stake, said he, but it is a question of either madness or sanity**.

Thinking like Marcus aurelius,"Me and my girlfriend broke up yesterday together for 7 months but it was genuine infatuation. She said we needed to talk so we did. She was telling me all those things such as ""falling out of love"" and that whilst crying uncontrollably. I had a foresight this was happened so I subconsciously thought, what would Marcus aurelius do? I told her ""cherish the times we've had, you need to be alone, its nature for this to happen, and you're giving me back to nature. ""
Now, today I thought : its over, we aren't compatible and nature has chosen to separate us for our own good. 

It may be hard in the coming times but I'm proud of myself for discovering stoicism and the aura of happiness given to me by seeing my friends prior to the event.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/ro5ak9/i_dont_want_to_be_this_guys_friend_but_he/

So basically a guy was just sending me memes the whole time instead of meaningful messages. I needed to know the stoic thing to do. The general advice I got was

1) why do you even care, let the memes wash over you (Stoic indeference?)

2) just block and move on (this felt cowardly and not courageous)

3) Have the courageous conversation that you don't dig this


I went with option 3. and the reason why is the four stoic virtues 

Wisdom,
Courage,
Temperance,
Justice

Here is what i sent

Hey dude, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but i sometimes find it hard to respond because you mostly send imporsonal messages about memes or covid news or seemingly random stuff.  I'm hoping we can send personal messages instead and stay away from memes, news and forwarded stuff. I think that way we can create more meaningful connections. For example yesterday was Christmas, instead of sending me a message about it you are sending a random toast video 😃


His response

Morning. Sure no problem 😎🤝🏽
I agree no more random vids and memes.

Then we went on to actually have the longest conversation we've ever had. So I'm glad I was courageous and finally stopped the bombardment of memes in my inbox. I Should have done this a year ago.

On why we shouldn't try to suppress our emotions but only control our reaction to them.,"""I did something I hadn’t done in fifteen years of oncology. I grieved with my team. How? Our team gathered together — doctors, nurses, support staff, and even administrators — and with the guidance of our social workers, we shared what we were feeling about recent patient losses. We listened to each other. We cried together. I allowed my team to see a vulnerable side of myself, the side that had been told since medical school never to show herself, or else. Or else what? Because here’s the thing, nothing bad happened. In fact, good things happened. Both social workers thanked me afterward for my candor and for “being willing to show emotion” in front of the team because, they said, it gave the rest of the team permission to show their emotions, too. Wow, I thought, does that mean before this grief session, my team didn’t think I felt the same things that they did surrounding patient loss?  

Then I realized that from our first days of medical school, doctors are conditioned to hide their emotions away; to suppress and conceal. And because I hadn’t ever spoken to my team about my grief over patient losses before, they assumed I didn’t experience it to the same degree. Suppressing these feelings kind of made me feel less than human, which is definitely not the way I want to be perceived by my team (or my patients).""

"I may have Covid 19, my stoic view.","I have ticked all the check-boxes, I wear a mask (perhaps more than necessary) wash my hands, and stay isolated save my children, mother, girlfriend, and her son. I controlled what I could. However the past few days I have had a fever, though no coughing. It may just be a mild flu, too. No less I am getting tested tomorrow.

Epictitus, and Marcus remind us over and over our bodies are not ours. They also remind us that life is short, and to keep death in mind because fortune can turn in a moment's notice. I sat on my couch last night, and used negative visualization to extrapolate the worst case. I have Covid, and I am going to die alone from it. This means that Thursday was the last time I hugged my children of 12 and 7, my house, career, car, all of it is meaningless, but this is all out of my control now.

Why die shamefully? Why show my kids that death is indignant, and that its ""not fair?"" I got 40 years! I have a strong body, have made good use of it, have touch peoples lives, and have two good kids who enjoy being with their father and learning stoic principles.

If worse comes to be, which is unlikely, I am thankful for my life and what I made if it, especially when I started down the path of stoicism several years ago. Many people live lives where they cannot say they even get several good years.

I have already accepted death a few years ago and it has made my life much richer. It keeps first things first, and I have come to value things that do not cost any money. My anxiety and stress is little, and cherishing each moment makes live very long. It also allows me not to suffer in advance, since that is suffering in excess. It is the reason I am sitting here with a pounding headache typing this, but smile at the birds dancing about my bird-feeder, while I enjoy the quietude of an early summer morning.

Anyway, Via face time, zoom, or whatever platform I will see my children if worse came to be, I will be cheerful, loving, and supportive to the very end. There is no other way to be! I have a job to do until my very last breath and will do it, this is what we are taught, this is why we practice.

I finally stopped caring about what other people think,"I was on the train standing next to these high school guys, and one of them was ordering a curry online on his phone or something which led to his friend asking him if Indians shower everyday (they are both not Indian by the way). Now, myself being Indian I kinda tensed up when he said this as we were standing quite close and I thought he was talking about me, cause even when I wear a mask I still look Indian. Then his friend started to say how Indians smell weird and in the past, I would have got very self conscious and maybe even started to cry. However, I realised that this is the perfect opportunity to practice stoicism and I realised that what they say and think about Indians and other people in general is beyond my control.

The Story of the Chinese Farmer : Alan Watts,"Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.” The farmer said, “Maybe.” The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!” The farmer again said, “Maybe.” 

The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, “Oh dear, that’s too bad,” and the farmer responded, “Maybe.” The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, “Isn’t that great!” Again, he said, “Maybe.”

***A thunderstorm appears. I can’t make it go away.***

***I notice a fearful thought.***

***But who’s in control? Me or my thought?***

***I am in control.***

***The storm does not matter; how I react to it matters.***

***Instead of trying to control the storm, I will control myself.***

***Instead of focusing on what is happening around me, I will focus on what’s happening inside me.***

"""Do not pray for easy lives, pray to be stronger men"" - John Kennedy","In life, we have things that are in our control and things that are not in our control. Things like weather, death, love we can't control, but things like our thoughts, our perspective, taking care of ourselves, are those things we can control.

So hard times are not bad. They teach us something. The deeper we go within ourselves, the more awareness we will have when a hard time comes next time. 

Next time anything happens to you, ask yourself: ""Is it something that it's in my control or not"" if you can't control it, don't worry. What you can control, it's your reaction to the situation.

My list of rules for a stoic life.,"A few years ago I wrote down two handfuls of guiding principles or rules that would give me some kind of safety rails for life, something I could turn to when I was facing the frequent uncertainty of how to act in difficult situations but also in day to day existence.

Most of what I wrote down were lessons I learned from reading Marcus and Seneca but there was also inspiration from Miyamoto Musashi's [Dokkōdō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dokkōdō) (where I got the idea to make a list) and principles of Zen Buddhism that got thrown in there.

I don’t claim to have any profound answers or that these rules are even close to the most important one should adhere to, but they have helped me tremendously and on the chance that someone else might also find value in them I thought I’d share them.

So without further ado, here's the list:

&#x200B;

1. **To dedicate your life to something, even if it lacks meaning to others.**
2. **The process is the goal, every action, however seemingly meaningless should be performed with great care. You are building your own temple, chop wood, carry water.**
3. **Nature has given you emotions so that they can be of use to you, so observe them and let only those come to the surface that are of service to you.**
4. **Take care of your body and your mind, for the body is your vessel and your mind it’s operator.**
5. **To not be roused by distressing events or by other peoples actions and treatment of you for you cannot change them. But to care deeply about how you respond and how you treat them.**
6. **To not attach yourself to material possessions and simple pleasures and to not mourn the loss of them. To be as fulfilled living in a hut as in a palace. But to also recognize that abolishing material pleasures completely is not desirable, and to enjoy them in disciplined moderation.**
7. **To be complete in yourself. To not depend on anyone for happiness or completion.**
8. **To accept and understand but not to succumb to your preconceived notions.**
9. **To recognize the potential for goodness and evil in everyone as in yourself.**
10. **If one has to think of the past or the future it should be a deliberate practice, otherwise one should not dwell on what will be or what has been and be present.**",Stoicism,1623533833.0,t3_nyh9z4,0.99,1165

And never cease sculpting your own statue, until the divine light of virtue shines within you"" (Plotinus)

Whilst Plotinus was a Neoplatonist, not a Stoic, I thought the beautiful sentiment of sculpting oneself in the imitation of virtue would resonate with many here.

The 3 Stoic Disciplines,"I’ve noticed many of the posts here have become people seeking advice or talking about their personal experiences wherein they apply Stoicism. However I see very few posts regarding the original logical dialectic, references to Stoic texts, etc. 

I seek to give people tangible and practical ways in which they can apply stoicism to their lives, and I’ll do so here by explaining the “three disciplines”.

Epictetus described a threefold division between *lived* stoic practice. 

1.	“The Discipline of Desire”, which has to do with acceptance of our fate
2.	“The Discipline of Action”, which has to do with philanthropy or love of mankind
3.	“The Discipline of Assent”, which has to do with mindfulness of our judgements

Marcus Aurelius references the disciplines a few times through *Meditations* and it’s clear he was influenced by Epictetus.

**1.	The Discipline of Desire (a.k.a. Stoic Acceptance)**

The discipline of desire is the virtue of living in accordance with Nature or the Universe as a Whole. This includes having a philosophical attitude toward life and accepting our Fate as inevitable. Fate here is not some mysterious metaphysical force of predetermination. It simply means the causal network of events that bring about subsequent events (cause and effect).

*“Seek not for events to happen as you wish but wish events to happen as they do and your life will go smoothly and serenely.”* (Enchiridion, VIII)

This does not mean be a push over or live life passively (this paradox will be explained in the discipline of action).

All in all, the discipline of desire is the calm acceptance of everything out of our immediate control; desiring to align that which is in our control with virtue, and not desiring that which is out of our control.

**2. The Discipline of Action (Stoic Philanthropy)**

According to Stoic tradition, virtue is the only good and is sufficient to live a life of fulfillment (*eudaimonia*). This discipline includes developing the four Stoic virtues and ‘taming’ the four passions. 

The IV Virtues

I. Courage - overcoming fear or aversion to what ought to be done (fortitude, bravery)
II. Temperance - overcoming attracting or desire to what ought not to be done (moderation, discipline)
III. Wisdom - knowing what ought to be done and ought to be avoided (discernment, right judgment)
IV. Justice - thought and action resulting in the common good (morality, fairness, benevolence)

The IV Passions

I. Fear - irrational aversion to something falsely judged as bad (cowardice, procrastination)
II. Craving - irrational attraction to something falsely judged as good (gluttony, greed, addiction)
III. Pain - irrational sadness over something falsely judged as bad (moping, self-pity)
IV. Elation - irrational happiness over something falsely judged as good (over-excitement, indulgence)

The discipline of action is essentially undertaking all action in harmony with our fellow humans, as well as helping them flourish (i.e. live a life of *eudaimonia*), pursing actions in accordance with the virtues and avoiding the passions. Or, at least making sure our actions don’t go *against* our virtues and the good of mankind. However, because the condition of others is out of our control, we should undertake these actions with a “reserve clause” such as “Fate permitting”, “God-willing”, etc., always remembering that our actions can be obstructed.

Hence, Marcus Aurelius appears to refer to three clauses that Stoics should be continually mindful to attach to all of their actions:

1.	That they are undertaken “with a reserve clause” (hupexairesis)
2.	That they are “for the common welfare” of mankind (koinônikai)
3.	That they “accord with value” (kat’ axian)

Value is in reference to the “preferred indifferents”. Stoics are indifferent to what is out of their control, including life and death, health and disease, etc. However, life is preferable to death, health to disease, financial stability to poverty, etc. and thus we are allowed to pursue these things “in accord with value”.

**3. The Discipline of Assent (Stoic Mindfulness)**

The discipline of assent is the virtue of living in accordance with our nature as rational beings, which means living in accord with reason and truth in our thoughts and speech. 

Assent is in reference to which thoughts or impression we agree with. It consists of monitoring our inner voice and confronting our value judgements. For instance, when we hear of a death, our inner voice may say “That is tragic”. If we give assent to this impression, then we judge the event as tragic even though it was in accordance with nature. Instead we should catch the impression and ask “Was this death truly tragic, or is it nature running its course? All things must come to an end eventually. Is that truly a tragedy?” and so on. 

“Men are not disturbed by things, but by the views which they take of things.” (Enchiridion, V)



(Although it can seem like doctrine, Stoicism is not a religion and shouldn’t be practiced dogmatically. As always, extract what you want and apply it as you wish. This is from the original Stoic teachings and thus can be modified to fit modern practice of Stoicism. God knows I don’t practice everything in this post.)",Stoicism,1617304730.0,t3_mi2rno,0.99,1157
Just realized Stoicism is perfect for dating,"What's great about Stoicism is that you learn how to value yourself, you learn how to react to your own emotions and you can't control your partner/date/hook-up's feelings...why the hell isn't Stoicism taught more in the dating scene?? Part of Stoicism is not giving a shit what other people think about you, that is a perfect principle for dating. Sometimes you get ghosted (whatever, that's her/his decision) and sometimes you're not their type (that's fine, hope he/she can find happiness with someone else). Yes it's hard, and yes it can downright be depressing when you get your heartbroken. But something I've learned from a heartbreak (and this is coming from a guy who wears his heart on a sleeve) is this...you can choose to use that heartbreak as an opportunity to grow. 

So many people get themselves heartbroken in the worst ways and in the the most extreme cases suicidal! The best part about dating is this...there are plenty of other options. 7.7 BILLION people on this and he/she is the ""only"" one for you? Whether you're just hooking up or finding a steady relationships, at the end of the day you're still a master of your own emotions. Now sometimes you may catch feelings (again I'm a victim of this too), but you learn that's there really isn't ""the one"" but more ""the one for you"". You learn that you can find love with almost anyone if the chemistry is right.

These are just my 2 cents, I want to know what y'all beautiufl individuals think of this too.

And if you're reading this, know you are awesome and don't let anyone's mere hollow words bring you down. Okay bye!!",Stoicism,1615612516.0,t3_m3zr9a,0.97,1156

Epictetus on the reason why we are anxious,"When I see someone in a state of anxiety, I say, ‘What is it that he wants?’ For unless he wanted something that was not within his power, how could he still be anxious? [2] That is why a lyre-player* feels no anxiety when singing on his own, but becomes anxious when he enters the theatre, even if he has a fine voice and plays his instrument well. For he wants not only to sing well, but also to win the approval of his audience, and that is something that lies beyond his control. [3] Where he has skill, then, he has self-assurance too; bring any layman you please in front of him and he won’t be concerned; but where it is a case of something that he doesn’t know and has never studied, there he feels anxious. [4] So what does this mean? That he doesn’t know what a crowd is, or the applause of a crowd. He has learned, to be sure, how to strike the low and high notes, but what the praise of the mass of people is, and what value it holds in life, these are things that he neither knows nor has ever studied

How I've turned buying ice cream into a stoic practice,"This has been my secret for the past several months, and I call it a “secret,” because I’m not one to brag about good deeds. If you ever catch me giving money or food to the homeless on video for clout, please don’t hesitate to kick my ass. That being said, on the internet we’re all strangers to a degree so here it goes. 

Every day I take at least one walk. There’s a park in my neighborhood and a lap around it, and back to my apartment is almost exactly a mile. On these strolls I make it a rule to never take my headphones, and this opportunity to walk and think has become one of my favorite parts of my day. I pass tennis courts, baseball fields, a dog park, a Japanese garden, and skatepark. Each of these scenes offers an opportunity for people watching, and I’ve found a growing sense of sympatheia in enjoying the outdoors with so many others. 

A few months back I was kicking around the idea of righteous action in my mind. I came to the conclusion that the operating word here is action not righteous. We hear it all the time: talk not action. People will claim that they are a good person in order to combat a morally ambiguous action they’ve just committed. They’ll say if I had that kind of money then I would do A,B, and C to fight injustice, but I can’t because I don't. We’re all too familiar with that one guy friend who thinks he’s tough who asserts he would have made a difference on X situation if only they had been there. This guy tends to cause an eye roll on every head within a quarter mile radius. Ultimately, all of these are nothing more than empty words that add up to nothing.

As I was thinking about this, I turned a corner and saw a line of young skaters waiting to be served by an ice truck that is perpetually parked outside of the park. They were huddled together, passing singles back and forth so that they would have enough to order whatever they wanted from the truck. Instead of passing the truck like I usually do, I asked them if they would mind if I paid for whatever they wanted from the truck. They asked me if I was serious, I told them that I was, and they agreed. They were very thankful and polite about it, but I wasn’t about to hang around a bunch of 13 year old's as a man nearing 30 (that hurt to type), so as soon I as paid I was on my way back home. 

Then the next day the same thing happened. Line of skaters get a free treat on me. They’re stoked, I get to say I did a good deed to myself, and it’s a win-win. This repeats itself many times over the past several months. Sometimes there’s one kid, sometimes there seems to be an entire basketball team in line. As of recently, there does seem to be a bigger line than usual whenever I begin to pass the park…

But who cares? The reason I do it is not for good karma, or so that I can brag about it to my friends. I’ve told no one that I do this. The objective of me doing this is that I have a memorable experience on a daily basis that reminds me that action is the most important aspect of living a righteous life.

It’s like Macus said, *“Waste no time arguing what a good man should be. Be one.”*

Yesterday, something special happened that inspired me to write this post. As I was approaching the truck, I made my stop and asked a group of skaters if I could pay for their stuff, which they agreed to. This time there was another adult in line, and he asked what I was doing. I responded by saying, “I’m just picking up this tab. I didn’t have any money when I was their age, so it’s just something that I like to do,” and then I offered to pay for his stuff as well. 

He refused me, and instead asked if he could split the tab with me. I told him it was fine, but he insisted by removing cash from his pocket and placing it in my hands with one hand folded over mine.

“Take it,” he said. “I want to help.”

So I let him help. We both picked up the bill, and he thanked me for letting him pay. Later that night I was thinking about it a bit more, and came to the conclusion that practicing righteous action through compassion and kindness is candy for the soul. It’s putting positive energy back into the world that desperately needs it. But the evolution of this is inspiring other people to do the same. 

Yesterday, it was some random guy at the park offering to split the bill. Maybe tomorrow one of these kids will internalize the free ice cream, and help their mom out by doing the dishes. Maybe one of you will read this, and go show some love to someone who needs it. 

It’s a domino effect. Empathy breeds empathy. Whatever you put out in the world has a lasting effect that we might never see, but our actions here on earth ripple through eternity. 

Instead of thinking about how we can be good, or talking about how we can better, why don’t we just do it? Oftentimes it’s much easier than we think it's going to be. The key is taking action.",Stoicism,1637598428.0,t3_qzp9z9,0.98,1147

"Stoicism has turned my partner cold and distant. I want to support and embrace stoicism, but I can't.","**Edit:  So this blew up when I went to work.  I really appreciate all of the responses everyone has given. I've taken the time to read them all, and will re-read as well at my leisure.  A lot of things resonated with me, and I honestly did not think I'd have such an amazing response to this.**

Hello stoics,

This is a bit of a rant from the opposite side.  I've read some basic stoicism, and honestly I do 100% find value in a lot of the teachings (The Obstacle is the Way got me through losing my job at the beginning of COVID, William Irving's The Stoic Path is a great short series of meditations), but I have trouble with the true depths of it.  

While I dabbled in stoicism and tried to apply its wisdoms to my daily life as a casual reminder (I was fair weather stoic, I suppose), my partner has completely embraced it as a framework for his life.  I supported this, of course, and didn't say anything when he slowly started wearing his headphones all day while listening to audiobooks on stoicism, or meditating for an hour or more each morning and evening.

After some time of this I brought up my concerns that I feel like he's disconnected from me a little bit.  He confirmed that yes, he's removing attachments in his mind so as to not be bothered by the feelings of other people (i.e. me).  But, if I'm coming to him because I'm upset about something, I want him to react.  I don't want a blank stare and a ""You can choose to own your feelings or not, but they're not my responsibility"".  

This is where the turn happens in my mind.  There is nothing kind or virtuous or strong in becoming cold towards the people in your life in exchange for building a wall of strength and unmoveability.  

William Irving fervently insists that stoics being negative human beings is a stereotype and simply not true.  But is this cold negativity a phase all young stoics go through before coming out the other side and finding the balance of stoicism, wisdom, virtue, but also love and kindness and personality?  

Stoic meditation is a practice in appreciating what you have in the present.  Things like the Last Time Meditation or Prospective Introspection are purely there to essentially convince yourself that you love your life, despite the fact that it probably sucks.  Why would one have to throw themselves to deeply into practicing these meditations if they were happy?  Why do you need to convince yourself so aggressively that your life is good?  I don't need to meditate for hours a day to feel happy with, and in, my life.    **I'd in particular love if someone can change my view on this.  I'm very much struggling with this point here.**

"When first studying stoicism, I watched videos and wrote about the 12 rules of stoicism from the Enchiridion by Epictetus. I felt that maybe it was selfish to keep it myself, so here it is. This is what I wrote, enjoy!","1. Examine your impressions.

\-Ask ""Is this something that is in my control?"". If the answer is yes, act

on it rationally. If the answer is no, then ignore it.

\-Examine your reactions to the things around you.

\-Don't make impulsive emotional reactions to circumstances but instead

make rational decisions based on them.

\-Don't think about minor past decisions that can no longer be changed

or improved upon. Just 'keep calm and carry on' when faced with bad or

unfortunate circumstances.

&#x200B;

2. Remind yourself of the impermanence of things.

\-Understand that thing are changing constantly and universally.

\-Appreciate what and who you have now because life and everything around

you is impermanent.

\-Be happy that you can enjoy the things that you have in the present but

also that realise that those feelings of enjoyment can end abruptly.

\-Don't cling to the things that you enjoy and learn to realise and accept

that you are not entitled to them and you shouldn't cling to them.

&#x200B;

3. 'The Reserve Clause'.

\-Whenever planning an action, rehearse what your plan entails.

\-Realise that everyone, good or bad, faces certain situations which can be uncomfortable

or sad etc.

\-Face all situations with the best of your abilities whilst leaving what

must be left to the outcome to fate.

\-Sometimes things won't go your way, whether you deserved it or not.

&#x200B;

4. How can you use virtue here and now?

\-For every challenge, remember to use the resources that you have to cope

with it.

\-Use every challenge as a way to exercise your virtue in order to become a

better human being through constant application.

\-Look for ways to improve yourself from past situations and experiences.

\-Realise that you probably have a lot more self-control and patience than you

would generally think.

&#x200B;

5. Pause and take a deep breath.

\-Remember that in order to be harmed, you must not only be hit or insulted, but you

must also believe that you are being harmed. If someone seeks to provoke you, realise

that your mind is complicit in that provocation if you react by becoming provoked.

\-Rationally examine your impressions. Do not react immediately and instinctively to either

negative or positive emotions and situations, in order to act or react rationally.

\-Pause and take a deep breath, go for a walk or do something that will calm you down and

make sure that you can act rationally, before making an important decision or reaction.

\-Consider issues with logic and calmness.

&#x200B;

6. 'Other-ize'.

\-Realise that other people's hardships are just as distressing as your own and consider the effects

that those circumstances would have or have had on you. Also think about how something bad happening

to you would effect other people if they were in the same circumstances instead of you.

\-Realise that events affecting other people affect you very differently when the event happens to you

instead.

\-Realise that other people going through hard situations are often probably acting in a similar way to

which you would, so don't judge them too harshly for how they are reacting.

\-Realise that bad situations are normal occurrences and happen to everyone.

\-Understand that the universe isn't out to get anyone in particular, including you.

&#x200B;

7. Speak little and well.

\-Only say what is necessary. Don't talk about boring, uninteresting and unimportant things

when you are called to speak and above all else, don't gossip about other people or overly

praise or blame them for things.

\-Try to at least somewhat occasionally introduce challenging topics into conversations when

appropriate.

&#x200B;

8. Choose your company well.

\-Avoid people who are not good company such as people who are 'dirty' and the people surrounding

them also.

\-Pay close attention to who you spend you time your time with.

\-Consider of other people ""Are they making me a better person?"", ""Do they encourage me to push forwards?""

or ""Do they drag me down to their level?"" before letting them into your life.

&#x200B;

9. Respond to insults with humour.

\-Do not take insults too personally.

\-Insults are not in your control but how you react to them is.

\-Be comedically self-deprecating when appropriate after being insulted and learn to laugh at yourself.

&#x200B;

10. Don't speak too much about yourself.

\-Realise that just because you may enjoy talking about yourself, others may not enjoy listening to you doing so.

\-Understand that talking about yourself most likely releases dopamine, this being the reason why you feel the

need to do so.

\-Exercise some self-control and refrain from talking about yourself too much.

&#x200B;

11.Speak without judgement of others.

\-Do not say someone washes themselves badly, just that they wash themselves quickly for example, or that a person

drinks a lot of alcohol, instead of that they drink alcohol badly.

\-Realise that you cannot know whether people's actions are good or bad until you know the reasoning behind them.

\-Observe things literally and rationally and do not attach judgements to them.

\-Try to view the world as objectively as possible.

\-Look at people's characters and personalities as a whole instead of singling out their bad characteristics.

&#x200B;

12. Reflect on your day.

\-Look at the good things you have done and congratulate yourself and think of how you can improve on yourself

for the bad things that you have done throughout the day.

\-The philosophy isn't just about thinking, it is also about action.

\-Review your ethical performance for the day.

\-Don't beat yourself up about things that you did or how you acted, just forgive yourself and remember to find a way

to learn from both your good and bad actions to further improve yourself and try to repeat the good things that you did

throughout the day in the next day as well.

\-Be grateful for the good that has happened throughout the day.

Stoicism is a diet and not a medicine.,"I've said it on this sub before, but I keep seeing posts asking for stoic™ solutions, so I thought maybe it might help someone to repeat it.

Stoicism isn't a hodgepodge of solutions. You can't just jam a chunk of stoicism™ into your anxiety and voila! Life is a rainbow! No.

It's a diet. It's a form of discipline you stick to every day (as best you can) not for any pay-off, but because it's a good diet. It's fascinating and fun in and of itself. It's a bit like ""an apple a day keeps the doctor away"". You get healthier and stronger on a diet of stoicism, and you'll find a lot of areas of your life will improve. But, like a food diet, it takes time and discipline.

"You may leave this life at any moment: have this possibility in your mind in all that you do or say or think. (Marcus Aurelius, Meditations 2.11)","Life is like a visit to the beach. For some, when they arrive, the sun is shining and water is warm. For others, it may be storming with waves crashing against the shore. We can't control the weather, but only our reaction to it. If conditions are difficult, then the fortitude and courage we display in the face of adversity has meaning in of itself for we will know that we have acted with dignity. We proved ourselves worthy.

The time we spend here is brief and everything that we build are sandcastles: they will be gone soon after we've left, or even be wiped out while we build them. Wealth and power will all be gone in a few generations. We should do our best work despite this, for it is not the result of our work but the process that gives it meaning. 

In the meantime, if we can help those around us, for that moment we can ease the suffering of others. Love the ones around you and care for them. Just like you, they feel fear, anxiety, joy, pleasure, anger, and love. When you help one person, you help their entire world.

If our life is all we get to experience, then it's the only thing that matters. If the universe has no principles, the only principles relevant are the ones we decide on. If the universe has no purpose, then we get to dictate what its purpose is. Humans will most certainly cease to exist at some point, but before we do, we get to explore ourselves and the world around us. We get to experience feelings. We get to experience food, books, sunrises, and being with each other. The fact that we're even able to think about these things is already kind of incredible.

Last night I finally snapped,"I have been under a lot of pressure and stress lately, and I may have finally run out of fucks to give. 

Finding myself awake at 4am for no reason other than anxiety, I decided to throw the towel about worrying about everything.

- The problems between my parents are their own. Unless they hurt each other, their problems are theirs. They are not children and they don't need me to solve their problems.

- My (mentally challenged) brother wants to ruin his life with bad choices and bad friends? So be it. He is not my responsibility currently. And I made it clear to my parents that he will never be. I can help him of course, he is my brother, but I cannot help who doesn't want to be helped.

- My neighbours kids keep making noise in the apartment complex? No need to feel anxious right now. Once I move in (I'm rennovating), I can deal with that problem then. Right now I am wasting energy worrying about something that I cannot solve (at the moment)
- Studies and work problems - I just have two hands. I cannot do everything at the same time. I am learning to manage my time efficiently and I will tackle problems **one at a time**.

- Whatever other people think of me, its not my concern. People talk shit about everyone. I am not immune or special. Hell, people crucified Jesus Christ, they would absolutely wreck me if they were given the chance

- I am not and cannot be in control of everything. I accept that and from now on will only focus on what I can control. No more going out of my way to help or please people. I am simply human. If I wanted to please people, I would go on and sell ice cream like Steve Jobs once said.

- I accept I am flawed. And that is ok. Humans are flawed, no matter what social media tries to show.

You need to eat more pasta.,"I’ve been learning to speak Italian and I recently discovered a great little Italian idiom that I found very stoic.

Ne devi mangiare ancora di pastasciutta

Literally translated it means, “you need to eat more pasta” but what it really means is essentially “you need to grow older and wiser”. So the longer you live and experience life, the more pasta you eat.

That phrase really resonated with me, especially in this present moment. It’s taken several months of study and discipline, but I’m finally starting to see legitimate progress in my ability to apply these newly learned stoic philosophies to life in general.

Can anyone help me? I've been heavily reading on Stoicism for 6 months now so I think this is the best sub to seek advice. I'd like some thoughts or pointers to texts. Did Epictetus or M.A ever write anything similar to dealing with stuff like this?

When she said it to me, I felt hurt but didn't say anything. Right now she's visiting a friend's house so I'm alone right now as I type this. Right now I don't really feel sad or angry, just apathetic to the whole situation. I realize that what she said is out of my control and I should try to act virtuously. My question is how do I move forward from this? How do I do that virtuously? I'm not even sure that writing this post was a rational or emotional decision. Please help, thanks

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Thanks for all the comments, I had no idea this many people were so generous with their time, especially on a public site. I've read through all of them and I'll take that advice to heart.

For some context (and looking back at it), I don't believe my mother was 100% malicious towards me. My father is a good person, but he's a high functioning alcoholic and sometimes he can go too far with drinking, and that really makes my mom angry. My dad was actually going over to his friend's house (to drink) and my mom was going with him to watch over him, so they had an argument about it. A couple hours before that, I admit that I was giving her a little attitude over a disagreement, so she was already riled up with me. I think it was more of an outburst than anything. I also think my mother has some mental problems, my sister had depression so I think it may run in the family. My relationship with my mother is hard to describe. I don't feel like I have a true family (which is fine, I'm sure I'll find one later on), just 3 acquaintances living in the same house.  My sister is 25 and out of the house, but my relationship with her is also the same way.

To be honest I am quickly getting over the whole thing, but I feel somewhat guilty about it. I feel like I am expected to be more sad about it, but as of now I don't feel anything.

"Practice, practice, practice.","Hey you. Yeah you, the newcomer browsing this sub trying to figure out how to get started with Stoicism. You, the person who's going to post an ""OMG halp"" post. You, the person who's maybe read a Stoic book or two but is wondering how it applies to real life. This post is for you.

Stoicism is a fantastic philosophy that, when practiced correctly, can help you deal with any and all obstacles fate decides to put in your way. It doesn't matter what the hardship is, and that's the beauty of Stoicism; it can be used to deal with something as 'small' as a non-reciprocated high school crush or something as hard-hitting as the death of a loved one, financial ruin, or a global pandemic. In a Stoic's eyes, these are all the same thing. 

Stoicism is not some band-aid you slap on when you're feeling bad, though. In my mind it needs to be practiced as a preventative measure as well as a lifesaver in times of trouble. The more you practice it in the day to day when life is more or less going your way, the better it will serve you when defecation hits the oscillation. This is why, when someone asks ""how does a Stoic look at <bad thing>"" our answers can sound kinda cold and aloof: ""It doesn't matter."" ""Not worth thinking about."" ""Let it go and move on."". We can tell that you haven't put even a little effort into figuring it out for yourself.

So, how does one begin practicing Stoicism? Cold showers? Fasting? Sleeping on the ground? I mean, maybe, but I definitely understand how that can be a big turn-off for someone just beginning instruction. So I've outlined a few manageable things that anyone can start doing today, with no prior experience.

1) **Read.** My first suggestion will always be to get your education firsthand. Don't rely on some nice internet strangers to tell you what Stoicism is all about, get a good book(check the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/wiki/faq)) and dig in so you can begin to draw your own conclusions and custom fit it to your life. I like to recommend Epictetus's Enchiridion as a great starter. It's a relatively short read(was arranged to be a Handbook of Stoicism) but hella powerful. There is a free textfile [here](http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html) and a free audiobook [here](https://librivox.org/the-enchiridion-by-epictetus-tr-elizabeth-carter/). 

2) **Journal.** This can sound cheesy, but there's a reason we suggest it. One of the most important things you can learn to do is to reflect upon and analyze your own thought patterns and flow, and journaling, or a quiet time of reflection at the end of the day, helps loads with that. It doesn't have to be super structured, just a few notes stream-of-conscious style about how your day went, what upset you, why you think it upset you, what made you happy, why it made you happy, and so on. Then at the end of the week, read over what you wrote down and try to identify the externals that you give the most attention to. This, more often than not, will allow you to really focus on what areas you need to work on the most. *As a side benefit, if you are struggling with mental health issues, a journal is a fantastic tool for you and your therapist to use for your treatment.*

3) **Be present in the moment.** Living in the past leads to depression, living in the future leads to anxiety, living in the now leads to happiness. Easier said than done, I know, but one way is to try your best throughout the day to think and act intentionally. When you find yourself doing or thinking something, and you don't remember intentionally beginning that thought or action, retrace your steps/train of thought and try to find out how you got there. Don't go through the motions. 

Baby steps.

Stoicism is not some switch you flip and suddenly you're this invincible Stoic that nothing can harm. It takes time and practice. There are no ""masters"", no ""apprentices"", we are all Prokopton here. It's a journey, and we want to help you along it, but we can't take the steps for you because we're still taking them beside you.

Stoicism Rules for Life,"My husband shared this with me and I thought it was too good not to share.  I would love the author to get credit so please, if you know the source, mention it.

“When the standards have been set,” Epictetus said, “the work of philosophy is just this, to examine and uphold the standards, but the work of a truly good person is in using those standards when they know them.”

Define your rules. Live by them:

2. You control how you respond to things.

3. Ask yourself, “Is this essential?”

4. Meditate on your mortality every day.

5. Value time more than money and possessions.

6. You are the product of your habits.

7. Remember you have the power to have no opinion.

8. Own the morning.

9. Put yourself up for review. Interrogate yourself.

10. Don’t suffer imagined troubles.

11. Try to see the good in people.

12. Never be overheard complaining—even to yourself.

13. Two ears, one mouth for a reason.

14. There is always something you can do.

15. Don’t compare yourself to others.

16. Live as if you’ve died and come back (every minute is bonus time).

17. “The best revenge is not to be like that.” —Marcus Aurelius

18. Be strict with yourself and tolerant with others.

19. Put every impression, emotion, to the test before acting on it.

20. Learn something from everyone.

21. Focus on process, not outcomes.

22. Define what success means to you.

23. Find a way to love everything that happens.

24. Seek out challenges.

25. Don’t follow the mob.

26. Grab the “smooth handle.”

27. Every person is an opportunity for kindness.

28. Say no (a lot).

29. Don’t be afraid to ask for help.

30. Find one thing that makes you wiser every day.

31. What’s bad for the hive is bad for the bee.

32. Don’t judge other people.

33. Study the lives of the greats.

34. Forgive, forgive, forgive.

35. Make a little progress each day.

36. Journal.

37. Prepare for life’s inevitable setbacks.

38. Look for the poetry in ordinary things.

39. To do wrong to one, is to do wrong to yourself.

40. Always choose “alive time.”

41. Associate only with people that make you better.

42. If someone offends you, realize you are complicit in taking offense.

43. Fate behaves as she pleases…do not forget this.

44. Possessions are yours only in trust.

45. Don’t make your problems worse by bemoaning them.

46. Accept success without arrogance, handle failure with indifference.

47. Courage. Temperance. Justice. Wisdom. (Always).

48. The obstacle is the way.

49. Ego is the enemy.

50. Stillness is the key.

I’ll leave you with the one rule that captures all the rules. It comes from Epictetus: “Don’t explain your philosophy. Embody it.”

Marcus Aurelius reminded himself and now us, “Waste no more time talking about what a good man is like. Be one.”

"Alright, this has to be said, AGAIN, STOICISM IS NOT ABOUT BEING EMOTIONLESS.","Recently there has been a surge in posts where people want to avoid feeling or become isolated and expressionless.

They can be summed up in:

* If I make X things I will not feel BAD STUFF.
* Emotions make you weak and we should repress them.
* Tough men are not ruled by emotions and to show them it is a sign of weakness.
* I should isolate myself.

None of them become any close of what Stoicism is about, so let me remind you why these are failures:

* If I make X things I will not feel BAD STUFF. But bad stuff will happen to you eventually and you will feel bad because of it, it is beyond your control to decide how the world acts upon you, Stoicism is not about controlling emotions, it is about learning to control ourselves despite our emotions and to distinguish which aspects of life we can control and which ones we can not and to learn to accept the later. If you guide yourself by avoidance then you may be sparing yourself some pain, but pain can be a teacher too, and if you skip class, you won't learn.
* Emotions make you weak and we should repress them. No, let me repeat this: NO! Emotions are part of our humanity, we don't get to choose which parts we want and which ones we do not, to have emotions is beyond our control as humans, and to repress them will only lead towards nothing good. A Stoic acknowledges such emotions as part of himself or herself, they are a natural component of humanity, which is something beyond our control, we can't help to be human, we were born like this. What a Stoic seeks is to not be dominated by emotions, because sometimes they cloud our judgement and lead to consequences that were not intended. There is also foolishness in thinking we can repress separate emotions and allow certain emotions to come, no, they are not separated items, it is more of a spectrum, you can't just block a part of it and pretend the parts you like to come freely and allow yourself to feel only that. A Stoic understands its emotions and learns from them, without allowing them to steer the ship that it is its self.
* Tough men are not ruled by emotions and to show them it is a sign of weakness. These kind of people live in a paradox where they don't want to be ruled by emotions because they don't want to be seen as week by other men because they fear what such display of weakness would bring upon them. These people live in fear, which is an emotion, therefore already defeated themselves without any effort. Again, Stoicism comprises not to deny our emotions but to separate them from our actions and our choices, and to understand what they bring to the table, think of them as an advisor which would suggest, without obligation, a course of action which you may choose or not depending on your own rational criteria.
* I should isolate myself. Why in the world would you do this? If you can't become your own island in a sea of people what makes you think you will make it when on your own? You would be building a sand sculpture of yourself only to watch it crumble as soon as the tide shifts. No, to be surrounded by people is part of our human existence, and we should seek to be our own refuge even when surrounded by terrible circunstances. If you need the world to be gone to be at peace with yourself then you can't achieve peace at all, because the world does not depends on you.

What else am I forgetting?

Oh yeah, simple guidelines:

1. Accept the world as it is and yourself as you are and not as you would like it or you to be.
2. Remember you are dying so try to not waste any opportunity.
3. It is what it is, once is out of your control there is no point in making yourself miserable.
4. The ship metaphor, again, if your existence would be a ship would you allow any emotion to steer it for you? Or would you take the wheel as captain and listen to your emotions for suggestion and then decide whether they are worth following or not?
5. The river metaphor, emotions flow like a river, if you build a dam to block the parts you don't want to collect water from the other side you won't get as much water as before, if you get anything at all.
6. Don't tell people to ""man up"" or to not feel, that's not healthy and that's not being Stoic.

What else am I forgetting?

"Just deleted my facebook and instagram account (1600 friends, 1089 followers)","I was watching a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6e1riShmak) on a facebook executive talking about the unintended negative consequences from apps like instagram and facebook. Apps where you broadcast your life in the most appealing way, and how that effects our society. While personally I feel like it doesn't effect me as much as perhaps a girl my age browsing instagram seeing girls with perfect bodies, and perfect boyfriends goin to their beach house and dining on the lake etc. I realized that slowly the things I began to desire were the things that were being cherry picked by people I know. I began to lose my identity and who I was, I was wasting time, and although instagram definitely had its merits, I could delete it and have the comfort of returning to it at any point. However, now that I have officially taken the steps to permanently delete my name, and account from both facebook and instagram, I feel like i have this enormous weight lifted off my shoulders, I feel like I am not burdened to maintain an image, but I can strive for what I want most in this world. I had some anxieties about it. Like what if something really incredible happened to me, like i got into med school, or get engaged or had a child. All these milestones in my life that others would not know about. But then I thought, what does it matter if people dont know I'm becoming a doctor or a lawyer, so long as I am actively helping others and fufilling my purpose in life, so what if people cant see that I am on a date with my gf, I have a beautiful person I get to spend my time with and have nothing else on my mind, so what if I get married and the only people who get to see the pictures are the people I invited to the wedding, thats how it should be, When I have a daughter so what if my extended friends i knew 7 years ago in highschool never get to see her, I will feel so much more gratified from the people who choose to come spend time with her.

If I die, or anybody I know dies, I will mourn them, but the amount of people that mourn me or my family members doesn't effect me. I don't need posts when I die.

We continued talking, and I drew the distinction between being stoic and being Stoic. 

Then, I described the Stoic practice of identifying and examining the first movements of the soul, in order to better understand the roots of our passions, and to relate rationally and healthily to our emotions. 

It was then it hit me that Stoicism has been providing an answer for thousands of years to the type of lower-case stoicism prevalent in our culture. 

Practicing Stoics are intimately acquainted with their emotions. They can read their emotions the way seasoned mariners understand the cresting waves and the ebb and flow of the tides. 

So rather than feed into unhealthy emotional suppression found all too often in our young men (I see this among my high school students), a Stoic approach finds a way out by means of a way through. 

“The obstacle is the way”, as Marcus would put it. 

Thank you for reading,

Update: Thank you for the thoughtful responses and the awards! I was unaware how upsetting the term Toxic Masculinity would be for this group of Stoics. Given the way Stoics of the past like Cato the Younger and Marcus Aurelius were actively engaged in the political realm, I was under the impression politics were part of a Stoic’s engagement. We’re not Epicureans. 

Still, I’ll refrain from posting such terms in the future, but would encourage folks commenting on the existence or nonexistence of TM or those going on tangents about SJW to reread this post. 

Regardless, whatever conclusions reached seemed right to them, as Epictetus would say, and that’s not up to me.",Stoicism,1602433960.0,t3_j98iqe,0.91,1058

Observations by a dying stoic - part 3,"Sort of interesting how my perception of the limited time I have left is playing out. Even though I practiced visualing my death, it was always an abstract thing. I knew it would happen but lived as if it wouldn't until I was in my eighties. I have the family history for that, my parents are in their 80s and still mostly independent.

So now there is more focus on this as death approaches much sooner. My overall stoic practice has sharpened a bit but the real thing that changed most immediately was my view of physical things. A quote I read one time said that all you own will be found on the day of your death and belong to someone else. With that in mind making purchasing decisions has really tightened up. Before I would buy the best quality I could afford, now I usually pass on personal items all together.

I did go buy a new car for my wife. It's a practical vehicle but still very nice. Has a 10 year/125k mileage warranty and includes first 5 years of maintenance. I'm not going to exceed the warranty, but I wanted to make sure my wife was taken care of after I am gone. Without the diagnosis I would have made an entirely different and less practical choice.

So when another redditor asked if my diagnosis would change the way I lived, I rejected the idea thinking my stoic studies would continue as before. But now I have to say it really has. I weigh buying things against what I need to try to extend my life versus things I simply want. Not in a desperate rage against the dying of the light kind of thing but accepted by and still fighting. I would say my focus has tightened and I am humbled by the kindness and generosity of family and friends and even strangers, and no longer let that pass without acknowledging it. So thanks to all of you redditors that take the time to read and engage with this fellow traveler.",Stoicism,1617158539.0,t3_mgwcpf,0.99,1051

Don't think that by shutting yourself off or running around pretending to not care is a stoic practice, it isn't. Many of those who join us have in their minds that stoicism is some kind of band aid. Maybe because they were taught so by pop culture, maybe because that's a trait many men want to have.

"We spend so much time in our heads or absurdity, then life, like a brief flash, has passed you by.",">Edit: Thank you for the upvotes and awards. It does make me feel that what I said and my position resonates with people, and that this is a great concern for nearly everyone in our society. I will continue to delve on this subject and hopefully continue to add advice for this community for all to benefit from. Anything I learn from life, I would like to share with you, so that we grow together and not make the same mistakes. Let's all keep searching together.

Your parents get old. They die. So do your grandparents.

Your friends get married. You lose touch.

Your get old yourself.

**And what did you really spend your life doing?**

Look at the people on reddit. There is good, yes, but there's also endless argument, political or otherwise.

**Think about the absurdity of all this \*\*\*\* and how much we attribute meaning and importance to it. Or even random arguments we have on a daily/weekly basis, or the various strong emotions like petty anger or vengeance we seek to inflict on others, or the meaningless little goals we seek to fulfill.**

**We do all this...But we don't live in the moment. We don't see our mother, our father, get old, get frail, and before we know it, they die.** And then you wonder if you should maybe have lived in the moment and spent more time with them.

I know its maybe a common thought but it really hit me how you should savor the moment and how brief life is. I'm a millenial and feel old already. My parents are starting to look frail and death is smiling at them. My friends are looking old. Getting married or having kids.

I feel like I spent my 20s in meaningless arguments, meaningless angst, meaningless suffering. And its gone, I'm now 31.

**Don't you ever think about the modern capitalist world makes us feel like life is infinite due to the endless distractions and useless goals we are made to seek? The majority of us seem to live meaningless lives and we die at the end, bitter and wondering how the F it went by so fast.**

We're so caught up in our little egotistical quests that we don't realise we're supposed to live. Modern society has taken us so far from our animal nature (animals only live in the present) that we basically are incapable of savoring the moment and things like **memento mori** feel hollow until we see the face of our ageing parents or worse yet, their coffins.

How meaningless most of us are, how easily we waste our lives instead of living the most each day. Most of us wake up too late, on our deathbeds or crying as our parents and loved ones die.

If you are in this situation/mindset now, like I am, please change. Please make the most of tomorrow. Or you will cry of despair when you regret it later. **Focus on what truly matters.

"My grandfather is dying, and I admire my grandparents' reflection of it","I recently got the news that my grandfather's time is running out. He had always been a healthy man, and before this rapid decline in the past two years, he had never slept a night in a hospital bed. Last christmas was the first that I spent with my partner's family instead of my own, and instead of wallowing in useless guilt about imaginary ideas that I should have spent ""our last christmas"" with them, I called my grandmother today, and from now on will do so regularly.

 My grandparents have been married for over 65 years, and loved each other for the entire length of it. My grandmother told me that on the hospital bed as he was last taken in, he had smiled and told her that at least he'll be leaving a quite good-looking widow. While his memory and understanding of time and space are failing as well, his sense of humour is still very much there. They both know he is dying, and I was prepared to offer whatever little support or comfort I could.

Instead, she talked about what a good run they have had together. What a good age he had reached in perfect health, and how few people even do so. A beloved spouse she has spent her entire life with is dying, and she only calmly spoke about how good life has been, how grateful she is that it has lasted this long.

 My grandparents, who never had the time to read books or bother with such things as ""philosophy"", are true stoics, and I am glad and grateful that I have had the chance to know them at this age, when I've reached enough maturity to appreciate it.",Stoicism,1640696030.0,t3_rqf8f0,0.99,1029
Practicing Stoicism has practically cured my anxiety,"I used to be an overthinker. Now I'm just a thinker. 

For a long time I had no idea what the fuck was the matter with me. My brain was constantly racing with thoughts and most of them didn't benefit me at all. I'd think about my insecurities, relationships, people's opinions of me, and all the other stresses that come with work and being a young adult in world that seemed to change every time I blinked. 

And to be honest, I was also bit of a narcissist. Not in a way that I treated people poorly, but I was happy with the way I looked and above all I thought I was smart. Life was going well for me. Externally at least. I graduated college with a decent job (that actually ended up being a really shit job), and being well read meant that I could keep up with some of the older professionals that I was trying to impress. This provided other opportunities for me, and I began climbing the social pyramid. To the world I was progressing fast. Any accomplishment I made quickly lead to another. 

But with each accomplishment I felt more empty. Less of myself. For every positive thing in my life, I was overwhelmed by the potential negatives. Most of it it had to do with me losing whatever I had just gained. Other times it was as simple as fixating on something I hated about me, and not being able to get my brain to shut the fuck up about it. Waking up in the morning was a chore because it meant having to spend the entire day locked in my own head. It was as if I was the prisoner and the jail keeper. At the center of my despair was the inability to control any aspect of my mind. The irony is that me fighting for authority, ultimately granted me less of it. I was an experiencing a sensory overload every second of the day and wanted out of the game. And let me be the first to tell you that wanting ""out of the game"" will take you to some dark places. 

At some point, a lawyer who I had been working for suggested that I read Meditations by Marcus Aurelius because he thought it would be up my alley. I bought the wrong edition (Dover Swift), found it too dense, but then bought the Hayes edition and fell in love. 

Of course, it wasn't love at first site. Stoicism and I had an on-again, off-again relationship for a while where I would get really into it and then drop it for months. Then about three years ago, I hit a point mentally where I realized something had to give. I decided to commit to philosophy and all of the practices involved. Let me be the first to tell you that being a stoic transformed my life. 

Currently I'm about 80% stoic in terms of my personal philosophy, but that 80% is the best part of the meal. Putting into practice ideas like focusing what's in your control, adjusting to circumstances without stressing over them, attempting to be a person with admirable character, and overall embodying the philosophy we express that we believe in has cured me of so many of the anxieties that used to haunt me. 

I'm not perfect by any means, but perfection isn't the goal. The goal is simply to be better. And if we can do anything at all, we can at least do that.",Stoicism,1634830054.0,t3_qcuc2v,0.98,1032
I suffer quite a bit now realizing how much time and youth I’ve wasted on internet escapism to run from my problems for years. I picked myself up a year ago and went into therapy. I’ve changed alot. Everything that doesn’t futher my process feels like escapism now.,"Even stuff thats supposed to be fun. My friends feel like druggies now (they just smoke weed). 

Nothings fun anymore. Ice cold reality it feels like. This change in reality for me is mentally exhausting right now. Any stoic advice or letters about personal development and the sacrifice that comes with it?

EDIT: I no longer have stuff to do to numb the pain with. Being aware of all this is a very harsh and also the reason I'm suffering from it. I can't use the internet, weed or literally anything else to escape anymore, because I know that's exactly what I did. I believe need to fill the hole with something else that fits this process I'm going through. And it's hard to find that.

EDIT 2: I’m not aversive towards people or my friends having fun. I’m just not on that wavelenght anymore. I need a big setting change from where im at. But thats far away from now. I have this empty space I can’t fill. I do everything I can to help myself in this situation. I see my therapist once a week. Turned my bedroom into home fitness because of lockdown. Seeing this girl I’m also in a sexual relationship with. Im doing what I think is healthy. Sometimes actions dont cut it. Running 5 miles doesn’t lift me like it did anymore. But this is where philosophy and acceptance helps as you guys mention. I believe only time will do something now. I’ll stick with all that but let time do it’s job. Thank you for all the wonderful advice. I really appreciate it and that’s why I ask you guys. This philosophy gives us the opportunity to unlock the best versions of ourselves and to have that is my privilige. I fall out sometimes but once you’ve experienced the force philosophy carries you want it back at some point.

"Tip: You may not be able to choose what thoughts you have, but you can very often choose what thoughts you -finish.-","Very often the negative thoughts we have fit into a script, they're things we tell ourselves that we know will be especially painful, or push our buttons, or whatever.  ""I am the worst person in the world,"" thought several hundred million people, word for word verbatim.   
  
So, with that bit of knowledge in mind, here's what you can do to help address negative ruminations: You can stop them in their tracks.  Ctrl+Alt+Delete their ass on the first word, and it's both pretty simple and pretty easy to do, if you know how, so here's how:  
  
**STEP 1:** Identify your script.  
  
 * You know what you tell yourself, you know the exact words, the exact sentences, you know them by heart, we all do.  It's always the same thing, rarely if ever does it vary.  Figure out the actual words, that's your starting point.  
  
**STEP 2:** Recognize the thought.  
  
 * Learn to recognize the whole thought from the first word, though you probably already do.  When my brain says ""I'm,"" I already know that ""The worst person in the world."" is what comes next, always, invariably.  ""Nobody,"" and then comes ""Could possibly love me.""  ""Everybody,"" is followed by ""Hates me.""  Learn to recognize these thoughts as soon as they pop up.  
  
**STEP 3:** Interrupt the thought.  
  
 * Easier said than done, right?  Actually no.  Recognizing what's coming allows you to step in and redirect your attention.  The human brain can't think two thoughts at once, we can think two thoughts very very closely together, but not at once.  When you recognize the thought you can choose to think something else, but it *is* a choice.  I use the ^*""NOPE!""* technique, and it works exceptionally well, as soon as you see the first word, the first sign of a negative thought, interrupt it with a ^*""NOPE!""* and move on to something else.  It sounds too easy to work, but it absolutely can work.  
  
An example:  
  
 1. Identify script: ""I'm the worst person in the world.""  
 2. Recognize the thought: ""I'm,"" is followed by ""the worst person in the world.""  
 3. Interrupt the thought: *""I'm ^NOPE!! ~~the worst person in the world.""~~*  

Important disclaimer: If you're anything like me you might find yourself running at sixty nopes per second at first as your depression fights back, but stick to it, give it a real chance, it's gonna' be a fight for a while, but it's one I believe you *can* win.
  
Recognizing the thought gives you a moment, a beat, an opportunity to move your attention elsewhere (or do anything else with that moment that you care to, for that matter.)  
  
I don't know if it's necessary, but I'd strongly encourage you to pick something dismissive, I chose *NOPE!* because it's got that fed-up-and-fuck-you tone that I want to respond to my negative thoughts with, ""Nah."" would also work, or ""lol,"" whatever, something that drains the thought of its power.  Though here in /r/Stoicism/ a strong and solid ""No."" might be the best choice.  
  
There you go, everything you need to know, you can nope right out of those thoughts if you want to, just because you start them doesn't mean you have to finish them.  
  
---  
  
We tend to respect our negative thoughts, they come to us in our own voice, and we presume, logically, that they're trying to help us in some way.  ""Maybe if I call myself a stupid piece of shit for not taking out the trash I'll remember to take out the trash next time.""  It's about as effective as breaking your own ankle in hopes that the punishment will improve your awful mile time: Sounds good, doesn't work.  If you've got depression or negative thinking patterns, those thoughts aren't out to help you, they're out to hurt you, that's their goal, their purpose, their *intent,* so why listen to that?  If you know that Dave (in accounting) hates your guts with a passion, then why should you believe him when he says you look like crap?  Why should you even listen to him?  Why not hear his voice and choose instead to think about how damn fine you look today?  
  
You don't have to *listen* to your own thoughts.  
You don't have to *respect* your own thoughts.  
You don't have to *finish* your own thoughts.  
  
Just because it exists doesn't mean it has value to you, doesn't mean it helps you in any way, and if these thoughts don't help you in any way (or anyone else for that matter) when why bother listening to them, why give *them* value when they don't give *you* value?  
  

Also, and importantly, I don't want this to be a ""Wow, thanks, I'm cured."" sort of post.  You can't nope away bipolar disorder or clinical depression, this isn't a cure, it's to help you *cope.*  Please, please, *please* don't stop going to therapy or taking your medications because of a reddit post, okay?  This is *a* tool for your *toolbox,* it is meant to be an addition, a supplement, not a replacement.  It works well, but much like *just* doing sit ups at the gym, it's not everything you'll need to be healthy.

I don't want to kill myself but I see it as the only viable solution for my life to become better.,"I am fully aware that killing or harming oneself does against the Stoic virtues and should be avoided/forgone, no matter the struggle in front of us.

With that said, I have this nagging feeling that my life is a wasted one from the very first breath I have taken and over the recent years, I have been seeing more and more instances of my life being worthless and without value, despite being firm on the Stoic values and taking the necessary steps to fight the suicidal thoughts: therapy, meds, reading, sports, talking to other people, and nothing works.

Worst part is, the slightest rejection by another person, especially a woman I might be romantically interested in, becomes an emotional pain that is so agonizingly debilitating that the suicidal thoughts pop-up on their own every time, as the ""ultimate solution"" to not hurt anymore.

I don't know how to deal with this anymore. I already have so very few opportunities with women in my life (given that they are all taken already and those that aren't don't want *me* for a long term relationship) and the ones I get turn sour almost immediately.

"Stoicism is a ""Dull"" Philosophy","On multiple occasions people have told me how Stoicism is a ""dull"" or weak philosophy. How the Stoics didn't push the envelope when it came to intellectual ideas. Therefore, their work isn't anything special.

When I hear this, it reveals to me they don't understand it's purpose or place.

The Stoics were not interested in pushing the envelope of the bleeding edge of ideas, they were interested in realizing and embodying the highest good;  quelching the fear of death, being honest and virtuous. They weren't interested in mastering debate with others, they were busy mastering the disharmony in themselves. They didn't need to feel superior by holding new and fantastic ideas over other, they were content with little, and needed only their virtue for their pride, honor, and self-worth.

They didn't hold themselves back from new philosophy, nor did they suggest Stoicism was the highest or best philosophy. It's really less of a philosophy, in the sense most people approach it, and more of a reliable and sturdy tool / vehicle to keep the soul and mind free and clear from unnecessary chaos. Take it or leave it, but calling it dull or weak seems to be missing the point.",Stoicism,1593718816.0,t3_hk3tju,0.99,1024

Don’t constantly crave happiness,"If you’re not happy right now, that’s okay. If you’re sad, you can be sad.

Don’t feel pressure to be anything. This is the lesson I struggle with. I find myself being critical of my choices, appearance, emotions, position. I want change in so many areas and I work really hard to make that happen. 

You may know that this is called Hedonic Adaption. It’s a brilliant system for growth over the long term, but in the moment it feels like pressure. And the more pressure you have to change things, the more you’ll feel stressed. 

You achieve something new and before you know it you’re back to craving more. It’s like being hungry all the time. What you crave changes hour by hour, but the craving persists. Can you keep the drive to do stuff, and feel less stressed?

I think so. There are many tools, but two which have helped me are Meditation and Gratitude. 

Meditation hones your skill of noticing what’s happening. It’s crazy to think we need help with this, but evidence suggests that our mind wanders all the time. And without knowing what’s happening right now, more and more, its a lot harder to take action. 

Gratitude acts directly against hedonic craving. If you’re happier with what you have, your mind won’t bother as much about what you don’t. 

There’s already so much info out there about these two things, but a regular daily practice is the only thing that works for me. 

That’s what I’m trying to focus on during these difficult times. And the worries I had about less productivity and purpose is faulty thinking. It’s bullshit created by a mind addicted to always having more. I am instead calmer and less stressed, which gives me more energy to do the things I want to do.",Stoicism,1591273000.0,t3_gwgbxt,0.99,1016

I just had a moment where it clicked.,"3,5 years ago I was introduced to stoicism in my philosophy class, just the basic ""who is who"" and where it originated from. I digested the basic thoughts of the philosophy but didn't dig deeper. 

Since last summer, I began researching it again and reading books. On christmas this year, my girlfriends parents gifted me ""The Daily Stoic"" by Ryan Holiday and I began establishing my daily routine of reading a page a day, meditating and journaling. 

Yesterday, on day 8, there was this quote: 

>We must give up many things to which we are addicted, considering them to be good. Otherwise, courage will vanish, which should continually test itself. Greatness of soul will be lost, which can't stand out unless it disdains as petty what the mob regards as most desirable. -Seneca, *Moral Letters*, 74.12b-13

I use the journaling app ""stoic."" too and during my morning routine a quote by Siddharta Gautama, which was about how wins and losses, praise and guilt, pleasure and grief come and go. To be happy, we have to be rooted between all of that like a tree. 

I then began staring at the ceiling and thinking about why I am so sad when I think about past relationships. I never got to the end before, I mean, I have a happy relationship with my current girlfriend and long for nothing, really. So why was it then, that I'm so sad of the past? 

Then it began to hit me, that I always invested everything of myself in these relationships. Like an addiction, I was addicted to the feelings, whether they were good or bad. I began to understand that the reason I never got over my past relationships was because I gave so much of myself, that when they failed I clung to the sad feelings instead of accepting what is not in my control and gain clarity of the addiction I had to these people. 

After that realization I started to meditate and I never meditated so good that I felt completely free and ecstatic, as if I could fly. It just all made click.",Stoicism,1610201068.0,t3_ktrgiy,0.99,1020

Don't expect people to notice the positive changes you're making,"*""It's quite possible to be a good man without anyone realizing it. Remember that."" - Marcus Aurelius 7.67*

The path to self-improvement is a rigorous journey. It demands so much of us. Practicing stoicism is no different from learning anything else. It calls for dedication, and requires us to put ourselves under a microscope and dissect our own insecurities and shortcomings with objectivity and precision. It is an internal journey, and yet our instincts can lead us to seek external approval for our efforts. 

Unless the difference is night and day, do not expect anyone to notice the ways in which you've improved yourself. Whether your learning to deal with your anxiety, climbing out of paralyzing depression, or even coping with feelings of existential dread and are just starting to see the light. Do not expect your neighbor to notice. We do not need their validation to validate our progress. 

Why did you start this campaign to be better in the first place? Was it to curry favor with those around you or was it to live a better life with a healthier perspective on the world around us?

I woke up today! Momento Mori.,"I've studied stoicism for several years. I struggle on a daily basis to work my learnings into every day life. My emotions, desires, biases, and perceptions control me on a daily basis.

That being said, my two year old son gave me passionate reminder of 'memento mori.'

I was up early, doing some writing and drinking coffee. All in all a good morning.

I hear my son get out of bed. I check my phone... he is up a little early. I'm a little annoyed that my free time is cut short, but I wasn't enjoying what I was working on anyway.

Oliver, my son, walks around the corner. He shows no signs of sleep in his eyes, but his hair is sticking out in every direction. He still walks with the clumsiness of a toddler, but Oliver doesn't let that slow him down. He spreads his arms wide and beams a smile at me.

""I woke up today!"" he shouted, joy clinging to every word.

It was pure celebration. He was announcing it to the world. 

It was passionate enough to give me pause and stir my thoughts. I didn't know what to say. My tiny terror, my little man, had just embodied momento mori in such a pure, innocent way. What could I possibly say that would match his enthusiasm and profound insight? What could I say that would show him that my happiness matched his own?

""That is awesome!"" I said back, spreading my arms. We hugged, and I held him for as long as he would allow. 

You woke up today, and that is awesome.

Edit - I have made a spelling error! I originally had momento instead of memento!

Another edit - my garbage spelling aside - when he came out and said that, my first thought was ""was not waking up even an possibility?"" As I thought through it, I came to the conclusion that of course it was a possibility! Either of us could've died in our sleep. It happens every day. It seemed a little too morbid to include in the original post, but here we are.

I shivered at the thought, but it was all too real at that point.  

So, my son's celebration of life served as a reminder that we will all die, often at a time we do not expect.

Stoics! It’s the start of the week so these are some advices I hope will make this week great for you!,"1.) when you wake up, remind yourself that whatever may happen today is because it is part of our fate and let it not control our emotions and live in what is now.
2.) when you start feeling emotions like anger, sadness, jealousy and other negative feelings. Let them go. Focus on what you can control and don’t let your emotions control you.
3.) learn to love “what is”. 
4.) practice the banquet of life: when it comes your way, enjoy it. When that time is done with you, then let it pass. You had your time. 
5.) practice your strength which is the ability of holding oneself. 
6.) circumstances have no care for your feelings.
7.) you don’t always have to have an opinion. Sometimes it’s better to say “I don’t know” than get into an argument. 
8.) in the evening, reflect about your day. Reflect on your emotions and feelings.
9.) journal, journal and JOURNAL!! It’s a great way for future reflections and see how you’ve grown as a person.
10.) ENJOY YOUR WEEK!!! Be happy. Enjoy and good luck with this week everyone!

"For me Stoicism isn't about controlling your feelings, it's about controlling your actions.","Not sure if my personal take on Stoicism is 100% aligned with the dogma, but frankly I don't really care as I don't see Stoicism as a dogmatic religion. For me Stoicism is a tool to help me live a better life.

I see so many posts here about people trying to control their feelings with Stoicism. People feel bad or angry and are looking for help with these emotions. I also see lots of posts of people saying they used Stoicism to feel calm or sanguine in a stressful situation. For me these types of posts miss the point.

For me, Stoicism is about optimizing your actions. It's about keeping focused on ""Right Action"" in the face of adversity (and everyday life). It's about taking the best actions and best steps to improve your life regardless of what's going on. I don't think you should or even can ""not feel bad"" when shit happens. Bad stuff definitely happens and it will make you feel bad feelings. You will see your friends and family die. You will get sick and die yourself. You will get cut off in traffic. You will make some very bad decisions that you regret. This is life. For me the point here is not to get so caught up in the pain of those bad things that you don't move forward and take the best right actions you can to improve your life ahead. More simply it's not ""Think Positive"" it's ""Take Positive Action"".

Speaking from personal experience, I was diagnosed with Stage 4 colon cancer at age 42. It definitely made me scared, sad, angry, etc. Stoicism has helped me do my best to focus my actions on anything and everything that I can do to try to improve my odds of survival and live my best life in the meantime. I worked to find the best doctors I could, did everything they advised, took my medicine and got the chemo, radiation, surgery, etc as fast as possible. I did my best to eat stuff that could help and avoid stuff that might not help. I get as much exercise as possible. It's been 3 years and I've been in complete remission for over 2. Docs are optimistic I'm likely fully ""cured"" and could even live a normal lifespan -- but no guarantees for sure and the next few years are still rather uncertain. 

Stoicism definitely didn't directly help me feel good or not bad - BUT - it did give me something to focus on and the idea of ""Right Action"" felt like a lifeline for me. Going through that was difficult but somehow the best thing that's ever happened to me (especially if I do really get fully cured). It's given me much more perspective so just thought I'd share.

The universe owes you *nothing*,"Isn’t it interesting that we all wake up every day with the feeling that this day is owed to us? Considering basic human rights, yes we deserve to be alive and not under threat, but we are just an organism like bees or ants making our own rules that have absolutely no value from the perspective of the universe, which is the ruler of all. Yet we live our lives as if everything we have or will have, like more time or a nice car or fancy food or health is a guarantee. Says who? Just us humans who believe we are in charge of nature & the universe. Spoiler: we aren’t.

And how much human emotional suffering can be attributed to this idea of being owed things just because you currently exist? Constantly operating with the belief that you deserve certain things (aside from basic human rights) inevitably sets your mind up for disappointment, sadness and suffering.

"If you never ask yourself why you feel something, you will always be susceptible to those feelings.","Hey all,

So a ton of posts on here are about ""How can I not feel bad about XYZ"". And for the most part, these questions (and their answers) are looking at things from a point of view of ""How can I not externalise this emotion"" which can be useful on the short-term for navigating specific situations or going about your day less impeded by an emotion but this is Stoicly painting over the cracks.

Yes, we consider it good to control your own reactions but how stoic is this actually? If someone externally behaves 'properly' but is internally dominated by their emotions then what's been achieved that stoicism would call good? Nothing really... Not only are we going to be less capable than our potential for anything we commit ourselves to, but it's not sustainable and will come tumbling down eventually.

Instead, a pivotal practice and reflection is to ask yourself **why** you feel a certain way. Understand what about you as a person, your personality, your views, and your beliefs etc. cause certain events in reality to elicit emotional responses within you.

If you are elated by something - What about you values that external thing so highly? 

If you are angered by something - What about you holds that external thing to be so harmful? 

When you can identify and understand what part of you links an event to a response, then you can actually do something about it. We don't get harmed by insults about appearance because appearance or insulting is naturally ""bad"" rather we get insulted because some part of us harbours insecurities or pride about our appearance. If we work to remove the insecurity and the pride, we remove the ability to be harmed by insults.

Yes, you can choose to ignore the angery that happens if someone insults you... But that anger will happen every time if you don't break the connection, and that person will still have power over your mind no matter how you externalise it.

It's not stoic to walk away from a situation going ""Man, I acted so stoicly, I didn't let my anger get me... I could have said so much back to them but I walked away"". If it truly didn't affect you, you wouldn't be thinking about how you had to control an external response.",Stoicism,1654505333.0,t3_v5yc8m,0.99,991
How to be stoic through my boyfriend’s suicide?,"Hi. I’m a teenage boy whose boyfriend killed himself four days ago. He was living in Nevada with his dad for school (I’m in Florida) and I was unable to attend his memorial/funeral service. Our relatives (strict religious people) didn’t know we were gay, just thought we were best friends. We hadn’t told our friends we were dating either. At the time we thought it was best to not tell anybody until we were both financially independent, but now nobody knows how much pain I’m in right now. I was gonna propose as soon as we graduated next fall.

I’m trying to be stoic through this. I know I provided him with love and support, and improved his quality of life (he struggled with depression his whole life). I know I did all I could for him. Today I brought flowers to a hiking trail we used to go on all the time. I said my goodbyes and that I would love him forever. 

But I still feel so empty. I burst into tears constantly which is unusual for me, though expected I guess. Everything reminds me of him.

I can be stoic. Today I stood my ground against an angry neighbor who threatened to punch me in the face.,"I actually, genuinely wasn't afraid. I knew him enough to know that if it comes to it, it won't be more than that punch which will heal. Also knowing it will be easy to get injury compensation from him helped that. As a side note: I didn't actively provoke him. He just can't stand me not assuming a position under him.  
I introduced the post with the statement I could be stoic when needed. So why do I want to kill myself? The past weeks I regularly thought it would make sense for me to cease existing. I am not prepared for all that life will throw at me. At the mere hint of stress my thoughts go back to drugs. I'm 25 and could never get an apprenticeship like 90% of people my age. Everyone says I'm so clever but this cleverness has done me nothing good so far. I am not cut out for what I will need to overcome to get a better life. Opening myself up to people, leading discussions, convincing someone of my person. I don't make an impression on anyone. I am forgettable.  
Please tell me what should be truly important in life for someone that has already picked up and applied stoic ideas. Tell me that all that society expects from is not important and inject some philosophy into my mind. I will absorb anything as I believe in stoicism and philosophy.

Hapiness is not a thing or a person. Happiness it is a choice that exists within us and Stoicism can help us realize it.,"I’m not sure why people believe Stoics to be emotionless but I find a lot of joy as a result of practicing it. I smile a lot more and am grateful for the things I have around me and no longer take them for granted. I think people have a misconception of happiness, that it’s some state of being in a constant high, (which i’ve experienced from doing drugs and buying material things. but i’ve learned pleasure is fleeting and the higher you climb the harder you drop). I’m close to one year in quarentine. When it started I felt I hit rock bottom, but now I feel like I’m living the dream. Guess what, nothing has changed much around me (people have actuallly grown more restless and stressed), the only thing that’s changed is my mindset. 

I definitely have my ups and downs and doubts like every human being, but practicing Stoicism has helped me to rebalance faster after each turbulance. For example, rejections from people and jobs sting (Im glad they sting bc it reminds me im human and not a robot), but after that sting I try to rationalize what’s occured. Did i do my best? I think i did, and thats enough, most of it was out of my control anyways. On to the next person or oppritunity. 

To be honest I feel a lot more free now and can now spend all this headspace filling it with more knowledge and trying to make the world around me a better place—another great thing I love about Stoicism. To me it seems pretty altruisitic bc one has a duty to others. It makes sense. I look to the natural world for inspriation. The bees do the duty of the bees and do it well. The trees do the duty of the trees and do it well. As a human being, I have several duties, and now I must learn to do them well.",Stoicism,1614188914.0,t3_lris2c,0.98,965

"Wake Up, Short Post On a Our Tragic Situation","News, social media, porn, YouTube, Netflix and overconsumption has stripped us of our ability to sustain attention, to feel deeply, and to connect to one another. It's 2020 and the world is swept away, more and more people, younger and younger, are being pulled into distraction-based-existence (DBE).

When the situation is seen for what it is, it’s heartbreaking. Anxiety, fear, anger, unrest are normalized. Men trapped in porn addiction, women trapped in image complexes, children having full blown addictions to screens. YouTube, Tik Tok and similar software companies, pay millions (probably way more) in research to entrap & sustain human awareness for *as long as possible*. And they succeed. For the sake of what? Profit.

If you love yourself; set your standards higher. And I mean *much* higher. Your society won't set them higher for you, your friends & family likely won't either. You have to do it for yourself, especially if you want to help others.

This is what I mean by ""*much* higher"":

Peace of Mind:

If you’re not completely peaceful in being alone, raise your standard. When I say peaceful, I truly mean peaceful. Most people may not even understand this. I'll elaborate.

You are content, you are not thinking of the past, or concerned about the future. In fact, you decide when you want to think, on your terms. Your thoughts aren’t randomly dragging you through the mud of fear, anxiety, worry. You direct your thoughts, and can simply stop cycles of thought when you wish.

This is unfathomable to most in society, yes, because it’s not their standard. Don’t follow their standard. Stop accepting the constant assault from your mind. If you love yourself, you’ll make this a priority. Train it. You’re gonna live in the mind for the rest of your life, maybe clean it up, especially before pointing out the mess in others.

Joy in Being:

Remember when you were a child, when you were just happy and engaged in the world for the sake of it? If you love yourself, make that your standard. You believe you lost that childlike wonder and joy, you haven’t, it’s there, trust me, you’ve just allowed your mind to turn into a dumping ground with the collective baggage. It isn’t even your fault, necessarily, don’t be so quick to blame yourself. Those around us simply do what they’ve learned from their society, family, and friends and teach us the best they’ve come up with to be happy. Unfortunately, the best they’ve come up with isn’t close to acceptable if you want stable joy.

You find joy in your work. In creating a beautiful future. You share this with others, and they recognize this rare quality in you. This is necessary if you want to be exceptionally helpful to those confused and in pain around you. The best way to help others is to first learn to help yourself.

Groundedness:

Your possessions will break. You will see friends / family die. Your body will fail you. You will find yourself tested over and over and over by life’s difficulties. But you learn to stay rooted in a stable ship of peace. Even when all the above happen, you’ll be able to support those in less stable minds. You can support your family when there is a death. You become a pillar in society by being a noble example.

This isn’t a somber acceptance of the harshness of reality, but the result of honest reflection of how things are. When the nature of reality is seen for what it is, you recognize the immaturity of engaging in war against it.

You learn to let experiences come and go. They’d do that regardless, and you know this. This is not a cold state, it is a wise state. It’s a mature state. It’s the only state that is aligned with the flow of reality. And when you do this, you begin to realize the value was never in the passing world anyway, it was something deeper within the whole time.

It’s time to wake up, you’re ready when you say you are, stop waiting to say you are. The standard of society, social media, friends, family, is not enough. Give yourself a chance to be peaceful, joyful, grounded. You’re mind isn’t a dumping ground, treat it like the most valuable tool you have and you’ll find that it is. This will be the best decision you make in your life.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading and here's a final post script... Message me if you’d like to join a group that will be a support structure for those sincere & serious about this.

My cat of 17 years died today,"We got him when I was a child. Now he leaves as I head off to grad school. I was his chosen human, so to speak, and I'm immensely grateful to have been that.

I was the only one home who could have brought him to the emergency vet, but I wouldn't have been able to live with myself had I let someone else go in my place once we got the call that he would need to be put to sleep. I couldn't bear the thought of someone else he wasn't as comfortable being with him at the end, nor him being put down alone, amongst strangers in a place he hated and was confused by.

Tears wouldn't stop emerging. I spent half an hour comforting him and petting him, trying to make him feel a bit more comfortable and secure. I held him in my arms at the end, and I heard him purring before the sedative kicked in. I hope he felt safe and loved, and I'm glad he's not suffering anymore.

The only reason I post this here is because I'm grateful for Stoicism in helping me through this. When I was younger, our dog died, and I was too emotional to even go with her to the vet. I always regretted that, though I don't hold it against myself anymore. Practicing Stoicism has helped me actualize doing what I know must be done. I had recognized when he became sick that it was a likely event. I rationalized myself through it and, though I was immensely sad, I kept my mind clear and worked toward getting him the help he needed. I had already come to terms with it. I had the strength to be there for him, to help him through the end of his life.

He was a constant companion and a close friend, always at my side. [And he was quite the stoic himself.](https://i.imgur.com/GwKwcFb.jpg)

It finally clicked for me today that I can't control other people's emotional suffering. I can only choose my own actions.,"Today I had a brief interaction with a man that seemed to be experiencing feelings of resentment and bitterness towards women. He was my barista at Starbucks and it was basically impossible to say anything to help him feel better while ordering coffee. In the past I would have felt like I should have somehow helped but that I failed.

But after this interaction, it dawned on me that I cannot control other people's suffering. Doing good does not mean I am responsible for reducing other people's experiences of suffering. I must focus on choosing my own good actions and letting go of the rest.

I thought that being virtuous meant being for others the person no one was for me in my time of need. I used to feel a special responsibility towards these kinds of bitter men because I am a woman. I used to see my responsibility to act virtuously as a responsibility to alleviate suffering in others.

But that way of thinking is wrong. I can't control other people's suffering. I can only demonstrate the kind of person I am by choosing my actions. I have to accept that sometimes people will suffer no matter how good a person I am. I cannot control their feelings. I can only control my own actions and live with integrity.",Stoicism,1620359389.0,t3_n6pmq9,0.99,951

You're Owed Nothing,"We embark in this journey of self-development and we feel the sweet feeling of a fresh beginning, fresh opportunities waiting to come. We grind day in and day out. We have a fucking blast putting ourselves under pressure.

But there is a problem.

We become entitled.

We think that, because of our work, we deserve things. We think that because of our effort, we should receive something, be it money or a certain type of treatment. Put simply, we establish a covert contract with life: ""If I do x, life will give me the y I want"", and we operate with that lens.

And we get fucked over. And rightly so.

In no way are you guaranteed or owed results because of your effort. There are simply the mechanics of life: you do certain things that increase the likelihood of you reaching your desired outcome and others that push you away from it. You can do everything that diminishes the chances of you getting what you want and still get it, whilst in some other domain the opposite might occur.

Understand this: the process of going from goal to goal and seeing yourself develop skills throughout your life is the joy. The getting or not is just the frosting of the cake: it makes everything better still, but you're good either way. If you go through life with unspoken expectations put over it, you'll suffer. And you thinking that if you do x, then you deserve y is an expectation. A dangerous one. You'll live angry, frustrated at life.

Don't get me wrong, you can have desires and you can do things in order to have certain results. But be careful not to feel like you deserve those results, just because you worked. Feeling like you deserve stuff is one way in which you throw your judgements into reality. And the things you add to reality are not part of it. Always remember:

>“If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.” *―* ***Marcus Aurelius,*** *Meditations*

"Very stoic passage from ""How To Win Friends and Influence People"" by Dale Carnegie","""Everybody in the world is seeking happiness—and there is one sure way to find it. That is by controlling your thoughts. Happiness doesn’t depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner conditions.
It isn’t what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about it. For example, two people may be in the same place, doing the same thing; both may have about an equal amount of money and prestige—and yet one may be miserable and the other happy. Why? Because of a different mental attitude. I have seen just as many happy faces among the poor peasants toiling with their primitive tools in the devastating heat of the tropics as I have seen in air-conditioned offices in New York, Chicago or Los Angeles.

Don’t Carry the Mountains You’ve Climbed,"One of my professors for one of my first engineering courses felt it was necessary to educate my class on the two types of fun. The first fun is straight up fun. The ice-cream for dinner kind of fun; the kind of fun that is fun from start to end but doesn’t stick around once it’s over. So it’s best enjoyed while one has it as it might never materialize as a defining memory in one’s identity. And then there’s the second.

The second kind of fun must be endured. It’s all journey and no destination for longer than we may like it. It’s breaking one’s leg and continuing to hike up the mountain because the view is worth it. But man, is that view really something! Based on the grin on my professor’s face, I didn’t need clarification which type of fun the class would be.

In life, everyone constantly hikes up figurative mountains whether they want to or not. Everyone isn’t just hiking up one mountain at a time either, but they’re actually scaling multiple at once and each mountain differs greatly. Some mountains have dense jungles with mosquitos the size of your fist that suck one’s energy. Some are barren rock without cover from the scorching sun that progressively gets more painful the longer one’s on it. Some mountains are blanketed in snow that not only slows us down, making the summit feel distant, but because fresh snow falls on our foot prints, we can’t even back trace. And then some mountains have an oasis on their peaks with delicious fruit, but as we are ejecting the contents of our stomach we realize the cloud that obscured the true height of the mountain has disappeared, and we must now continue our expedition with food poisoning.

While there are two types of fun, there are an infinite number of unique mountains. Unfortunately, if we don’t turn around at any point while scaling the mountain, type two fun will never feel fun. If we only focus on our hardships instead of the beauty in the process, we surrender any reward we could have gained.

A reality for many is that they are unable to get off the mountain even after they’ve successfully reached its end. Not because they are in awe of the view, but because they let the obstacles they face torture their souls. Face down in the dirt, these people carry the weight of the mountains themselves on their brittle bones leading to suffocation and depression.

Thankfully, these people can be saved – I know because I was one of them at one point in my life.

In college, my mountains were mostly career and dating-life related. They were filled with lonely days and sleepless nights until finally the giant boulder that blocked my path to the top of the mountain slid off the mountain face on one stormy night that I thought would bury me in mud. I’m not sure I can give specific strategies for a successful summit for every mountain, but mountains are guaranteed to change while we traverse them. Patience is the most valuable tool one can put in one’s hiking backpack besides sunscreen to ensure one gets a profile picture worthy view.

More recently, I burned myself out at a job I had for just under a year. It was an all-consuming expedition up a mountain that actually turned out to be a volcano after it exploded, and left me searching for not just a new job but a new identity. Unable to see past the ash cloud that blocked the view and unable to get to the higher ground due to the molten lava expunging from the crater at the top, I was defeated.

My friends and family all assured me I would succeed as I would have in the past, but I had serious doubts. I felt like an imposter who reached the summits of my previous mountains not through skill, but luck. I went to open my backpack to see what tools I had been using and only saw bubble wrap and glitter that served no purpose other than take up space and make a mess. Game over.

Months went by and while the ash cloud lingered, the lava hardened into obsidian, forming impenetrable walls that I could still not scale. I would never get to see a product I engineered be brought to market while working with my team.

Descending the volcano, I reached the trail head and noticed an adjacent path – a fork in the road so to speak. Soon the scorched earth at the base transitioned to lush foliage as I gained elevation. The creatures I encountered were incredibly friendly and once I learned they quite enjoyed eating glitter, they let me ride them to the top. Hopping off my valiant-but-figurative beast of burden, I came to the top of a waterfall. Unrolling my bubble wrap, I sat atop the improvised floatation device and made my way to the edge. The fury of the water crashing against the rocks at the bottom of the mountain pushed the ashy cloud out of view and I could finally see: what it’s like to lead development for a product being brought to market.

I can’t say we always make the best decisions on the trail or that we can summit all mountains. And I can’t say that we will always get to see the view from the top.

But I can say that if we remain patient with ourselves to not give up, we have the best chance of getting to the top. And if we forgive ourselves when we can go no further due to depression, anger, grief, and guilt we leave the weight of the mountain at the trailhead. And finally, if we stay willing to keep climbing new mountains, we will live a beautiful life.

“No expert needs validation from an amateur.” — Epictetus,"This Epictetus says in Book 2 of Discourses, chapter 13 titled ‘On nerves’.

And I think this is so profound because often the reason behind our anxiety is our concern with other people’s opinion of us. And this realization, that if you know your craft you need not be concerned with what people think about you, will help us be more confident with regards to external circumstances.

Of course, this won’t eliminate those feelings at once, practice is essential. And it’s not even required that you have to practice those by actually facing those situations. Although you should if you have the opportunity to do so, most of the time you won’t have those things available to you. By ‘those things’, I mean speaking in public, talking to strangers, meeting someone ‘important’, and so on.

This can even be applied in the digital world. Many people have good things to share, but they don’t due to fear of criticism and so on—on YouTube, on a Blog, etc. Only if they overcome that fear and do those things, the world can actually benefit from their work.

Fear, as Seneca (I think) said, is caused by ignorance. ’Ignorance of what?’, you may ask. Ignorance...

* that people really don’t care about what we do as much as we think they do; 
* that if we know our craft better than them, we need not be afraid of their opinions because why should an expert be afraid of what amateurs say; 
* that they will criticize you even if you were a Sage; 
* and that what people think of you is not in your control so you need not be concerned about their opinions. 

Epictetus explained this with the example of Zeno, the founder of our school, which will clarify the point further:

“All of which explains why Zeno was not nervous about his meeting with Antigonus. What Zeno valued Antigonus had no power over, and as a philosopher he cared nothing for the things that the king did command. It was Antigonus who was anxious before their meeting. Naturally—he wanted to make a good impression, which was beyond his control. Zeno, for his part, had no wish to please the king; no expert needs validation from an amateur.”",Stoicism,1613277736.0,t3_ljhhzy,0.99,936

"I'm surprised at how much useful ground is covered by the phrase ""don't cling""","Resentment and frustration are the feelings of holding to a failed expectation. Don't cling to them. 

Vanity and greed are the desires for things that we overvalue. Fear, anxiety, and anger are the feelings of concern that we might lose something that we overvalue. Don't cling to these things.

Argument is the result of overvaluing the results of our judgement and preferences. Don't cling to them.

Vice is false belief, and we can hold on to our mistaken beliefs very tightly. Don't cling to them.

I have been entertaining myself for the last day or so with the following exercise: whenever I become aware of some small distress, I try to explain this distress in terms of my clinging to something that I shouldn't. So far I've yet to encounter something that couldn't be usefully described this way.

Most of the time, these minor distresses are caused by unwelcome surprises, which is just another way of saying ""by failed expectations"". Damn, we're out of tuna. My view of reality was wrong, and it just got corrected. It hurts exactly to the extent that I hold on to the old, flawed version. If I knew all along we were out of tuna, there would be no distress at all.

Sometimes the minor distresses are anxieties; dreading an annoying task ahead, for example. Of course it's not an annoying task, it's not even a task, _it's the thing I choose to do_, but I am seeing it in this crazy hurtful way because I overvalue my routine and I cling to it.

Sometimes my distresses are physical discomforts, poor sleep, aches and pains. If things had been ten times worse all week, this level of discomfort would be a welcome relief! It only feels bad because I'm comparing it to a level of comfort I once knew, and am clinging to, as if perpetual enjoyment of a 20 year old body were a god-given birthright or something.

"How noble and good everyone could be if, every evening before falling asleep, they were to recall to their minds the events of the while day and consider exactly what has been good and bad. Then, without realizing it you try to improve yourself at the start of each new day"" Anne Frank","""People who have a religion should be glad, for not everyone has the gift of believing in heavenly things. You don't necessarily even have to be afraid of punishment after death; purgatory, hell, and heaven are things that a lot of people can't accept, but still a religion, it doesn't matter which, keeps a person on the right path. It isn't the fear of God but the upholding of one's own honor and conscience. How noble and good everyone could be if, every evening before falling asleep, they were to recall to their minds the events of the while day and consider exactly what has been good and bad.

I was high and was going to kill myself after I took an uber to a prostitutes home. I entered the home and realized immediately I didn't want to be there. I apologized and walked out. the escort texted me my real name and that they know who I am She (a transfemale) said that I should come back, that I didn't pay. I felt threatened but I panicked and went back in. She insisted we go into the room and I complimented her on her looks (she could probably tell I was trying to save face) and said I am sorry but now that I am here I am not interested but I was scared because she knew my name ( I did not admit this to her) so I gave her the money. She then said she feels threatened and that I should leave. I immediately walked out. I called my older brother crying and begging for help. He rushed over and brought me home. The first step needed for me is sobriety. I hate how I let him and myself down. I have lost years of my life to this.

I cried to my brother he cried to me. Said how his life and my mothers life would be ruined if I ever hurt myself. He wants to help me be sober. I was on such a good path last few weeks and right when things get better I start using again and fuck everything up. That was my rock bottom.

Seneca - On The Shortness of Life,"# Life is short if you waste it on trivialities.

People have always been good at wasting time. Most people spend the majority of their time engaged in trivial activities – even if these activities don’t seem trivial to them.

But the thing about trivial activities is that they make life seem short. For instance, life will seem especially short if you only pursue status or power. You’ll always have your eye on some future goal and won’t be able to enjoy your current situation.

People tend to think that, once they’ve achieved all their goals, they’ll have time to enjoy life. But it rarely works out this way. What usually happens is this: people spend their life *preparing* for life.

The Emperor Augustus is a case in point. He spoke endlessly of quietude, of the calm and rest he’d enjoy upon retirement from his public duties. But this longed-for day never came. The Roman Empire depended on him, and he could never pull himself away.

Life will also seem short to those who pursue a life of luxury. These people can't even enjoy their indulgences. They’ll always be thinking of how their current thrill will soon end, or where their next one will come from.

But worst of all are those who seek glory after death. These people get wrapped up in planning for a posterity that’s not even theirs. They'll be thinking of that pithy remark in their obituary. Or they’ll draw up plans for giant tombs. But funerals ought to be simple symbolic affairs. In fact, there is nothing more suitable than a single burning candle, an apt symbol for the shortness of human life. 

# Busyness doesn’t equal fulfillment.

Say a ship left port and spent the next year being thrown about by a mighty storm. It would be inaccurate to claim that, during this time, it had steered a successful and purposeful course, even if it did make it safely back to harbor. Well, the same can be said of life.

Pitching, rolling and yawing aren’t substitutes for living. Of course, it’s important to plot a course and then stick to it, but it’s also worth remembering that not every path should be pursued.

Some people are happy to spend their lives tacking and jibing through the wind, constantly changing direction. They worry they’re not headed in the right direction and they pine for what they’ve left behind.

Other people, through sheer apathy, are happy to be buffeted about by the waves. They only stop drifting when they are too tired or too old to carry on.

And then there are those who devote their prime years to lust, greed and gluttony. They keep telling themselves that, someday, they’ll amend their ways – but they never do.

For some, by the time they feel that the moment is right, they’re too old or too weak to change their habits. For others, even if they could prolong their lives threefold, they still wouldn't change.

Worst of all, however, is to be borne away on the winds of somebody else’s preoccupations.

It’s pointless working for someone whose aims and convictions don’t agree with your own. Doing so is the surest path to a short life. When this happens, your obsessions and worries won’t even be your own, and you’re destined to run aground.

When stuck in such a situation, people moan that their boss or supervisor doesn’t listen to their wishes or opinions. But if these people can’t find the time to listen to *themselves* and pursue their own courses, why should anybody else? 

# You can choose to be educated by the world’s greatest minds.

While you have little power to change who raised you or who you were raised with, the fact remains that you can forge your own path in education and self-improvement.

It’s astonishingly easy to acquire wisdom from great thinkers and, in time, to train yourself to be a better person. You can, for example, engage with the works of Plato or Hegel, Derrida or Arendt, and come to a better understanding of people, power, society and culture.

Pick your philosopher, and discover new ways to tackle life, from the everyday trifles to universal preoccupations. A great thinker can be both a solace and a companion.

What’s even better is that they’re always available. You can engage with such thinkers on a daily basis, and they’ll speak truth every time, pointing out your attributes, both negative and positive, without sugarcoating things.

And when you’re done, you can just set them back on the shelf. They’re not going to sap your energy as real people might.

Furthermore, because this mental engagement will only have positive effects, these thinkers will prolong your life rather than shorten it. And even if you’re nearing the end of life, reading is still a boon, for by reading you can learn not only how to live but how to face death unflinchingly.

However, you have to be careful when selecting which great minds to read and what you will glean from them. There’s no point reading just to compile trivial facts; you have to educate yourself purposefully. Life is long enough to devote yourself to self-knowledge and true wisdom. The great minds are your torchbearers in this task. 

# True satisfaction springs from within.

In life, we often experience ephemeral sensations that may temporarily perk us up, but they are not within our control, and the pleasure they engender often vanishes as quickly as it appears.

A wise person is self-reliant and independent. The loss of status or money is no real setback to him, since his sense of self is not founded on external circumstances.

Once you find yourself motivated by greed instead of necessity, you will remain forever impoverished.

The surest path to true satisfaction is to conduct yourself within your means and to appreciate your lot in life. This way, you will never feel that you’re lacking anything. The instant you start to covet unnecessary material items, however, you will feel that you are stuck in a sort of poverty.

To use an analogy: if you crave water not because you're thirsty but because you’re feverish, your craving will never be satisfied. Such a craving is not necessity; it’s sickness.

This holds just as true for possessions and power as it does for water and food, or pretty much any desire you can think of.

It all boils down to this: the important things in life can’t be removed or diminished by others. It’s simply not within the capacity of a mere mortal to rob you of your critical faculties or to eradicate your ability to appreciate the beauty of the mountains or the sea.

No matter where you are or what you are doing, whether in exile or in your homeland, whether ill or well, know this: you may always survey the heavens and contemplate the most profound aspects of existence.

So remember: self-worth comes from within. Only you can determine how satisfied you are with the world around you. 

# To ensure a tranquil mind, tailor your career to your personality and don’t forget to enjoy yourself!

There is no point whatsoever in having what appears to be an enviable life when you’re actually fractured inside. A life filled with doubts and regrets is no life at all. So what should you do?

The first thing to realize is that there is no one path that will ensure tranquility. We must each forge our own. For instance, some people are more suited to a life of study and reflection. Others might need sustained physical exertion to be contented.

But no matter how you conduct your life, be sure to serve mankind with actions, writing or your intellect – at least, to the best of your abilities.

You won’t gain anything by taking on tasks to which you are ill suited. Accept only those enterprises that you are sure you will finish.

Have faith in yourself. Trust your instincts. And don’t be too harsh on yourself once you have selected your course. You will enjoy the journey all the more if you have confidence in yourself and your actions.

The second thing to remember is that overexertion will smother your faculties and sap your spirit. In short, don’t overdo it. You wouldn’t incessantly till the soil and expect a cornucopia every time. So don’t always work your fingers to the bone. Ultimately, it’s just counterproductive.

Instead, set aside some time for yourself. Relax. Even Cato, the famous Roman, used to drink a glass of wine when he returned home from a long day of statesmanly activity. And Socrates, when he wasn’t philosophizing, enjoyed playing with the local children.

So don’t forget the value of pleasure, and don’t think you shouldn’t enjoy yourself.

Moderation is the best policy. Some possessions and leisure pursuits may help you relax, but don’t overindulge. Material objects and external pursuits shouldn’t define your happiness.",Stoicism,1613150452.0,t3_lifqdh,0.99,907

                Repetition is the key to success. No where is this truer than our thoughts. We can create a successful environment for ourselves when we work with ourselves and not against ourselves. Whether creating a reminder on our phone to stand an extra five minutes each hour, to set a goal every day to write 500 words towards our first novel, or anything other achievement we strive for.

                It begins with our thoughts. If we feed the good thoughts, we grow the pathways in our minds that will help to get us where we need to go. While if we continue to dig the same hole that we wish to get out of we will only sink deeper into the same thought processes that keep us where we’re at.

                As Marcus Aurelius wrote, “for the soul becomes dyed with the colour of its thoughts.” You have it within yourself to masters your thoughts. It just takes practice, repletion, and above all cultivating the will you need to get where you need to go.

Having said that, however, I don't think one can argue with the truth of this statement (taken out of context though it may be), when looked at from a Stoic perspective. What I think is most interesting and relevant here is that a concept that is so central to Stoicism is being expressed in a completely different context.

You Must Read To Lead,"From ""The Daily Stoic"" email list:

---

Many “smart” people aren’t actually smart. They just know a lot of trivia. Sure, they can tell you all sorts of facts, they have a library of big thick books filled with enormous words, or they can give you the up-to-the-minute news about a political race. But can they tell you what any of this means? Do they do anything important with this information? Of course not.

And these types have always existed. Seneca spoke critically of literary snobs who could speculate for hours about whether The Iliad or The Odyssey was written first, or who the real author was (a debate that rages on today). He disliked hearing people chatter about which Roman general did this or that first, or which received this or that honor. “Far too many good brains,” he said, “have been afflicted by the pointless enthusiasm for useless knowledge.”

Harry Truman famously said that not all all readers are leaders but all leader are readers—they have to be. And they certainly aren’t reading to impress people or for the mental gymnastics. It’s to get better! It’s to find things they can use. Not at the dinner table or on Twitter, but in their real lives.

The same must be true to us. We have to learn how to read to be better leaders, better people, better citizens. We must learn how to read for our own benefit—and so that we might have aid to offer to a friend in pain, or a soul in crisis. Seneca’s point was that only knowledge that does us good is worth knowing. Everything else is trivia.

"If today is not my day, it means I can make tomorrow my own.","Earlier I had a realisation. As 2020 is coming to an end, my friends are going for a trek at Himalayas. I too wanted to go. But it's costing me about ₹30,000 (Roughly 400 USD).

At this point, I cannot afford to spend that much amount for a 5 days trip as I am saving money to make capital for my startup company.

So, instead I joined gym earlier this evening and just returned from my first ever work out in long years. I decided, I'm gonna make more money in coming months and then I'll go for the trek. By that time, I'll be in better shape with good stamina that can help me enjoy the trek even better.

"""Remind yourself that your task is to be a good human being; remind yourself what nature demands of people. Then do it, without hesitation, and speak the truth as you see it. But with kindness. With humility. Without hypocrisy.” Marcus Aurelius (Meditations, Book 8, Section 5)","“The first step: Don’t be anxious. Nature controls it all. And before long you’ll be no one, nowhere—like Hadrian, like Augustus.

The second step: Concentrate on what you have to do. Fix your eyes on it. Remind yourself that your task is to be a good human being; remind yourself what nature demands of people. Then do it, without hesitation, and speak the truth as you see it. But with kindness. With humility. Without hypocrisy.”

Marcus Aurelius (Meditations, Book 8, Section 5)

Remembering that one day there will be an end can seem like a morbid topic to bring about in discussion with your friends. But it’s a reality that meets us whether we choose to think about it or not. I am not saying live everyday like your last, but I also am. Marcus Aurelius wrote, “The first step: Don’t be anxious. Nature controls it all. And before long you’ll be no one, nowhere—like Hadrian, like Augustus.” Not being anxious of the end, but cognizant of its existence in our life. Once you’ve accepted the truth you can move forward. 

But, in it all living the best life I can being kind, thoughtful, and above all working towards my goals wherever my life takes me I will be happy that I chose the path that I did. 

To meet my goals, “Concentrate on what you have to do,” staying focused on my path, and if I cannot help others leaving them be. Not being distracted my extrinsic forces that do nothing for me, but distract me for my ultimate goals.

Above all as I move about life acting and speaking with, “kindness. With humility. Without hypocrisy.” Doing my best to live life in moderation, and bringing impactful good to myself and those around me.

Accept the role of being a conscious part of a vast cosmos whose depths are infinite. A cosmos from which you emerged and will return to be part of it's glory.

Laugh at the mystery of life, all it's intrigues, beauty, chaos and seeming purposelessness.

"Fellow thinkers, life is beautiful when you do what you've to do.","I'm going through a rough patch right now. My dad is sick, all my money is going to his expenses, my country is against me since economy is sinking and taking us with it, I don't have the choice to leave nor change the outcomes.

I've also criticized a lot having to be responsible of my dad, since I think he's the culprit of a lot of my sorrows as a child. But it's all about perspective, and my perspective right now is that I'm strong.

Life is not a sprint,"Life is not a sprint, we are usually unsatisfied with what our life is, and we compare ourselves to other more successful people, constantly looking to the future potential of what our lives could be. The reality is that we always live in the present, and we should not compare ourselves to others, but rather focus on improving ourselves both **mentally** and **physically**.

It is hard since we are surrounded by a culture that convinces us that the more stuff we have and the more popular we are, the happier we will be. It is true that material stuff brings us happiness, but it is a trap. It gives us short term pleasure and a desire for more material, an insatiable desire that cannot be quenched since we want more and more.

The stuff we frequently chase in life reveal to be rather petty and insignificant in the grand scheme of things. We must define our happiness not by what we own or achieve and not by others see us as, but by **how we think**, **how we view ourselves**, and **how we live our life** through our virtues.

And this can be attained by accepting reality as it is, being indifferent to what we cannot control and pursuing our own self-improvement. To Stoicism, this is how we remain happy and satisfied with ourselves.",Stoicism,1599910922.0,t3_irb3gz,0.99,876
Only one person came to my meal,"Hosted a birthday meal a few days ago with work colleagues, only one person turned up to it out of a possible 20. Some people had their excuses, others didn’t say whether they would come or not, others said yes but then never showed up, others only told me afterwards why they didn’t come. The one person who showed up didn’t judge me or make me feel weird about it.

A few years ago, that would have made me really sad and sent me down a spiral of shame and self-loathing. But I just felt happy that one person turned up. If that person hadn’t turned up, I still would have eaten.

Just felt like sharing this positivity! It feels good to have confidence in myself, and I would be more than happy to host something else and be like ‘I’m having this meal on this day at this time, come or don’t come, I’m enjoying myself either way’.

Edit: I was planning to bring in chocolates to work for my birthday, now I’m not so sure if I should, lol.

Edit: thanks for the gold and silver, kind people! I’ve got to admit I’m a *little* bit salty towards the people who said they would definitely come but then never showed or said sorry. These same people constantly ask me for favours at work!

The realization of choice has changed my entire life,"One of the key tenants of Stoicism is that we should focus on what we CAN control. To be honest, I think people truly underestimate just how much we control and how much choice in the matter we have.

I read that Victor Frankl quote“**Between stimulus and response there is a space.** **In that space is our power to choose our response.** **In our response lies our growth and our freedom.”**

Throughout my day I can catch myself feeling that initial response to stimulus.

Something bad happens - my knee-jerk response is often very negative. I got chewed out at work the other day over something that wasn't my fault and my initial feelings were anger, and an IMMEDIATE need to defend my ego. Then I stopped for a second, took a breath, and realized that misunderstandings happen and it's a small moment in time that will pass. Then I moved on. My day was not ruined. Had I dwelled on this and chose to get dragged into hell by my initial emotion, I likely would have had a super shitty day and potentially a bad WEEK.

I've stopped worrying about things with this mindset. If something bad is going to happen in the future, it will simply happen, and I will respond to it with calm acceptance and do my best with what I can control.

I used to feel lots of resentment and envy towards people, and that has stopped too. I feel myself having those thoughts....stop for a second, then realize that envy and resentment get me nowhere and at the end of the day I want others to be happy and fulfilled. So how does envy and resentment even make sense? Then it immediately dissipates.

My life is just....so much better because of this philosophy. It's not a philosophy to me, it's a daily practice. Just thought I would share that. I love hearing success stories so I thought I would share mine.",Stoicism,1658194048.0,t3_w2g0vz,1.0,869

"""Do you even exist'?","A little over a month or 2 ago I decided to permanently delete all of my social media (Facebook, Instagram, etc.) I was essentially deleting everything where I was trying to make my life seem amazing to other people. Anyways I am talking to this girl, and things are going decent I'd say, then she asks me 

&#x200B;

Her: ""Hey, do you have instagram"" 

To which I reply

Me: ""Nah sorry""

Her: ""well, do you have facebook?""

Me: ""Don't have that either""

keep in mind, the question she then asks isn't along the lines of ""well how do you keep up to date with your friends"" or ""how do you let people know whats going on with you""

She asks me this

Her: ""Do you even exist?"" 

As a joke I say

Me: ""I think, therefore I am""

and we just joke a little bit, and that was all

But it struck a nerve with me, some people are truly not living, they live behind what they project, and once you take that wall down, they cease to have any meaning, their friends, lovers, personality, humour, style, skills.... all so fragile that they need to keep it up for all to see. Social media gives this false confidence to a lot of people and rewards impulsivity. 

&#x200B;

While her question was an attempt at humour I am sure, she was still quite shocked and I feel like her response was somewhat genuine. 

&#x200B;

But we are the ones who truly know we exist, and we do the most with it, we do not care what happens when we die so why should I leave behind some meaningless collection of myself that I know was merely based off how others viewed me and not how I viewed myself, because I couldn't discover who I was.",Stoicism,1598589660.0,t3_ii0px0,0.96,870

This has affected my ability to concentrate and taking the easy way out of much of my challenges the past few years.

The past few months, I've noticed it escalating and hence have been trying to combat it to varying affect. Just like the deep-rooted uncomfortability and unhappiness I feel wasn't made in a day nor can I really break it down and squash it in a day but I'm trying. 

I noticed one thing, that when I tried convincing myself I was sad and feeling pity for myself that it was self-fulfilling prophecy. Nor is trying to force myself into a false sense of happiness a real fix for the issue either. What I've noticed really works is a ""blank"" open mindset, not really being fixated on one thing but open, open to new ideas/experiences and accepting that things are beyond my control but I can accept to control how I react to them instead of them controlling me.


A dependence on the future and an absence of flux only seems to put you on the loop of ""I feel unhappy"" therefore ""I must be unhappy"".

"Stoicism is not about ""dealing with emotions""","I can't help but notice that the idea that Stoicism is about ""dealing with emotions"" (mainly in the form of suppressing them) is taken from Star Trek, specifically the character of Mr Spock. It's an oddity that more people seem to believe in this interpretation over the interpretations of actual Stoic philosophers.

Here are some things that are completely specific to Mr Spock, and have nothing to do with Stoicism

* suppressing emotions
* separating emotions from ""thinking""
* ignoring emotions
* acting in spite of emotions
* disregarding emotions

Stoics predate the unusual modern pretension that says ""I want to believe something negative, yet experience positive emotions in the scenario where that belief applies"". Many posts on this forum are of the following form, and they all contain this error:

* I have formed the belief that I hate my parents. How can I feel calm around my parents?
* I have formed the belief that I must date my friend, and if she rejects me I will never be happy. How can I not fear her rejecting me?
* I have formed the belief that not to pass my exam would devastate my life. How can I stop worrying about passing this exam?
* I have formed the belief that money is the most important thing. How can I stop feeling inadequate when a person is wealthier than me?
* I have formed the belief that my friends are betraying me. How can I stop feeling angry and anxious around my friends?

Of course people do not word these posts with such self-awareness. A good example of this phenomenon is the recent post...

""I ordered an item I've been excited to receive this April, and it's been delayed to late July. What techniques can I use to stop feeling so sad about the delay?"".

What you see here is ""I have formed the belief that I am being deprived of fun. How can I not feel as though I am missing out on fun?"". In this example you can see the inverted relationship between an emotion and a belief. The poster completely discounts the possibility that the emotion came from a belief, or that this belief could be altered so that he did not have this emotional response, and so simply asks ""how can I hold this belief yet not experience the emotions appropriate to a person with this belief?"".

Emotions do not occur *then we form beliefs about them -* we form beliefs and then we experience those beliefs as emotions. When you are experiencing an emotion, *that is you experiencing your belief in that situation*. If you are in a boxing match, and you believe you will win easily, you will experience that belief as the emotion of confidence. If you believe you are going to be beaten badly, you will experience that belief as the emotion of fear.

The easiest way to completely misunderstand Stoicism is to take ""Spock Logic"", which is ""have emotion, then use mental techniques to suppress it"" and try to apply it to the philosophy. Stoic philosophers had not seen Star Trek, and so they thought completely correctly about emotions - they implicitly assume the correct position, which is that you will experience emotions consistent with your beliefs in any given scenario.

Read the following passage from Epictetus, and look how obvious this implicit assumption is:

>Men are disturbed, not by things, but by the principles and notions which they form concerning things. Death, for instance, is not terrible, else it would have appeared so to Socrates. But the terror consists in our notion of death that it is terrible. When therefore we are hindered, or disturbed, or grieved, let us never attribute it to others, but to ourselves; that is, to our own principles. An uninstructed person will lay the fault of his own bad condition upon others. Someone just starting instruction will lay the fault on himself. Some who is perfectly instructed will place blame neither on others nor on himself.

There are no ""techniques"" here, no ""tricks"", nothing to occur *after* an emotion is experienced. Throughout the work of the philosophers there is just one relentless, obvious and intuitive assumption - that your beliefs dictate your emotional experience, and that if you want a different emotional experience then the hard study and practice of philosophy is required.

Once you've begun experiencing a negative emotion, you've already failed - you've arrived in a situation for which you were unprepared, and you've experienced the negative emotions that are the outcome of being unprepared. If you find yourself in a situation that you have not prepared for, you cannot ""quickly do all the preparation"" after the situation has begun occurring. This is like arranging to play a guitar solo in front of an audience of people, arriving at the venue, standing on stage with your guitar, and then saying ""can somebody quickly show me how to play guitar, for I've found myself in a situation that requires it!"".",Stoicism,1624293012.0,t3_o4z5oz,0.97,874

How to stop being the slave of own desires. Use these 5 laws to finally see how your desires fuck you over,"Hey fellows,

We've all been there. Pursuing someone who didn't seem to share the same feelings. Looking forward to the precise moment of achieving our long desired goals, only to realise that the very process of achieving them was much more satisfactory than the achievment itself. Saving money to buy a new fancy cloth just to find out that it lost its shine as soon as you got accustomed to it. Imaginative power of strong desires creates an illusion that their fulfillment is all we need.

Stoicism views most of self-inflicted sufferings as driven by those illusions of our mind. Stoics acknowledged and examined such irrational, destructive tendencies of the mind that each of us has observed in ourselves and others. Lust or exessive desire is one of them.

Lust is an irrational desire or pursuit of an expected good. The Stoics divided rational and irrational desires based on their ""natural"" or ""unnatural"" character. We, as human beings, have two kinds of needs. Some of them have natural limits. These desires are finite and can be fully satisfied with relative ease. They can recur, so the satisfaction isn't permanent. But the measure of them is transparent and sustainable. We desire to eat until we aren't hungry, desire to drink until we aren't thirsty. The same thing that satisfied us yesterday can do it today too.

Other needs, such as the wish for status, wealth, or fame, are the product of our social environment that stimulates the desire for things that we don't actually need. Remember the last time you bought that sexy pair of sneakers because you thought it would make you look fabulous. Desires of this artificial kind are never quite satisfying. Because they aren't linked to a particular need, they have no natural limits. Their fulfillment isn't as pleasing as we imagined, and we must always pursue newer and bigger objects.

**There are mainly five ways in which unnatural desires give us empty promises:**

1. **We're never satisfied with what we have and always want more.** The Stoics observed that getting what we want never feels as good as we imagined it. This only makes us want more. New desires appear and replace those that are already fulfilled. Our minds seem to have a desire for desire itself and buy into the illusion that fulfilling a desire will bring us to an endpoint. However, the end never arrives, and this cycle starts all over again.
2. **We most desire what we do not or cannot have.** By some perverse force within us, the more distant and unattainable the object is, the greater is our desire to have it. We've all been there. As soon as someone we liked started pulling away, it only made us want them stronger.
3. **Pursuit of a thing is more pleasing than the possession of it.** Another deception identified by the Stoics: when we work toward a goal, we imagine the happiness that its attainment will bring. But the pursuit itself turns out to be more enjoyable than the capture of the thing pursued.
4. **Possession of a thing and familiarity with it tend to produce indifference or disgust.** By nature, we humans are not easily contented with our circumstances. By nature, the moment we possess something or get what we want, our minds begin to drift toward something new and different, to imagine we can have better. Possessing a thing tends to bring about indifference towards it.
5. **We mismeasure the value of what we have or don't have by comparing it to our expectations or others' possessions.** Fulfillment of our desires fails to satisfy in part because we measure our satisfaction with what we have by comparing it to what others have. It is always possible to find some who seem to be ahead of us or to have more than us, and those tend to be the only comparisons we care about. Everyone can be envious of somebody – if not of one who is achieving more, then of one who is achieving something else.

**Being aware of these biases, always ask yourself whether the object of pursuit is really worth it? Is it useful for your long-term goals? Imagine already having it. Does it bring the real value to your life besides the very pleasure of attainment?**

Memento Mori - remember one day you die. Be. Here. Now.,"When you wake up today to face the uncertainty and turmoil of the world in order to accomplish the tasks and goals you've previously set out for yourself, please remind yourself - Memento Mori, death is inevitable.

In today's age of information and disinformation we are constantly bombarded with a stream of events that are outside of our control, but know that at the centre of those events are brave people who live each day knowing that it may be their last.  It's ok to feel emotional, it's ok to feel afraid, and it's ok to worry about the worst-case scenarios and plan for what you may do in such catastrophic events. 

Then remind yourself that whatever happens in the grand scheme of things is largely outside of your control; and that there is nothing you can actually do to change them and that there is no point in wishing that things may have turned out different, or that you did things differently in the past to change your circumstances today.

As you go through your day, take a pause in each moment and each situation and remind yourself why you're here; your actions and your reasons and your passions led you to this moment, to embark on whatever endeavor it is that you're currently pursuing; be it work, school, serving your country and community, taking care of loved ones, or simply taking time to yourself - whatever it is, you must ensure that you are *being* in this moment, and so are the people around you.  

So why allow this moment to pass without a smile?  Why allow this moment to pass without a friendly hello and conversation with your neighbours and acquaintances?  Why allow yourself to scold your loved ones, be they your children or parents or spouse?  That is not how you intended for this moment to be when you embarked on this journey, so why would you let these precious moments we have left slip away?

Please remember the inevitable; this is all temporary, and this too shall pass, even life.  Hug your loved ones, make their day as special as you can.  Be friendly and smile to your neighbours and acquaintances, and extract the best possible thing that you can from this very moment.  Do the thing that you've been putting off for so long that is nagging in the back of your head.  And if you can, take time to relax and do the things you enjoy - for self-care and reflection are just as important as purpose and self-improvement.

Don't let another moment go to waste.  Do not allow yourself to become perturbed by the negative thoughts and actions of others, instead understand that collectively we are experiencing trauma most of us never thought we would experience in our generation and not everyone can process it as well as you; the practitioner of stoicism and philosophy, or the practitioner of religion and the devout, or the practitioner of believing in humanity and something greater than yourself.  If you can talk to someone to help them be rational and level-headed during these unprecedented times, then please do so - but do not take to heart if you cannot change their minds.  Do not allow yourself to be perturbed.

To be," 

Such a bless it is,

to be,

to love, to fight, to cry, to see,

thus said the wise: “Memento Mori”,

“Remember you will die”,

and many got scared,

“You are crazy”, they said,

But not me, finally,

I was freed.

I was born to die,

I don’t know when,

someone already threw the die,

I don’t control the outcome,

I just chose to try.",Stoicism,1613955823.0,t3_lpbd1h,0.98,865

Observations by a dying stoic - part 5,"I started posting about my situation on Reddit back in January 2021 when I was diagnosed with Stage IV Pancreatic Cancer.  Since then I’ve been focused on how my stoic practice/training is holding up under the challenges. Right now the cancer seems to be held in check and I feel better than I have for a year. I made some adjustments in eating and exercising that should have been done years ago, but at least they are in motion now.

After the initial shock of the diagnosis, my focus really has been on beating the cancer, not fretting about now many days I have left. When I told my best-friend he showed up at my door carrying encouragement, support and lots of helpful supplements. Took me to the surgery to get my port installed and generally has been supporting me as he could. I got a call on Sunday that he had passed away a couple of days before. I had just spoken to him 1 or 2 days before. He was not in the best of health, but looks like COVID took him out. 

So now the stoic shoe is on the other foot so to speak. Here he was doing what he could to save me and now he’s just gone. He was my best friend from the sixth grade (40 plus years!). He was worried about me but I ended up outliving him. Just another of those reminders that we are not guaranteed anything beyond the current moment. Provides a pretty stark reminder to enjoy your time now, or as in the words of the late great Warren Zevon, “Enjoy every sandwich.”

This will provide a little course correction, I think. I’ve tried to live my life as normally as before the diagnosis, and except for the days when the chemo really hit me I’ve done that. But there has been a certain self-centeredness to my mid-set, after all I’m the one dying here. But that really wasn’t true when to came to my friend and me. I’ll be spending the next few days pondering all of this. I think the shift in thinking will be good, more focus on leaving each interaction with others on a good note to avoid that whole “but the last time I saw them I yelled at them for something stupid, and now there’s no way to make it right.”

So some of the things swirling around my head now:

· More focus on others – what does this look like?

· Fix problems as soon as they arise – particularly people problems

· Less focus on things (once affairs are in order) that will belong to someone else before too long – let it go!

· In any case, I’ll essentially be forgotten within a few generations, make sure those closest to me are cared for as well as possible after my passing – it won’t matter to me once I’m gone, but will ease the transition, I think.",Stoicism,1634680028.0,t3_qbltym,0.99,858

A guy from a party tried to kill me and I thought it was a teachable moment.,"I'll try to make a long story short, I was doing a guy I barely know a favor, but when I told him I was giving his car keys to his parents because I didnt trust him with them, he snapped. He grabbed a fire extinguisher from his car and said ""I didnt want to have to do this, you made me""

He had already said he would ""slit my throat""  ""make sure you're going to die tonight""  multiple times prior, so when he grabbed a fire extinguisher I started to take him seriously.

Guy was being quite the jerk all night and there was a girl I just met and another drunken friend who was very scared looking on. 

I grappled him, he tried to bite off my ear and my chest through my jacket, he tried to gouge my eyes leaving scratches and bleeding on my face. I held him in a pin and told him ""I'm your friend and I'm going to do everything I can to keep you safe tonight""

Eventually he was arrested for a DUI after escaping his parents house where I had left him, but I felt I did everything I could to help.

Now my one friend stayed quiet but the girl was angry with me. She wanted me to hurt him, she didnt talk to me again after that and she was completely sober. I tried to explain that I didnt believe in fighting but it was an awkward ride home (she elected to drive me home so I could drive the guy home in his car, we are nice people).

Quick flex I'm 240 pounds, at one time the best highschool wrestler in the country, I do MMA and in the top 1% for fitness. 

I heard a quote today ""those who have weapons and keep them sheathed shall inherit the earth""

That really resonated with me. Maybe I'm wrong. Everyone has their own opinions.

*edit*

While the quick flex was definitely a brag, It is an important detail. If I was an average guy, I don't know who I'd be or how I'd react. But I've always been bigger and athletic. Psychologically speaking I might be a very different person if I grew up otherwise.

How to never be insulted again. A lesson from Marcus Aurelius,"Hi fellow Stoics!

After getting very warm feedback from many of you guys on my previous post on [coping with pain](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/mk1ii3/stoicism_for_pain_relief_how_i_helped_my_father/), I've decided to keep posting stoic practical exercises here more regularly.

This time we will talk about the role of judgment. As many of you might have heard, excellence comes not as a result of a single action but habits and constant work on improving yourself and correcting your own flaws.

Each of us has lots of things to work on in ourselves, but most of our flaws try to hide behind. The Stoic emperor Marcus Aurelius had not been an exception before he internalized the wisdom of stoicism. One cannot become a teacher without being a student. Students of Stoicism benefited from their tutors' wisdom by treating them both as models, whose behavior they were inspired to emulate, and mentors who could give them valuable advice.

But why do we need the tutor in the first place? Aesop put it beautifully in one of his fables. Each of us has two sacks, one with the flaws of others, and it hangs within our view. Another is behind our back, filled with our own faults. That's why we see others' flaws quite clearly, but can't really see our own.

So we need someone else around to spot those faults. And it's not necessary for someone to stand there all the time. Instead, it can be the image of someone who we deeply respect and admire.

So let's proceed with the exercise.

&#x200B;

>Hi! My name is Marcus Aurelius, an emperor from the Golden Age of Rome.  
>  
>During my time as Roman Emperor, I fought many wars for our empire's glory and peace and faced many hardships. But I found that people's inner peace doesn't depend on neither external stability nor fortunate events.  
>  
>For us Stoics, the key to inner peace lies in our judgment. The wrong judgment will lead to disturbance and suffering even in the most fortunate circumstances. While right one will preserve our inner calmness against all of life's hardships.  
>  
>Stoics believe that our mind's balanced state is disturbed by intense emotions, especially by negative ones, such as anger, despair, fear, or envy.  
>  
>But also, an obsessive passion might disturb our inner peace.  
>  
>Our emotions are not caused by things or events themselves but by our judgment about them.  
>  
>Think of a perfectly straight stick. When you put it underwater, it will appear as bent or broken to the onlooker.  
>  
>While external things and events may not be under our control, we certainly control our judgment. Therefore, we have the key to our inner peace always at our disposal.  
>  
>Let me give you an example. Imagine you are insulted by two different people. Both are calling you ""a failure."" Now, if the first person appeared to be a mad man who randomly insulted you in the street, you most likely wouldn't care too much. Buf if a beloved one, like your father or your sister, would call you ""a failure,"" it would probably hurt you.  
>  
>But why is that? In both cases, the insult was the same. The reason lies in our value judgments and expectations. The person on the street doesn't know you, and you might not even care what he thinks of you. Also, the fact that he appears to be mentally ill makes his behavior expectable.  
>  
>On the other hand, we usually want our beloved ones to have a positive picture of us. We expect them not to insult and hurt us. Even though it's ultimately not under our control.  
>  
>**When was the last time you were insulted? How did it make you feel? Try to identify the underlying judgment and expectation towards the other person.**  
>  
>This exercise is supposed to emphasize the role that our judgments play in forming our emotions.  
>  
>So far, so good. But in which way should we change our judgments to preserve our inner calmness when we face adversity and hardship?  
>  
>We should change them in a way so that they reflect the level of control we have over a particular object, person, or event.  
>  
>Think of it like that - we don't control external things, such as the weather, illness, and other people's behavior.  
>  
>So the reason we get hurt by other peoples' insults is that we assume them to act according to our expectations about how they ought to behave towards us. And since we cannot ultimately control behaviors or opinions of others, such unrealistic expectations might provoke frustration and anger when those expectations are not met.  
>  
>I firmly believe that we should focus and care more about the things within our power, about our character and judgments, and less about external things.  
>  
>It just so happens that we as humans are naturally drawn to them.  
>  
>Let's leave it here for now. We will discuss internal and external things and how we should deal with them in the next lesson. I hope you will join me!  
>  
>And now, I would like to introduce you to an exercise that will help you to control your emotions through exercising your judgment.  
>  
>**The exercise is called ""Role model.""** **Imagine that an ideal Stoic person observes what you are doing. Whenever you are about to lose your inner peace, you should ask him or her how you could reframe your perspective, accounting for things within and without your control.**  
>  
>**This ideal person might be your favorite teacher, grandfather, priest, or favorite author. Just think of them as Stoics in this exercise.**  
>  
>Hope this exercise helps.  
>  
>Remember, if you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.  
>  
>See you in the next lesson!

Marcus's view on anger,"“Keep this thought handy when you feel a fit of rage coming on—it isn’t manly to be enraged. Rather, gentleness and civility are more human, and therefore manlier. A real man doesn’t give way to anger and discontent, and such a person has strength, courage, and endurance—unlike the angry and complaining. The nearer a man comes to a calm mind, the closer he is to strength.”

"Seneca was a billionaire statesman. Marcus Aurelius was the emperor of Rome. What does it mean to take instruction from men in these ultra-privileged positions with regard to our own, far less successful, lives?","This is an odd question and I'm still not sure quite what motivates it nor what I'm trying to clarify.

Briefly, I think I have a concern about whether a philosophy espoused by hyper-famous, ultra-successful individuals can truly get into the humdrum, prosaic stresses and concerns that confront those of us who are neither billionaires nor emperors.

It seems strange that people who can have had no idea what it feels like to struggle financially, to hold a menial, meaningless job, or to doubt their own efficacy and purpose in a world that seems rigged toward the better-off, yet have anything meaningful or lasting to teach to those who do.

Is there an issue here? Or does Stoicism trade in truths so necessary and eternal that they transcend social divisions? Looking forward to some clarity from this most excellent of subs.",Stoicism,1632870587.0,t3_pxidoh,0.93,842

Understanding Fear & Anxiety,"Fear, like most every other emotion, is motivated by our assumptions, values, expectations and insecurities. If you were to stand on the edge of a cliff, there would be an alarm going off in your head reminding you to remain present and attentive in every step you take, to be more careful than you normally would be. The scenario of you slipping and falling is played out within your mind, you imagine the consequences and you feel even more fear at this moment because you know that it is possible.

This is the fear of your mortality becoming real to you, and a cliff is not required for it. This can happen because of a car nearly missing you or any other near-death situation, you enter into an area where there is a danger; you see the danger; you predict the outcome of an incautious action in face of the danger, and you in some part feel the emotional consequences of that action. You’ve never fallen off of a cliff, but if you stood atop a cliff and looked down, visualizing yourself falling, you would feel a small part of what you would feel if you actually were falling.

Despite the fact you are standing on solid ground, you feel the fall. You feel the fear of a situation before the situation happens. This is anxiety, to feel not what you should feel; but to anticipate what could go wrong, and to feel the results immediately. 

If anxiety is feeling something before it has occurred, and thus suffering the emotional consequences of actions which have never been taken, then the problem cannot be the situation, but rather our attitude and expectations regarding the problem.

An anxiety ridden young man might want to ask someone out on a date and reconsider because he has already decided he knows how the other person will answer, but how can he know? How can he be sure? His premeditation of what may happen keeps him from experiencing life and making decisions, If he continues in this way, he will live a life of complete and total indecision, and never be satisfied with any option given to him, for he will always see that something could go wrong.

This is the work of expectation, which anxiety needs in order to function, by eliminating expectation, anxiety ceases to make sense, and begins to crumble.

So how do we eliminate expectation? By examining it, and deciding whether our expectations are reasonable or, frankly, insane. Let us consider an example, you are walking down the street and trip, and as you stand up, you see a group of people laughing at you. Would this surprise you? Would this subvert your expectations about humanity? Why, exactly, have you not yet noticed that men can and will be spiteful and arrogant? Ignorant of their own flaws and yet critical of others. Would you also expect to not be shot at while at war? Yes, there are those that would help you up after you fall, yes there are those who would show you mercy in war, but you have lived in this world long enough to see both goodness and evil manifest itself, do you believe yourself immune to the effects of one and not the other? Take these words of Marcus Aurelius to heart,

>“When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they can't tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are unnatural.”

Your life will be impeded, you shall meet those who hold disdain for you for no reason, you will be beaten; physically or mentally, and at the end of it all, the earth will swallow you and you will be forgotten. The cliff is real, and you are destined to fall, again, and again, and again.

Expecting not to fall is irrational, as irrational as not expecting to die, or expecting never to be insulted. It is inevitable.

And that’s ok, it’s fine, there’s nothing wrong with falling, because as stated earlier.

>“Anxiety is feeling something before it has occured, and thus suffering the emotional consequences of actions which have never been taken, then the problem cannot be the situation, but rather our attitude and expectations regarding the problem.”

Just like the young man who fears approaching someone he feels affection for, we treat every problem life presents us with as something that will harm us, or reduce our stature, or inconvenience us. We refuse to look at life’s difficulties proportionately, and once we do, once we stare at it and inspect it, we begin to see that the fall isn’t as far as we thought, and that we could even manage to start climbing down if only we are careful and attentive. Once we realign our expectations, and view the world more proportionately, we see that maybe the fall isn’t so bad, maybe the consequences won’t be what we thought they would be, maybe even if they are, that isn’t so bad.

And this is why you must work to destroy your expectations, these insidious things which confine you and propagate more anxiety in your mind. Expect only what is observably true, and value only that which is under your control. For if you expect that you will keep all of your wealth, and a recession hits, you will be miserable. If you expect to become a runner, and your legs begin to rot, you will be miserable, but if you expect only one thing; that you will bear life’s difficulties as a good and virtuous man, then you shall forever be unperturbed. For no amount of wealth given or taken shall affect your virtue, your personhood, your ability to choose who you wish to be. Choice is, as Viktor Frankl said, the one thing that remains despite all circumstance,

>“We who lived in the concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms — to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.”

So your expectation must not revolve around circumstance or other’s actions, only your own. You shall free yourself of anxiety if only you do this, expect yourself to remain an upstanding and moral person regardless of what befalls you. If fate decides that you shall be a beggar, then be a good and kind beggar, give what you can when you can. If fate decides that you should lose an arm, bear the loss with the knowledge that your arm was not yours in the first place, it was given to you by nature and now it has returned to nature. You are not belongings, you are not your body, you are not what happens to you, you do not decide what fate shall do to you; you only decide how you respond to it. Fate will do what it wishes to you, you have no choice in this matter, but decide now whether you should fear the inevitable or accept it.

And as long as you place your value in this alone, what is there to fear? What event can bring anxiety to you if the only important thing, how you bear the event, is within your control?

Only the fear of failure remains, one source of anxiety, instead of the thousands you had previously, the fear that maybe you won’t do as you should, that you aren’t strong enough to be virtuous. 

The difference between this anxiety and the others is clear, it isn’t an anxiety which focuses on how events will unfold, but how you will respond to the events. 

This anxiety, while preferable to the other ones, is still not a productive one, for to live in fear that you will be unvirtuous suggests that you do not believe in your ability to be virtuous, and this shows that you do not believe in yourself.

Not only will this anxiety punish you when you fail to be virtuous, which we all do, it shall simply resurface later even if you are perfectly virtuous, questioning whether you’ll be able to be so virtuous next time. 

You must accept yourself, not as you wish to be, just as you are. You are unvirtuous, and you have failed, and you will be unvirtuous, and you will fail, but expecting yourself to not fail is again the source of your misery. You must accept yourself and come to terms with the fact that self improvement, becoming a better person, is not an easy path and you shan’t walk it easily. You must be satisfied with your efforts towards the goal, not the goal itself. The sage is an unattainable ideal, and that’s ok, because it is our efforts which count. It is the fact that we, heads bloody, arms tired, refuse to stop trying to be better, and love ourselves not for our perfection; but for our pursuit of it. I will reference a previous writing of mine, which focuses on the purity of effort. Consider these words, from Albert Camus,

>“I leave Sisyphus at the foot of the mountain. One always finds one's burden again. But Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is well. This universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night-filled mountain, in itself, forms a world. The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.”


Camus' philosophy operates in opposition to classical Stoicism, but what one extrapolates from the above quote is up to them. To Camus', the world being stripped of inherent meaning allowed him to place meaning where he wished. What I find quite Stoic about the above quote is Sisyphus' perceived attitude. The rock will always go up, and it will always go down, this is not within Sisyphus' control. However, the struggle towards the heights, the intention to move, the choice to act, this is what fulfills Sisyphus. Sisyphus refuses to place his value in the results of his actions, and instead embodies the Stoic ideal of acting dutifully, struggling towards a greater ideal, without expectation or worry for the result of those actions. The intention to be good is enough for Sisyphus, he cares not for success or failure, only that he continues in what he set out to do. And as Stoics that should be enough for us shouldn't it? I cannot control the ways of the world or how people react to my actions, I cannot even ensure that my actions have a true impact on the world, think of how many writings of the Stoics we have lost. Think of how they will be lost in time. Yet that wasn't important to the Stoics, they knew their efforts could be prevented by the world, they knew that anyone they helped would fall away into dust one day, but it wasn't about the results of their work; it was the intention behind it. Like Sisyphus' efforts, all the Stoics' efforts will one day be forgotten, we are lucky to have their writings now, but it's simply a matter of time before they are gone. But the Stoics, like Sisyphus, didn't concern themselves with what the results of their actions would be, they awoke with the intention to be good, and this was enough.

Today my boss yelled at me and it was...beautiful.,"I sort of felt like a sociopath, definitely like a stoic in the colloquial sense (emotionless, etc). Today my boss called my colleagues and I into a room, and he's your typical hothead manager. Since we get paid a pretty good salary, it isn't one of those situations where you can just walk out on the job and find another  the same day.   
     
That being said, I couldn't help but think of stoicism when the tirade began. First I thought of it as being voluntary discomfort, then I thought of Marcus Aurelius' *""the people I deal with today will be...""* quote. Then it began to feel surreal, as if I floated above the room and thought *""we'll all be dead in a 100 years and this specific moment in history will be as important as a bag blowing through the wind.""* There were even times I drifted off, imagining my boss as an actor in a movie where his role was to scream, and I was simply observing without being *personally* affected.  
    
 Even when my boss called on me, I sort of just, calmly explained the situation, what we'll do about the work issue, etc. It almost felt like a superpower.  The context of what was said is not important, it was just the feeling. I don't know if this sort of detachment is healthy but I thought I'd mention how stoicism has effected me in this specific circumstance.

Feeling guilty when I spend time on anything except strictly productive things.,"Stoicism seems to have made me into a workaholic, I feel guilty when I do unproductive things like playing games, watching movies and videos, using social media. 

At one hand, it makes sense. Why waste time doing unproductive things, when you could be studying, working, learning etc. On the other hand, working 24/7 for the rest of your life doesn't seem very appealing.

I tried to find the right balance, and it only feels right when I'm working all day long or else at the end of the day, when I go to sleep, I would feel I could have been more productive. Any advice is appreciated.

Read all the comments. From tomorrow, I'll be doing different activities (running, meditating, light exercise, reading, etc) to take a break, instead of addictive activities (games, social media, videos). Also will be setting an alarm, so that I know when to stop and get back to work.

"If you smile when you are alone, then you really mean it.","The more I grow up the more I realize that, to be happy, one needs to be able to live with himself. To be lonely.

I'm 23 years old, male, and in the last years I realized that people don't really care about what your dreams are, what are your ambitions, who you truly are. Most of them just want to see the results of your hard work, they don't care what you've done to accomplish your goals. They want the final product.

I think this is why most people suffer when they are alone, when they feel like they have no friends: it is because no one comprehends their thoughts. I believe that we, as humans, strive to be understood by others. We want to feel the relief of knowing that other people comprehend our feelings, our future projects. That other people are proud of what we are doing.

The reality of it all is, however, that only us, only within ourselves we know what we really are up to. No one can be proud of us more than ourselves, no one can love us more than ourselves. Other people come and go, friends of a lifetime are ready to turn their back on you anytime, if it is in their interests. The only true friend we have, is ourselves.

All of this doesn't mean that we should actively avoid people, I'm actually very extroverted: I love make people laugh and experience all the good sensations that come in staying in a group. But that's all there is to social life, the good feelings. In the end, after all the smiles, the kisses and the laughs, only the person you watch in the mirror every morning knows what's up with your life. Your true life.

Aristotle said: *Whosoever is delighted in solitude, is either a wild beast or a god.*

I then say to be your personal god, and to love yourself and your loneliness. Because that's all you really possess in this world.

I went ahead and counted all the posts that were simply asking for help on things sorting by new right now.

How to make good decisions and don't waste your time on crap. Lesson from a former slave.,"Hi fellows! I'd like to share with you a lesson from a stoic philosopher Epictetus that helped me to become way more productive and make better decisions. I've framed it from his perspective, so he is a teacher here. Wish you a good read!

# Dichotomy of Control Exercise

Hi, I am **Epictetus**. I was born a slave in the Roman Empire and was crippled later on in life. This was terrible fortune and not of my own doing.

But neither the shackles of my enslavement nor the limitations of my body made me feel limited. This might seem very strange to you, but let me explain.

Some things are within our complete control, while others are not. Within our control are judgment, desire, aversion, and whatever is of our own doing.

Not within our complete control are our body, our property, reputation, and whatever is not of our own doing.

That's because there are many external factors involved: illness, misinformation, and the impact of other people on us.

However, judgments and desires are internal to us, as we learned in the previous lessons.

But how should we deal with things like our health or our reputation? We can't really stop caring about them, but we can't guarantee that these things will turn out the way we want either.

We Stoics believe that we can't really fail in those things, as long as we are doing everything possible within our control. If they still go wrong, like due to you having an unexpected disease, it was not of your doing, so it's not a failure.

**Now, think of the last time you were afraid of failing, for example, public speech. How did you feel? How did it play out? Did you feel that you have complete control over the situation?**

We control far less than we might intially think, and we likely have mistaken ideas about what we control.

The problem is that by pursuing things that are not under control, we can't really control our happiness.

Let me give you an example.

It is like planning a sea voyage. What can you do? You can choose the captain, the sailors, the day, the right moment. Then a storm comes upon us. At this point, what are your concerns? Your part is done.

So choosing the captain was under your control, and weather conditions were not. So why would you even be bothered by the failure if it was not under your complete control?

What can you do in situations like that? Shift your goals from the external to the internal: repeat yourself that your objective is not to have a safe voyage but to do the best that is within your power to make it safe.

If you redirect your attention and desires in this fashion, you can't get disappointed that easily.

So let's do a quick exercise.

**Think of an important event you have soon. It might be a date or a public performance. What is under your control within this event? What is not?**

**Great. How can you focus more on things you control and pay less attention to something you can't?**

We should focus our energy and resources on affecting what we can control and turn away as much as possible from what we can't.

This boils down to the notion that we are in charge only and exclusively of our deliberate judgments, our endorsed opinions and values, and our decisions to act or not to act.

Nothing else.

I highly recommend doing this exercise daily, looking at specific events in your life. As you continue practicing, you'll internalize what is really under your complete control and what isn't.

\-------

P.S. If you liked this exercise, I have written more lessons like that. Just in case you **are curious to explore more**, let me know and I will share the link to **other lessons** in DM.

The themes I cover are: getting disciplined, reducing anxiety, learning about your life values, decision-making, the art of happiness, and being present in the moment.

The lessons are based on the primary sources of wisdom from more than 2500 years of history of philosophy: Plato, Aristotle, Lao Tzu, Carl Jung, Stoics, and many others.",Stoicism,1618402559.0,t3_mqpb19,0.99,818
Regrets are the biggest fallacy,"Regret is probably the biggest struggle I have had to face. 

All of us probably have regrets, things we wish we had done differently. Maybe we even obsess over it. But at the end of the day always remember that regrets are the biggest fallacy.

Obviously if you knew what you know now, than you would’ve made a different decision. Obviously if you knew at the time that you would hate your job, you wouldn’t have applied for it. Of if you knew at the time that you would get a ticket for speeding, you wouldn’t have sped.

But that’s the whole point, you never could’ve known. So rest assure that as much as you hate the decision you made, it was a decision that you chose to make which seemed right at the time.

"Marcus Aurelius Meditations (5.26) - Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional",">Make sure that the ruling and sovereign part of your soul remains unaffected by every movement, smooth or violent, in your flesh, and that it **does not combine with them**, but circumscribes itself, and restricts these experiences to the bodily parts. Whenever they communicate themselves to the mind by virtue of that other sympathy, as is bound to occur in a unified organism, you should **not attempt to resist the sensation**, which is a natural one, but you must **not allow the ruling centre to add its own further judgement** that the experience is good or bad. 

1. Something happens.  
2. You are struck by it, feeling a natural physical sensation (be it trembling, crying, nausea, tension, etc.).  
3. You recognize what happened and fully accept the physical sensations that arose, letting them come, stay the amount of time that they need to stay and leave on their own. This may take some time.  
4. Learn from the experience and move on.

"Today I got stuck in snow, dug my way out, and realized how far I’ve come since my battle with depression","I live in a place where it doesn’t snow often, but I’m close enough to the mountains to drive there whenever I want to hike and explore. I’m a big nature guy so I like to find solitude in the woods. 

What I wasn’t expecting when going into the mountains was the snow in parking lots/driveways/shoulders or anything that isn’t a paved road. As soon as I pulled into the park, I got stuck in snow, unable to go back or forward (I drive a small car with no snow tires). 

Realizing the predicament I got myself into, I immediately turned to stoicism. What’s in my control? Not a whole lot; the car is stuck on ice with snow blocking the wheels and bumpers, so I would either have to call a tow truck or have someone help push the car. What’s not in my control? Much more; no service, I’m alone, people aren’t stopping to help, no access to emergency services. Seeing my only option, I started digging.

At some point, I got tired, so I sat down and opened up Meditations. The first thing that caught my eye was this quote:

“That which is an obstacle in the road helps us on the road.” - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations 5

In the past, depression would have taken over, leaving me upset and frustrated and unmotivated. Stoicism has since helped me to change my mindset (along with therapy and other treatment). Why waste my energy being upset when I could use it to help my predicament? Why rely on some phony idea of help coming out of nowhere when I’m the only one who can help myself? Having a stronger mindset with better priorities for myself has definitely gotten me a long way. 

I’m still fairly new to this practice; I was turned onto the idea of stoicism and philosophy about a year ago and have slowly been arriving to new ways of thought. While this situation was quite literally an obstacle in the road, I have already found it helpful. Like I said, the changes in my thoughts and discipline have been tremendous thanks to stoicism. Any thoughts or advice for a fellow student is always appreciated.",Stoicism,1614467413.0,t3_ltzphp,0.99,807
We suffer more often in imagination than in reality.," 

""What I advise you to  do is, not to be unhappy before the crisis comes; we suffer more often in imagination than in reality. Some things torment us more than they ought; some torment us before they ought; and some torment us when they  ought not to torment us at all. We are in the habit of exaggerating, or  imagining, or anticipating, sorrow. It is likely that some troubles will  befall us; but it is not a present fact. How often has the unexpected  happened! How often has the expected never come to pass! And even though  it is ordained to be, what does it avail to run out to meet your suffering?""

I had a stoic success moment yesterday,"Yesterday while I was leaving the gym I backed up into another car in the parking lot. The parking is on a slope so I didn’t see it and left a dent on it. 

I was the only one in the parking lot at the time and nobody saw it happen and for a moment admittedly I considered just driving off, but I knew that the right thing to do was find the person and give them my information. 

I go into the gym to leave a note for the person since I didn’t want to cause a scene and when I went back to the parking lot the driver was entering her car and didn’t even notice the damage. 

I waived her down and told her what happened and exchanged insurance information. 

I know my rates will go up but it wouldn’t be fair for her to pay for my mistake.

Why do we never seek inner validation and motivation : For example, when in front of an task like cleaning your room, instead of focusing on the “I don’t really care, I don’t feel like cleaning it” why don’t we try to “ Man I really deserve to work in a clean and organized environment.”.

Laid off from job yesterday,"I was laid off yesterday from my job of 7 years, completely out of the blue with no cause or explanation other than ""restructuring"". I tried to act as a model employee, even just received a shout out in a memo last week where I, direct quote: ""have set a great example of what we can all strive to achieve."" Fast forward one week and I find myself in my boss's office with my walking papers without so much as a reasonable explanation. 

If I were not a stoic, this would have greatly bothered me. I simply shrugged and said ""oh well"", and went on my way. In the past before discovering stoicism, I have gotten depression from something like this happening. It would have set me back months, trying to figure out what I did wrong, 'why me?', and devalued myself as a human being and my abilities, when in all reality this likely had nothing to do with my abilities and likely more to do with cost-cutting measures and me having a higher salary than most other employees there. 

This is a great example for me of how everything can change in an instant. I worked through the entire pandemic and thought that if my job was secure through all of it, there would be no way it wouldn't be safe now that things are picking back up and getting somewhat back to ""normal"". But life doesn't care about that. There are always factors outside of our control, and we can strive to do the very best in everything and literally have one factor that causes everything to collapse. Everything that mattered there suddenly doesn't matter anymore. All of the work I still had left to do, the colleagues I worked with and everything that I had planned are suddenly wiped out in an instant. And I love it. For the first time in my life, I am excited for losing my job. Stoicism has let me view this only as an opportunity for growth and a pathway to freedom.

I am going to relish the free time that I have now. I am going to use this time to further myself as a person and my skills as an employee. One practical way is to look up higher up postings for jobs I wish to aspire to, find common requirements and skills that I do not possess, and utilize my free time to teach myself these skill online to become a more well-rounded, knowledgeable and experienced candidate. The world is my oyster, so to speak, and I realize now how much I was holding myself back by working there long past the point where I stopped learning. 

Anyway, I just wanted to share this post because I know there are many people on this subreddit asking advice regarding job loss, and while it is easy to give advice from an outside perspective, I wanted to give a real life example of this that just occurred yesterday.",Stoicism,1626198888.0,t3_ojkzfx,0.99,790

I was NOT stoic yesterday and I think it was the right choice,"In my journey through Stoicism, I try to step back often and look at things from an outside perspective. Yesterday I failed to do this and acted emotionally.

Without giving too much details, I work in IT and one of the most pleasurable things about my job is the amount of people I meet in different walks of life. I make it a point to work on the human relationship, as ultimately I believe it is the most important aspect in a work environment.

Long story short, we had a meeting with management and they wanted to take the human element out of equation ( or reduce it) .
I tried to act calm but I couldn’t. I called my manager out, argued that this was a bad idea, and drove home the point that our greatest advantage over competition is that we harness this human relationship with the client. I spoke with anger in my voice and sadly I couldn’t remain cool as I wanted. 

This however seemed to effect the management and even my colleagues, one of them ended up private messaging me and congratulated me on the words I used as in his words “ I said it better than he ever could”.

I admit, I would have loved to be the stoic dude, the one with the cool voice and the calm attitude, but I failed. I was angry and throbbing with adrenaline. Honestly I was a bit disappointed with myself ( in terms of Stoicism). I however acknowledge that when dealing with irrational beings, emotion can be a good medium as well. I think that Stoicism does not tell us to be robots and ignore our emotions, but to embrace our humanity. I think this experience was still a good lesson in the walk that is Stoicism.

‘Men are disturbed not by things but by the view that they take on them’ -Epictetus,"Others opinions about you are more of a reflection on them and their subconscious then you as a person, equally how you view others says more about who you are then who they are. It’s foolish to think you may know someone better then they know themselves, the truth is that no one can truly know themselves or others as the human mind is too complex. The complexity of the human mind (think psychoanalysis) means that no human can be good or evil as these labels are too blanket making hate is futile. To insult others when angry is not to insult them but to insult the person you believe they are. Your beliefs about others are not inherently a reflection of who they are but a reflection of the beliefs and ideals you attach to them.   This realisation is not pretty but kind of grotesque. Could it mean humans are incapable of pity? Take feeling sympathy for another persons circumstance, is that just you relating your own insecurities of being able to see yourself in similar situation? After all you will never be them and will never be able to feel their pain, your feeling of sympathy possibly speaks more to your own insecurities then to their situation. Ask yourself this, if you could never be in there situation, not even hypothetically would you still feel pity? Can anyone help me out with this, I feel like unsure if I’m upstanding this right. :)

Why is suicide bad?,"First of all let me make it clear that this question is just out of my curiosity and philosophy, I'm not depressed or anything. 

Now whenever people talk about suicide they tend to sugarcoat things(and for good reasons) but I always wonder, as far as human knowledge goes life doesn't have a purpose. No matter how much fun you have or how poor you are at the end everything vanishes. So why can't a person(who let's say is suffering and would have to work a lot to get out of misery) just end his life because either way he WILL die someday. 

People say that your family and loved ones will suffer but let's be honest does it really matter when you are dead? 

So I know this is a very sensitive topic but I would appreciate if you can give your opinion on this. 

I have a very controversial opinion on this I think committing suicide or not is just a matter of opinion, if a person wants to live it's good if he/she wants to die... well... I'll not take it too far.",Stoicism,1588762736.0,t3_gehvce,0.95,781

East of Eden is amazingly stoic,"This book is a masterpiece to me. I tear up thinking about it. I consider it one of the more modern narratives on Stoicism with a touch of everything else too: Nihilism, Absurdism, Existentialism etc. Steinbeck is one of my favorite authors. At one point in the book one of the characters fondly flips through Meditations.

Some quotes:

“You're going to pass something down no matter what you do or if you do nothing. Even if you let yourself go fallow, the weeds will grow and the brambles. Something will grow.”

“We have only one story. All novels, all poetry, are built on the neverending contest in ourselves of good and evil. And it occurs to me that evil must constantly respawn, while good, while virtue, is immortal. Vice has always a new fresh young face, while virtue is venerable as nothing else in the world is.”

“I believe that there is one story in the world, and only one, that has frightened and inspired us, so that we live in a Pearl White serial of continuing thought and wonder. Humans are caught - in their lives, in their thoughts, in their hungers and ambitions, in their avarice and cruelty, and in their kindness and generosity too - in a net of good and evil. I think this is the only story we have and that it occurs on all levels of feeling and intelligence. Virtue and vice were warp and woof of our first consciousness, and they will be the fabric of our last, and this despite any changes we may impose on field and river and mountain, on economy and manners. There is no other story. A man, after he has brushed off the dust and chips of life, will have left only the hard, clean questions: Was it good or was it evil? Have I done well - or ill?”

“The Hebrew word, the word timshel - 'Thou mayest' - that gives a choice. It might be the most important word in the world. That says the way is open...Why, that makes a man great...He can choose his course and fight it through and win...I have a new love for that glittering instrument, the human soul. It is a lovely and unique thing in the universe. It is always attacked and never destroyed - because 'Thou mayest'.”",Stoicism,1593966740.0,t3_hlph1r,0.98,780

"About a week ago, the post ""Youtube's algorithm brings me this blessing gift"" featured advice on allowing others to not like you. I loved it so much that I transcribed the video so that I could place a copy on my wall. Here is that transcription if you'd like to do the same.","Not everyone is going to like you. Not everyone is going to accept you, or appreciate you. In fact, there will be many who dislike you, who will judge you, criticise you, and that's just the way it is. You can't please everyone.

Now certainly, we should be considerate of others. We should be respectful, and we should be watchful of our own behaviour, and if someone criticises us, it may be worth reflecting upon it to see if perhaps there is something we may need to address in our behaviour. But even if you're the kindest, gentlest, sweetest, most respectful person on the planet, there's simply going to be those who will find all kinds of reasons not to like you, and you just have to accept that. 

What I've found to be a really powerful piece of advice is to simply allow others the freedom not to like you, to allow them the freedom to disagree with you, to judge you, to think less of you. After all, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, even if that opinion is entirely baseless. But by allowing them to dislike you, what you're actually doing is recognising that they don't need your permission, they're going to do it whether you permit them to or not. But what you're actually doing is letting go of the need to control what others think, because you can't control that. If someone doesn't approve of you, the way you are, you can perhaps try to change some aspect of yourself in order to win their approval, but chances are they'll just find something else to criticise, because that's just what they do, they just like to critisise. So no matter what you do, they're likely going to find something to criticise, so forget about it. And even if you can win their approval, there's just going to be someone else who doesn't approve, and you'll never please everyone. 

So just allow others to have their opinions. You don't have to agree with them, you don't have to accept what they say, all you're doing is recognising that they have the right to think whatever they want to think. All you're doing is respecting that freedom, and it's such a liberating thing when you begin to do this, when you give up needing to have other people's approval, or needing to control what others think of you. You find your own freedom in that. And what you also find is that most people who don't like you are really struggling to like themselves. They may be deeply miserable; bitter. But as soon as you let go of the need for them to like you, you find a certain level of peace in that, and they can say whatever they want, and it only affects them, it doesn't have to affect you at all. You just go on with your life, doing what you do, and don't be bothered by it. 

What's important is whether or not you like you, whether or not you accept yourself, whether or not you appreciate yourself, and none of that should depend on what anyone else thinks. You have to see that for yourself. And when you do, you stop caring what other people think, and life is so much more pleasant that way. You become free to do so much more, to do what you feel passionate and inspired to do, to share your gifts, your creativity, your compassion. And anyone who doesn't appreciate that? That's their loss. You let them worry about that.

Marcus Aurelius on getting out of bed,"Recently I've had trouble finding the motivation to get out of bed, I looked to this quote by Marcus Aurelius

At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: “I have to go to work — as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for — the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?”

I've also looked at volunteer positions but they are all so far away from my town. Most of my daily time is therefore spent exercising, cleaning the house, or practising skills like guitar, the rest of my time is just leisure and I feel like I'm wasting it.

Stoics advise to go for long walks alone and it helps.,"Today i was feeling quite sad and lonely because i had a tough breakup a few weeks ago and i was planning to just sit at home and play games all day but i decided to follow the stoic advice and go for a long walk with my dog and enjoy nature, be social and to put my thoughts in check and i was surprised how effective it is.

I saw couples everywhere enjoying eachother and i was happy for them. I saw couples crying and arguing because valentines day didnt go how they hoped. I saw ex lovers crossing paths and shouting passive agressive things at eachother. I had small interactions with random people who wanted to pet my dog.

I got home feeling like my issues were nothing. Just a simple walk to make me see how everyone like Marcus says goes through the same cycles and pain and its just part of nature. Relationships form and then they end, you hurt for a while and then you go back to being yourself and the cycle continues.

Idk just thought i would share. If you are feeling down and u want to stay home, make an effort and go for a walk and experience the cacophony of life.",Stoicism,1644886514.0,t3_ssq3st,0.99,762

Life changing abstract by Viktor Frankl’s ‘Man’ search for meaning’,"‘What was really needed was a fundamental change in our attitude toward life. We had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that _it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us._ We needed to stop asking the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life- daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk or meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.’

I think this highlights both concepts of amor fati and the idea of the virtue of being good through action.

Fast forward today and I saw that one of my crushes in highschool is on linkedin writing one of those classic long essays about graduating gradschool and etc. Before I would compare but now a Stoic I realize this is all a plot for likes and to stir up envy.

'A tale of two monks' and a lesson about virtue ethics,"I happened upon this story today on [kottke](https://kottke.org/20/01/the-story-of-two-monks-and-a-woman):

>The tale of two monks and a woman is a well-known Buddhist parable. The story goes that two monks were traveling together, a senior and a junior. They came to a river with a strong current where a young woman was waiting, unable to cross alone. She asks the monks if they would help her across the river. Without a word and in spite of the sacred vow he’d taken not to touch women, the older monk picks her up, crosses, and sets her down on the other side.

>The younger monk joins them across the river and is aghast that the older monk has broken his vow but doesn’t say anything. An hour passes as they travel on. Then two hours. Then three. Finally, the now quite agitated younger monk can stand it no longer: “Why did you carry that women when we took a vow as monks not to touch women?”

>The older monk replies, “I set her down hours ago by the side of the river. Why are you still carrying her?”

The author's comment - ""the story is a reminder to not dwell on the past in a way that interferes with living in the present moment"" - is certainly correct, but I see a second meaning here as well.

The older monk physically touched the woman, but with proper intent. He understood the prohibition was not about touching per se, but about avoiding desire and attachment. It's not the act itself, it's  the reason and the intent that matter.

Ironically, the younger monk did become attached, and found himself clinging to an unimportant thing,  allowing it to unsettle him. The younger monk assented to _being touched_ by the encounter with the woman, in a way that the older monk avoided.",Stoicism,1580058002.0,t3_eu99oe,1.0,762

I really feel like I've found something that works for me. This is a great community.,"Stoicism makes me so comfy. Nothing has ever made me feel this way, truly. This community is amazing, and while there aren't many stoics in our personal lives that we can talk to, we have each other over the internet. Stoic quotes are so beautifully said. Everything just feels right, truly. I appreciate everyone here, because we're all making a contribution toward each other's journey in stoicism. Such a realistic, chill philosophy. Unrelated, but today I experienced something quite beautiful. I was watching a documentary series about how math/numbers influence this universe and how everything fits so remarkably well together. There was a scene where they were discussing constellations, stars etc. Something about looking at space makes me shift into this perspective that is so peaceful. I accept everything as it is, there's just this understanding and appreciation for life that, admittedly, I do not usually have. I should look at the stars more often.

"I'm Greek, raised and living in Greece. Never once has Stoicism been mentioned in school..","I'm Greek, born here, raised most of my life here, still live here (it's not as you think it's poverty and ghetto don't get excited). For a long enough time now ""it is what it is, life moves forward"" has been my main quote dealing with everything from inconveniences to even tragedy, yes we mourn but we cannot stop progressing in life sadly.

Anyway today I happened to stumble upon a video about ""Stoicism"" with the title ""Stoicism: The Art Of Not Caring"" I almost brushed it off as I already practice this most of the time but the setting and all seemed interesting so I said since I got nothing else to watch I'm gonna shoot it a shot might as well.

Surprised to find out it's basically my mentality and my way of thinking, not only this  but it originates from my country's ancestors. Now I'm really not a patriot, nor do I care about history, I believe in progress and history is the past, no need to know what cavemen and the romes did while our struggle has just begun, almost failed history.

But, I am 100% certain this has not **ONCE** been mentioned in a history book here, I think the why is obvious, they do not want people to be oblivious, they want us to be stressed so we work as we're told.

We all know we're taught what they want to teach us, censor or even overwrite history, but I felt like this had to be mentioned here.

*Proves they want us to care, they want us to be stressed, they want us to be controlled.*

&#x200B;

Edt: according to other Greeks here Soitcism has BEEN mentioned, but briefly, way to briefly and as we all know the way school teaches us we will not understand the information a deeper level, perhaps we'll even hate the information for being taught in school and being punished for not learning it resulting in students understanding it even less. Stoicism goes against most of society because they want people to be stressed, worrying and struggling.

Edit: for everyone asking what is ""they"" it's the obvious term used for higher powers such as society, education, the system, government and everything regarding that. Look at the context

Observations of a Dying Stoic - Part 7,"Long overdue for an update, I know. But then you stoics should really have no expectations. :)

Those that have been following know that I really only post as I think I have something to share that may be of interest or benefit to others. I am coming up on 2 years since I created this account and started posting in January of 2021. I don't really know how long ago my last post was and am not really that motivated to go back and check.

I am still fighting the cancer. I stopped chemotherapy Aug of 21 and was stable until this last June. At that time we discovered some tumor growth in the liver, although the pancreatic tumor and the bone cancer have remained stable. During the break I took from chemo I followed a pretty aggressive natural/off label approach to fighting the cancer and lived my life pretty much as normal.

The reason that we found new growth is that I developed a breathing problem starting in May of this year. One night I spent my time in bed gasping for air. This has been building up over time and I assumed maybe a side effect of my Covid19 from November of 21. I got up about 4am, told my wife I was driving to the ER and would see her in a couple of hours. Ha, talk about having no expectations. I thought I'd get a little Broncho dilatator and get sent home. No such luck. Was a P.F.O, which is basically a hole in your heart. I won't bore you with the details, Dr. Google can guide you if you are so inclined.  So 8 days in the hospital and all is well, mostly. What's significant about the event is that 1) we found new tumor growth in the liver, which didn't really phase me, and 2) a rerun of the situation when I was first diagnosed.

I was just cruising along in the hospital when the Surgeon came in to discuss the impending operation. First words out of his mouth is that ""*this is no walk in the park. There is a distinct possibility that we close the hole in your heart and your right side goes into cardia arrest. At that point there would be very little we could do to fix it, so dying during the operation is a real and not insignificant risk here*.""

Wow. Talk about deja vu all over again. After my initial diagnosis it took a few weeks but I really did come to terms and accept my fate, so to speak. Here we were again and I'm suddenly struck again by a potentially more impending death sentence and many of the same emotions. I realized that I had become somewhat complacent about the situation and had pushed my impending doom almost completely out of my mind. That was actually a great feeling upon some reflection. It assured me that I was focused on the living and not on the dying. I was somewhat surprised about my reaction to being told I might not survive the surgery, but the processing time from shock to acceptance this time was amazingly short, hours really. Something to ponder.

While we're on the topic of expectations, I think I previously mentioned my best friend from childhood passing away last October. The estate has been going through some court battles and is  now in probate. The pubic administrator for the county in which my friend lived was appointed as executor and was proceeding with the business of protecting the estate and getting estimates, determining who gets what based on the will, etc. One of the things bequeathed to me was the contents of his house. The house and property are going to a charity, but he wanted me to have his other possessions. The property is somewhat remote and sits on 12 or so acres.

So to protect the property the administrator boarded up the house, installed some cameras for remote monitoring and went about their business. What they failed to do was turn off the water to the residence. I don't really have to explain what happened next, do I? Didn't think so. Anyway, the leak went undetected for long enough in a boarded up house that virtually everything in the house that is not glass or stainless was completely destroyed by toxic mold. There were a lot of memories in there. Board games we played as children, books that we exchanged, pictures and gifts we had exchanged over the years - all gone.

I have handled it well, but my kids are now mourning all over again. They were expecting to be able to visit his place once again and claim some items of sentimental value, get some sort of closure. I am heading over in a couple of  weeks but I will have to wear a hazmat suit to enter. I will also have to negotiate with the public administrator regarding their total failure on their fiduciary duty. (If anyone knows a good probate lawyer in California, hit me up.)

So to close out, here are some things I am taking away from this latest period.

1. Recognize that death may be around the corner, but continue to engage with the living world as before, albeit with more grace and compassion.
2. Expectations are evil and only lead to pain and anguish if not managed correctly.
3. I did restart chemo over the last six weeks and have now realized that I am done with it. I will not live out my last days as a walking zombie. I want to stay engaged with my family, chase my granddaughters around the back yard, play catch, etc. and not just have them remember me as the old guy that was always in bed or too exhausted to engage. I'll continue the battle, but with options that do not kill me faster than the disease. However it turns out I am happy for the outcome and the chance to reassess how I was living before it was too late.

Philosophy is not a pill,"This post is directed at folks who are relatively new to Stoicism, or to philosophies of life in the abstract, and have a habit of asking for one-off solutions to ephemeral problems. I have noticed a few posts here that seem to betray a fundamental misunderstanding of the utility of Stoicism as a framework for living, which I would like to address. I apologize in advance for my excessive reliance on metaphors and analogies as rhetorical devices. I just really, really like them.

**Philosophy, especially Stoicism, is not a pill.** It is not medicine that you take when you are feeling ill. It is neither your lawyer, nor your tax specialist, nor your travel agent. It is not a taxi that you hail on a whim to carry you a few blocks down the road. It is not a tool that you pull off the shelf when you need to fix something, nor is it an umbrella that sits in your closet until the rainy season.

The recurrent fallacy we see so often is that some poor soul, anguished by their shortcomings or circumstances, believes they can be cured if only they receive the right quote or technique for dealing with it. While I truly wish to assist such individuals, I can't help but feel they are missing the point. Even those that are actively practicing Stoic principles, when confronted with mental anguish or adversity, can be so quick to assume that they must be missing something; something simple, actionable, and **easy.**

Consider the story of the renowned wrestler of antiquity, Milo of Croton. Milo was fabled to have possessed the strength to carry a fully grown ox on his shoulders. It is said that he achieved this by starting when that ox was but a newborn calf, no larger than a child. Day after day, year after year, Milo continued to hoist the calf upon his shoulders until it slowly grew into a hulking behemoth, and his strength with it. He did not simply resolve one day to learn how to lift a fully grown ox. He obtained this ability through daily practice, gradually conditioning him to achieve such a feat.

Please know that I bear you no ill will, and do not wish to belittle or alienate you. I do not wish to discourage you from seeking guidance, I merely wish to help you seek better guidance. There is no shortage of people who will gladly entertain a simple request for an inspirational quote or axiom. Indeed, this can even be quite productive at times! But far too often, it is just salve to soothe the wound, and will not beget meaningful change in your life.

What *does* beget meaningful change? In a couple words: Commitment and repetition. First, you must commit yourself to the pursuit of [virtue](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/wiki/faq#wiki_what_did_the_stoics_mean_by_.22virtue.3F.22). Then, you must repeatedly implement the [practices](https://donaldrobertson.name/2013/02/20/introduction-to-stoicism-the-three-disciplines/) of the philosophy. These actions will serve to prepare you for a lifetime of adversity, rather than to pacify some temporary suffering.

Through study you will learn that the practice of Stoicism is really quite simple, much like Milo's early task of lifting the ox in its infancy. In fact, the practice is less about what you do, and more about what you *refrain* from doing. Nonetheless, it is a futile exercise if you only partake once in awhile. Don't just sip from the river, swim in it. It is the only way to achieve lasting tranquility.

**Understand this:** Stoicism is not a pill, it is a practice. It is a seed that you plant, water, and nurture, until it grows into a bountiful vine from which you harvest a good life. And best of all, with the proper care, it can grow in the most infertile soil, under the harshest conditions.",Stoicism,1597891309.0,t3_id24wi,0.97,754

How long are you going to wait before you demand the best for yourself? - Epictitus,"Saw this quote today from stoicreflections. Had to get the full passage to reflect on this.

“How long are you going to wait before you demand the best for yourself and in no instance bypass the discriminations of reason? You have been given the principles that you ought to endorse, and you have endorsed them. What kind of teacher, then, are you still waiting for in order to refer your self-improvement to him? You are no longer a boy, but a full-grown man. If you are careless and lazy now and keep putting things off and always deferring the day after which you will attend to yourself, you will not notice that you are making no progress, but you will live and die as someone quite ordinary.
From now on, then, resolve to live as a grown-up who is making progress, and make whatever you think best a law that you never set aside. And whenever you encounter anything that is difficult or pleasurable, or highly or lowly regarded, remember that the contest is now: you are at the Olympic Games, you cannot wait any longer, and that your progress is wrecked or preserved by a single day and a single event. That is how Socrates fulfilled himself by attending to nothing except reason in everything he encountered. And you, although you are not yet a Socrates, should live as someone who at least wants to be a Socrates.” 

It’s exactly what I needed to hear to remind myself that the contest is NOW. Honestly, it made me anxious at first like ugh I do have to take action now LOL (I’m a 6 in enneagram and you can’t just tell a 6 to jump). I’m not comfortable taking risks and I’ll “jump” when I know for sure it’s safe when it comes to making big life decisions (with people, it’s easy I’m confrontational and a counter-phobic 6). I usually doubt myself, my skills, and the progress I’ve made thinking I need to do more, learn more, plan more, and to talk to more people before taking any action. Simply because I’m afraid to make a mistake. This quote reminded me that it’s fine and nothing will improve if I don’t just go for it. Practice works but it needs to get tested to see if it does work.

Why we should all learn to refrain from obsessing over what people might think of us - a thought I had today.,"I was outside mowing my yard today and as a result of my allergies being bad this time of year, had to wear a quite silly looking mask to be able to breathe properly. Having neurotic tendencies, I started creating self inflicted feelings of being judged or seen as stupid whenever someone would walk past me, or a car would drive by. Having recently stumbled into Stoic Philosophy, I caught myself doing so, and started analyzing just how silly and illogical I was being. The main question I was asking myself to put it simply: is the judgement I am inflicting upon myself actually happening, and if it is, why should I care? That lead to the thought below.

**Do not obsess over what you believe others could be thinking of you, as you would not concern yourself with the attention of a bird. A bird has no thoughts; thus it is illogical to get emotionally attached to the concept of the bird’s judgement or opinion of you. Yet, you do not know with absolute certainty that the person judging you has thoughts either. And if they do have thoughts, why assume they would spend time thinking of you, or that it matters? Do not concern yourself with such uncertainties, for you will then allow your paranoia to become a Tyrant over your life. You would not welcome with open arms an external Tyrant, so why tolerate a Tyrant of your own making?**

Bear with me if the bird analogy doesn't really make sense. As I was mowing, I came to realize that I didn't concern myself with the thoughts of the birds looking at me, so what really is the difference between a bird and a human? Obviously we are different; we can think, we can interact at a deeper level. But when it comes to judgement, why concern myself with either of them, for I control neither.

"Used to be anti-work, now I find fulfillment in doing my best.","(Edit added to the bottom)

Before I really started to read into Stoicism and other stoic-inspired literature, I was very cynical about work. This applied to School, my job, chores, etc.

But it was when I stumbled upon a quote from Marcus Aurelius that my perspective started to change.

“At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: “I have to go to work—as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for— the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?"" (**Marcus Arelius, Meditations, Book 2.1**)

Something about that quote really struck a nerve with me, and so I sat on it and it kept coming to mind whenever I was about to do any kind of work. I know the quote itself is about getting out of bed in the morning, but the specific line: ""What do I have to complain of, if I'm going to do what I was born for ... ""

To me now, I have accepted my work, of all kinds, as an opportunity to do my best. And that mindset has totally shifted my attitude, my relationships, my work ethic (obviously). It's almost been a catalyst for my personal change.

Another thing that's helped is the mantra: *Memento Mori, 'Remember you will die'* which Ryan Holiday mentions quite a bit. So I've coupled these two things together to give myself this reminder: **You can die at any time, so would you rather die knowing you did your best? Or would you rather die complaining about things you could not change?**

Maybe I'm just coping lol, but this reminder has been greatly impactful in my life. Thought I might share it with you all.

Edit: Did not expect this to blow up when I typed this up last night lol. I'm glad to see some discussion going on though, and want to address a counter-point to my post. Which is that working a corporate or retail job isn't want we are born to do. And while that may be true for some of you, I know a handful of former co-workers who absolutely love working their retail jobs. One of which has multiple degrees, and on the matter he simply says ""I'm a people person, it's what I do best."" So while it may not seem like it, some people just fit right in to their jobs. 

But for everyone else who work awful jobs? Well, I know not everyone has the opportunity to do so, but you can try to better yourself and work towards a better position, one more suited to your skills. For that is something that some of us *can* control! But I understand that is a complex discussion, and not everyone has equal opportunity. But something we can all do? Is our best. Whether you're working at McDonald's or as a programmer. Whether you're a student or a full-time parent. Our best is all we can give, so you might as well give it freely!",Stoicism,1627787216.0,t3_ovkjl7,0.96,750

By the time I got there, she was feeling much better; mom has some pulmonary issues (unrelated to Covid-19) that had been bothering her.

After a risk/benefit analysis, we all agreed that staying home was the best course of action for the time being.  I hung out for a few hours, watched the sunset from their porch, and stayed until both of them had showered and were safely in bed.  I'll do some shopping for them today.

“Stoics”,"I’m sick of seeing internet “entrepreneurs” and  “life coaches” tout around stoicism as some ancient secret method to get rich and be a super successful business guy. Stoicism has always emphasized humility and modesty. The main reason I got into Stoicism was because it teaches us to work hard and prioritize logic over emotion, while still maintaining the same views of ourselves no matter what our successes and failures are. 

Success doesn’t matter in Stoicism. Failure doesn’t matter either. What matters is remaining virtuous and logical through the struggles of life which will eventually lead to a deeper sense of fulfillment. But I still see these videos on YouTube titled something like “7 stoic tips that will CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!!!”, and when I click on it, I’m treated to a 12 minute video where some financial guru regurgitates basic Stoic concepts, and an ad plays every 2 minutes (not including the 4 times the guy making the video mentions his new book, or product, or sponsor).

I know I shouldn’t be upset about this, and I probably wouldn’t be if these people weren’t clearly trying to gain virality and sell products by teaching people about “Stoicism”. It gives new Stoics the wrong idea of what the philosophy is about and it exploits and, in my opinion, disgraces I the entire school of thought.

I’ve been getting back into Stoicism recently after spending time in quarantine and not really thinking much about it, so I went to Andrew Kirby’s channel, one of the first people who really got me into Stoicism. It seems to me like he’s started to go down the same path. That’s what inspired me to make this post.

Anyway I just wanted to know what other Stoics think about this. Do you guys agree, or am I completely wrong about this? I personally don’t think it’s right, or smart, to pursue economic success as a goal, so I may be projecting my own personal values onto stoicism, and if this is case let me know. Either way though, these entrepreneur types seem to make up a large demographic of modern Stoics, so I think it should be discussed.",Stoicism,1593902542.0,t3_hlc7os,0.98,748
"""Let life happen to you. Believe me: life is in the right, always.""","[Poet Rainer Maria Rilke](https://www.wikipedia.org/en/Rainer_Maria_Rilke#), [""Letters to a Young Poet](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46199.Letters_to_a_Young_Poet)"", letter 9.

Rilke's work often has a Stoic flavor, and this particular line from one of his letters to the young poet, Kappus, really expresses the idea of *Amor Fati* well. It was a fortunate coincidence that I discovered it when I did.

I, like a lot of others all over the world, have been going through some difficult times as of late, and was struggling with accepting my fate and not imposing judgements on it. I spent so much time, wishing for things to be as I wished them to and fantasizing about the way I wanted things to be happening. I finally came to grips with the futility of asking, ""why me?"", and realized a more pertinent question would be, ""why *not* me?"". We rarely, if ever, ask ""why me?"" when something that we judge to be good happens to us. Why? Because, of course we deserve it, we are special and unique and eminently worthy of whatever good fortune the universe sends our way. But, the truth is, there is nothing special about any of us that exempts us from fate. Fortune does not run hot and cold, it does not favor one over another; it simply *is*. There is no ""good"" fortune or ""bad"" fortune, only fortune - the good and the bad that we perceive are only our judgement of our fate. We could just as easily judge differently, or not at all. Nothing happens *to* us, it just *happens*.",Stoicism,1588714731.0,t3_ge6rxr,0.97,749

Marcus Aurelius on getting out of bed,"When you have trouble getting out of bed in the morning, remember that your defining characteristic — what defines a human being — is to work with others. Even animals know how to sleep. And it’s the characteristic activity that’s the more natural one—more innate and more satisfying.

\- Marcus Aurelius, Meditations 8.12 (translation by Gregory Hays)

Amazing that a Roman emperor talks about struggling to get out of bed. Who would have thought. But that aside, there are two things here that I have trouble understanding:

1. He considers working together as a defining human characteristic. Does he think only humans do this? Many animals - e.g. wolves, apes and orcas - hunt in packs, which I would consider ""working together"".

2. It was my understanding that the Stoics consider reason, the ability to act rational, as the one quality that separates man from beast. Does Marcus have a broader definition? Or does he see cooperation as an execution of reason?",Stoicism,1619091412.0,t3_mw2sf0,0.98,743

This quote hit me at another growth stage of my life.

While I do not regret how hard I have worked in improving myself, I now reflect on the why. Health, wealth, discipline, career; all improved. And yet at this moment, at the cusp of reaping what I have sowed, I feel I am the same person I was three years ago; scared. The tiny doubts, the countless 'what ifs', the whispers of impostor all unite in their cabal. I have been enduring a thousand miseries all because I think I need to be more to be 'worthy'. What I have been chasing will not give me what I seek. Chasing that punitive goal has no end. I will continue to improve but not for the aim to be worthy. I am worthy and I have my role to play.

What's your sanity worth?

When something that upsets you happens, take a moment and ask yourself, is this worth sacrificing your peace of mind over?

Is this a situation which requires a response, or are you simply demanding a token of satisfaction to satisfy your ego?

If the latter, ask yourself if letting this go is a price you can pay to maintain your peace of mind. Quite often you will find the price is not so great.

I cant believe that this is happening. This was always something you heard happen to others. Never to you or yours. 

I am still in disbelief. I dont know what to do. I want to cry. I'm a 29 year old guy. Some days I feel I am 10, and today especially so. I have been a stoic practitioner, but it's one thing to be stoic when your boss is being difficult, and another thing when life hangs in the balance.

I have and am doing all the things necessary, (going to the doc, preparing finances, even went in to work). 

But in those lonely moments, while waiting in line, while walking to the store, it hits me. The things that may happen, the worst. And Stoicism goes out of the window.

Not sure why i'm writing here. Not sure I'm seeking stoic advice. I'm pretty sure what the Stoics have said. It's the applying of these ideas that I need help with.  Or maybe I am just venting out because I can't do it anywhere else.

"When in doubt, act like The Rock.","*""Be like The Rock that the waves keep crashing around. It stands unmoved and the raging of the sea falls around it."" Marcus Aurelius, Meditations 4.49*

Many of us may know Marcus Aurelius as a philosopher, an emperor, or something in between. What he is rarely acknowledged for is his skill as a prophet, and no where is this more on display than this passage in Meditations. 

Despite being born thousands of years before Dwayne Johnson (The Rock), Marcus knew what a cultural force and icon he would be, and so he advises us in Meditations to strive to be more like him.

But what does this mean? Are we to model is vigorous workout routine, and remain consistent in our pursuit for physical fitness regardless of the day? Or is the lesson here more broad, in that we should seek to replicate his tireless work ethic when it comes to his career. Perhaps. 

I believe that the lesson here is even more specific, and has to do with the roles the Rock has chosen to play...

# The Rundown & Walking Tall (2004):

If one of your friends were to use the bathroom, and you switched the movie from one of these to the other about 85% of people wouldn't be able to tell the difference, so we'll group these two together. 

In both films The Rock plays a loose cannon tough guy who doesn't play by the rules. Now admittedly this goes against the Stoic principle of remaining calm and not being a slave to one's anger. However, I think the lesson that Marcus expected us to take from these films is the Rocks ability to remain unwavering and collected under pressure. 

In the Rundown The Rock sneaks into a Brazilian mining town, like a spy, to rescue Stiffler and in Walking Tall he fights another man with a goddamn axe. If sneaking into an enemy camp, or fighting with an axe don't qualify as situations that require some level of serenity - frankly I don't know what does. 

At the end of Scorpion King (2002) - which almost made the list - The Rock's love interest tells him that she foresees a period of peace and prosperity coming that would not last forever. What could be more stoic advice then to appreciate the good times, but to understand that they are just as temporary as everything else. 

# The Tooth Fairy (2010)

In this 2010 classic The Rock plays the Tooth Fairy after stealing a dollar from his girlfriend's daughter that was meant for the Tooth Fairy. While this film may have been slammed by critics for being ""unacceptably dull"" it's likely that they just didn't get the nuance beyond this screenplay.

Life is difficult, however turning into the Tooth Fairy overnight is a tall order even for someone as tall as the Rock. Throughout the course of the film Dwayne attempts to take short cuts, and is accused by his Tooth Fairy boss that he has an inability to be optimistic which is his biggest flaw. 

\*\*Spoilers\*\*

It's only when he accepts his responsibility for his own actions and embraces his roll as a Rock that stands unmoved amongst the raging fairies that he's able to get his life back in order for the sake of his new family. 

Marcus, whose arguably largest failing, was the behavior of his son Commodus, likely was referencing the Tooth Fairy as a means for rectifying his own mistakes.

# Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017)

What would you do if you were transported into the avatar of your favorite video game character? This is the existential question that Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle wrestles with WWE style. 

3 lives is all the cast has at their disposal, yet they are faced with life threatening circumstances at ever turn.  Whether it's poisonous snakes, hungry hungry hippos, or Kevin Hart's napoleon complex, the cast is put in harms way at nearly every moment of the film's run time. 

Being stuck in an alien environment with people, and facing as much danger as they do would be enough to make anyone question their involvement. Yet the Rock, in true Dwayne Johnson fashion, puts the team on his insanely proportioned back and delivers textbook leadership, cunning, and an example for how we too can live up to Stoic Principles. 

Sure, the team helped, and he even enlisted a Jonas brother who turned out to be a creepy version of Tom Hank's son, but none of it would have happened if The Rock didn't take Marcus advice and act like a rock. 

# Conclusion:

From Moana to Hobbs & Shaw there are no shortage of examples we can select to illustrate why The Rock was Marcus' choice for carrying the Stoic torch for future generations. Whether it's the mob, super soldiers, giant gorillas, or an earthquake like in San Andreas the Rock remains a Rock when the waters get rough.

Who else practices cold showers?,"I’ve only recently begun taking a cold shower every morning, in combination with some breathing techniques beforehand. The last few days has been a test of my mental will and resilience - I’m slowly finding that although my body reacts to the cold, it is for me to choose to be cold. It’s been a great experience so far, and I’ll be continuing on. 

I meditate after the experience each morning, and I’m finding this is the most mentally resilient I have ever been. Does anyone do this? How has it helped you?",Stoicism,1597354173.0,t3_i98qih,0.97,732
Moving on from breakup,"My ex-girlfriend of two years left me last Sunday and it was so painful. I thought we were going to spend our lives together. At first, I freaked out and pleaded for her to return, which never ends well. Then I clung to the hope that she would eventually miss me if I cut her off. Clinging to that allowed me to get through the first few days and be productive, which is already putting my life in a better place. 

It comes in waves but I find that when I feel low, focusing on improving my situation pushes me through. And when I’m feeling the high, I visualize her leaving forever, and moving on to someone else, because I can handle those thoughts during these moments. I think this is working to pull me out of the darkness, but not run away and bury the pain. It’s only been a few days and I can already feel myself letting her go, without it ripping me apart. 

It’s almost unsettling to see how easy it is to move on if we allow ourselves to. We’re so resilient and adaptable. Life keeps going forward, our nature doesn’t want to hold on, it wants to move forward too. Open up to new experiences and never hold onto negativity. Accept what comes our way and make the best of it that we can. Memento Mori. I think it’s important to remind ourselves of this, because it seems to be helping me. It’s hard but the only way is through, and I’m beginning to see the light at the end of this nightmare. Just wanted to share this if anyone else is feeling lost. Coincidentally, I came across stoicism just a few days before she dumped me.

Today I returned my cat,"About 8 months ago I was driving and heard some faint meowing. I parked my car and went to look for the source, and I found the smallest, cutest kitten. From that moment on she became a member of my family and she brought us so much joy every day. For 8 months I was allowed to love her, to play with her, to watch her grow and to make memories with her. And today I had to return her.

She suddenly became very sick yesterday and after taking her to the emergency vet it was clear that she wasn't going to make it. An aortic thromboembolism, said the vet. Her back legs were completely paralyzed and she was in a lot of pain, and despite the vet's best efforts she wasn't responding to any of the pain medication. It all happened so fast. My husband and I had to decide between taking her to a vet hospital an hour away and allowing her to suffer through all the medical treatments with a minimal chance of survival, or euthanazing her. It wouldn't be fair to make her suffer any more than she already had.

I screamed. I cried. I cursed the heavens. ""It's not fair. Why is this happening? I'm not ready to let her go. She's just a baby. Just a baby. How can I go on after this?"" I threw myself to the floor, pleading she would miraculously jump up and be better. Anyone who's ever experienced the loss of a pet knows how painful it is. But despite me not being ready, it happened anyway. The cart was dragging me along and here I am, kicking and screaming like the last time I lost a pet. And then I remembered that I am not losing her, I am returning her. She was never mine to keep to begin with. I got to experience her love and affection, her presence, for 8 months. And though I wanted it to be so much longer, and make a 1000 more memories with her, instead of grieving what I was never promised, I can be grateful that our paths crossed for 8 beautiful months.

I hurt, oh I hurt. But I also feel a sense of peace. There is nothing I can do to stop death, it is not within my control. The time I've spent practicing stoicism allows me to meet this hardship with more grace than I thought I would be able to. So I will grieve, but not more than is needed, for I can look back at 8 months of memories and those will stay with me for as long as I am alive.

Thank you Mishi, for allowing me to love you, and loving me in return. And though I will cry, I will also honor your memory and smile as I think of you.",Stoicism,1679274445.0,t3_11w3vtz,0.96,732
A Meditation on Memento Mori,"Everything dies.

No matter how massive, how strong, how adaptive.  No matter how famous, how timeless, how immutable.  Everything dies.

From the big bang to the heat death of the universe, one through line weaves itself across the stars and in our lives: entropy, decay.  Even Marcus' rock standing against the raging sea erodes with time.  Even the most mythic heroes and foes of legend fade into oblivion.  Everything dies.

Yet death and decay, while constant, is not cause for despair.  Yes, one day humanity will forget you.  One day the earth will forget humanity.  One day the sun will forget the earth.  One day, the universe will forget the stars.  And yet, we continue to live and love and thrive.  No matter how fleeting, no matter how futile, the stars still shine and we still rise to meet them.  Everything dies.

So what if everything dies?  Do we stand, an unmoving but sea-battered and windswept stone, until we fade into dust?  No, we grow like the trees, sway in the breeze, and follow our natural flow.  The stone is no more impervious to oblivion than we or the trees--yet it is static.  Unshaken, yet whittled to dust like us.  The tree is equally unbothered by its fate, and yet it provides for all.  We humans ought to aspire to be the adaptable and flexible tree, rooted in virtue.  Everything dies.

One hears ""memento mori"" and finds mortality depressing.  Yet it is natural, not just for us but for everything.  It is not a call beckoning us to our ends, but a rally to live naturally and live well.  For despite death, we are now and will always be a part of existence.  Our body decays, but provides beyond death.  If we provide for life after death, why not do so before it?  Everything dies.

No, I will not fatalistically approach my death.  Yet, nor will I deny it.  For why fear or bemoan or deny death if one lives a life fully?  If you fear death, it is because you believe you have not lived as well as you could have.  So, live well in the time that remains; be that a day or a decade.  Everything dies.

This call to remember death is a call to remember virtue.  Do not fool yourself into immortality and viciousness, but embrace your impermanence by living well.  Everything dies.

Everything dies.",Stoicism,1612529017.0,t3_ld6dh1,0.99,734

Memento mori is a consolation to me,"Does anyone else find relief or comfort in the Idea of momento mori?


I find that remembering that I am going to die and that all my mistakes as well as achievements are going to be lost and forgotten to the world in a few years is hugely calming. It sort of takes the pressure off of my mind that my lifespan is not important and I am free to live in a way which I find virtuous without worrying about having to live it permanently.


The death of others is also comforting to me. Not that I find other's deaths good or that death makes me happy, it's just that it makes me happy to know we must all go through death, and everybody will receive respite from their lives regardless of how good or bad it is.


I think this might also come from the fact that I find immortality to be a terrifying idea. Anyone relate??

The Striking Similarities Between Stoicism and Buddhism,"I recently discovered how Stoicism and Buddhism have so many similarities, both in terms of their origins and teachings. So I decided to do some more research and write a blog post about it.

"Stoicism is not just about changing your expectations and your actions, it's also about changing where you place your happiness.","One of the most difficult Stoic practices in my experience has been the practice to shift where I place my happiness. I never really thought about ""where I place my happiness"", I just kind of always lived with some things making me happy and others not so much. 

Stoicism teaches us to place our happiness in our own virtue. This is obvious - virtue is the only thing you can control, so why the hell would you place your happiness anywhere outside of your own control. However, my Stoic practice often made me self-frustrated, tense, etc. Because even though I was acting virtuously, I forgot to place my happiness there. This is arguably one of the most important practices for any Stoic, as you will feel a direct correlation between your level of virtue and your level of happiness.

My first year of progress under Stoicism and Therapy,"This post is not for bragging, I still have a very long way to go. I am writing this to tell you that if I was able to do this, am pretty sure you can too.

I was in a rut for a long time, i mean years. I worked different jobs, had few relationships, had a social life, but i wasn't really doing well. I had a drug problem, health issues, i was very messy, and unproductive, and always bored. Today i am a very different man, I am productive, self-reliant, and finding new interests everyday.

The change started when i started seeing a therapist, to many of my friends, i was ok, i didn't need therapy, but  i started going to therapy to deal with my cigarette addiction. I can't tell you how much therapy helped me find a new perspective towards my actions, and how much time i actually waste. Therapy pointed me towards reading, and when i read about stoicism, it changed my life. I have never found a doctrine so close to what i naturally believed about the nature of life (Logos), our purpose and duty as humans, and what constitutes good and bad. But finding out about stoicism is not enough, i had to start changing my habits and lifestyle to be able to live what i believe. I started doing my bed everyday, and that is it. Regardless of how late i woke up, how lazy i felt, i had to force myself to do the bed everyday. After a month of only that, i started to add a little extra chore, then another, then another. I started reading daily, even if it is just one page, i started exercising/stretching everyday, even if it was just a minute worth of exercise. Starting 2021, i kept a journal, and started a to-do list for the next day. That curbed my drug use and helped me overcome my addiction towards cigarettes. Only after a 45 days of quitting cigarettes, i was running 10 Km every other day, and looking for half marathons to join. I have found a new musical instrument to learn, and most importantly, i can deal with my thoughts and anxiousness, i no longer need to run away from myself.

Just be ready to disappoint the terrible voices in your head telling you 'am too tired', 'how about we skip today', 'there is no reason to do this', or 'I am not good enough to be better'.

Never felt more in control of my life than now. All because of a simple stoic principle,"After many years of overthinking and overanalyzing, up to the point that it ruined things that were meaningful to me I understood that I needed a change. 

Before I started reading and learning stoicism I always had the absurd idea in my head that I could somehow change things that were not myself. Things of ”nature”, things out of my control. Stoicism helped me understand that I could only be in control of myself, other things, things of nature, will always find their own way, much like I found my way. 

I was always obsessed with control, but never truly felt content, no mather how much control I had. I have come to the understanding of why that was. It was because even though I sometimes felt the illusion of being in control of nature, I never really were in control of myself. For I let nature define and control me.

15 points that compress so much (for me),"I am sure none of this is earth-shattering, but it rocked me as a bunch of pieces all fell into place as I was showering one day.

What follows is the sudden product of a long journey of journalling, reading and thinking. It will not map as vividly to your own mindset and precepts as it did mine.

As such, I offer it here in hope it can be a useful schema in your own development. So, in 15 points:

1. You will tend to regret (or regret more) the things you did not do.

2. Therefore it always makes sense to do the right kind of things.

3. The right kind of things are the inklings, hopes and notions in your mind that are recurrent, stable and persistent yet rarely engrossing or distracting.

4. This is because these things come from the stable and long-term aspects of your character, not your moment-to-moment lusts or hungers.

5. When you undertake the right kind of action, the consequences - good or bad - will make sense because they will accord with your values. You may invite grief by acting thus, but the grief will be meaningful.

6. As you conduct yourself this way, the proportion of your life that is meaningful to you will increase in line with how much of it is the consequence of your previous values-based choices.

7. Given all this, it is imperative you find - or find signs of - your values as soon as possible.

8. And then begin acting on these as soon as possible afterwards.

9. Always with a mind to know them more precisely as you evolve and your values become clearer.

10. Because, like it or not, your life circumstances are the product of your previous choices.

11. Because, whether or not you're aware of it, the older you get, the more of your life is the product of your past choices.

12. It is thus wisdom and maturity to accept this and accept that you are responsible for all the of the reasonably foreseeable consequences of your actions.

13. Thus it makes sense to seek to live without regrets - both of action and omission.

14. Yet, as no one is all-knowing, senseless hazard will still visit upon your wise life.

15. But, if you have enough wisdom, any turbulence will be a minor and temporary, lost in the vast calm of that is the estate of a wise life.

These and the relationships between them are still under development on this end. Nevertheless, done is better than perfect, and I hope some of the above is useful in your pursuit of wisdom.",Stoicism,1609039074.0,t3_kkw3b7,0.98,722

I have been using this lesser-known stoic exercise from Seneca for the past 2 months. It has drastically changed my life. I feel happier and have a greater sense of purpose. It's my duty to share it with you.,"I was reading the ‘Moral Letters to Luculias’ by the Stoic philosopher Seneca.

Letter 12 *‘On Old Age’* had some interesting ideas which relate to our motto of ***Live and Die Well***.

The letter starts off with Seneca explaining a situation he had with a builder.

Repairs needed to be made to one of Seneca’s homes.

Unforeseen problems kept popping up (I guess contractors were the same even 2,000 years ago).

Seneca suspected the builder was trying to finesse him for more money.

He probed to see what the issue was, but the builder insisted he was doing everything in his power.

The builder explained the issue came from the material of the house being ‘old’.

Seneca realized the builder was right and was confronted with this thought:

*“What has the future in store for me, if stones of my own age are already crumbling?”*

This led him to contemplate his mortality as was typical of Stoics.

# Nature Wins

The ageing process is illusive.

The days go by so slowly, and we don’t notice ourselves getting older.

But as we age, more proof begins to appear.

When it comes, the realizations are shocking.

I remember when I was younger and would move tremendous weights in the gym with no issue.

Today, entering my 30s, I already notice a difference in the amount of punishment my body can take.

What would take me 2 days to recover from now takes 3 to 4 days.

At age 17, I had no injuries and my body felt like it was made out of rubber.

It was malleable and could easily bounce back from snap-city.

Today, I have to avoid certain exercises which trigger those injuries.

At age 15, I could eat junk food every day and not put on any weight.

Now, if I have a bender and cheat on my diet over the weekend, that scale will be setting new personal records.

I remember being 10 years old and poking fun at a family member

She got upset because I called her Morgan Freeman.

I called her that because she has those small dots on her skin Morgan Freeman has.

They are called Dermatosis Papulosa Nigra and are common in black people.

The other day whilst looking in the mirror I saw a few of those dots.

*“They weren’t there before!”*

I had to laugh at the irony of it all.

These things are small and trivial

But are evidence of a decaying body.

Reminders of mortality.

Proof that our meat suits have an expiry date.

Yes, I am young and strong.

But one day, I will be weak and withered.

Instead of running away from this natural process, Seneca invites us to embrace it.

He explains how things often get better right before the decline.

Fruit reaches its peak flavour before getting too ripe and falling off the tree.

Wine tastes better with age before going bad and spoiling.

Ageing allows you to let go of the emotional and psychological baggage which weighed you down during your youth.

Ageing done right is a stripping away process.

Allowing you to move away from the physical to the spiritual.

# Requiem for a King

Seneca explains how Pacuvius, a Roman elite, would conduct his own memorial service.

The service would have wine and feasting.

The halls will be filled with people celebrating his life.

It would climax with Pacuvius being carried from the dinner table to his bed whilst people chanted,

*“He has lived, he has lived!”*

Pacuvius would wake up the next day and continue business as usual.

Seneca instructs us to follow his example but for noble reasons, not narcissism.

*“Every day ought to be regulated as if it closed the series, as if it rounded out and completed our existence…let us go to our sleep with joy and gladness;* ***let us say: I have lived;*** ***the course which Fortune set for me Is finished***\*. And if God is pleased to add another day, we should welcome it with glad hearts.”\*

— Seneca

When you wake up, assume that day is all you have.

Don’t waste time stressing about the future or worrying about the past.

Do what you need to do in the present.

This allows you to focus on what matters and not waste time on petty affairs.

It allows you to be grateful.

It gives you clarity.

Steve Jobs carried out a similar exercise.

*“For the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: ‘If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?’ And whenever the answer has been no for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.”*

— Steve Jobs

This exercise will provide you with immense clarity.

Farewell,

Isaac

The power of the shrug. 🤷‍♀️,"Our brain reacts to our body, and how we act can influence how we think. Think of your body posture, for example: Standing up straight, keeping your chin up and walking tall can actually make you feel more confident, proud, and powerful. Using a stress ball can relieve tension and reduce blood pressure. Taking deep breaths can calm us down and help clear our minds. I thought I'd share something I do to help me stay Stoic when the defecation hits the oscillation.

I shrug. A lot. This is something my friends have pointed out to me over the years, but I've never stopped doing it. ^(I also use the shrug emoji a lot too.) Something about the physical action, which as a human I have naturally associated with indifference, helps me actually achieve a higher degree of indifference. Obviously, and I want to emphasize this, Stoicism is not about 100% indifference all of the time. But in times where it is very beneficial to remain calm, cool, and collected, beginning my thought process with the physical act of shrugging does wonders to keep me centered.

Stoicism defused a potentially violent confrontation,"I wanted to share an anecdote that happened to me recently. A few days ago I was taking a train downtown and saw a man waiting on the platform. By his body language I could already tell he was full of anger and frustration. He was holding a slice of pizza and a can of Pepsi, and maliciously ripping toppings off the pizza and throwing them on the floor. 

As we got on to the train, it was immediately apparent that he was going to cause trouble. Within seconds, he was yelling at strangers, staring them down, getting in their face and insulting them, trying to scare and intimate old ladies and throwing pizza all over the place, and just generally causing a disturbance to other passengers. He then shook his can of Pepsi and sprayed it all over the train. Many people moved but I just stood there and quietly listened to my music. I took out my phone to change a song, to which he immediately saw me and responded with, ""are you filming me with your fucking phone?"" even though it had been pointed nowhere near him, nor had I any interest in having videos of this man on my phone. He then targeted me to focus his anger and frustration, which I was honestly grateful for as it drew his attention away from innocent passengers. He got within inches of my face, threatening to hit me verbally as well as taking swings at the air around me. He shouted in my face again about filming him even though I didn't even have my phone out anymore. He continued trying to provoke me, saying things like ""hit me you fucking pussy, I dare you"", and a variety of other things to try to get me to fuel his self-destructive tendencies. He then spilled some of his Pepsi on me, and spat on my arm (it should come as no surprise to any of you that he was not wearing a mask). This carried on for several minutes without stopping. 

Throughout this entire ordeal, I just calmly stared directly into his eyes and didn't look away for a second. I could sense the lifetime of pain and mistreatment this man endured, and his inability to cope with it. His anger and frustration, his thoughts that causing fear and intimidation to others was the only way in which he could get any power or respect in this world. I could see genuine stress from the frabricated thought that I was filming him, and his emotional reaction to that fiction. I simply continued to stare at him, unflinching, not reacting emotionally, not saying a word, not choosing to fight but also not choosing to back down. The act of doing nothing took all of his power away. I could see the discomfort and insecurity stemming from another man looking into his eyes for an extended period of time. The acts themselves, of silence and eye contact, are nothing. But I could see the fear in his eyes at the realization that no matter what he did or said to me, he was not in control of my actions or emotions.  Without realizing, the train had already reached the next stop. Part of me wanted to ask the man if he needed help, but I knew his ego would not allow him to accept it and it would likely make the situation worse. So I pointed to the door, and simply said, ""Go."" He immediately gathered his things and walked straight out the door without saying another word to me or the other passengers. 

While I do not wish to pity people like this, I genuinely hope that he was able to learn something from this situation, that there is another way to approach life other than fear, intimidation, and emotional outbursts. As I learned so much from this situation about the intentions of a man, the reactions behind emotions, how flimsy is a house built on a foundation of foolishness and arrogance, and how much one's mind can fabricate, react, and emote from literal nothing.  

As I reflect, I recall a quote that helped me keep my cool and stay true to my convictions.

Being Stoic does not mean being a doormat,"Stoicism is often depicted in various forms of media and literature as being ""emotionless"". I feel that it is important to clarify, being stoic does not mean being a doormat. It does not mean to suppress your emotions, your persona, and your livelihood. That is a one way ticket to bitterness and frustration. It does not mean to see how much suffering you can endure, you will only be the king of your own mental prison. Stoicism means that regardless of whatever your circumstances, obstructions, and emotions are, you remain unfazed and respond accordingly in a manner such that is not influenced by your external or internal circumstances. You can most certainly be stoic and acknowledge ""negative"" emotions and undesirable circumstances. It just means that your actions are not influenced by them, it does not warrant lack of action. Do not confuse stoicism for suppression of emotion, that will guarantee depression. Stoicism is a celebration of your character, and to honour your virtue, and continue to develop your character. Do not confuse stoicism with being harmless or docile, while it is great to avoid all unnecessary conflict, that is not reality. Do not be afraid of confrontation and challenge, again, no matter the circumstance, even if the world is burning, your response and character is to remain unfazed and you respond accordingly. Being stoic means to be a warrior, in whichever way you believe is true to you and to confront all challenges and obstructions in your life such that, your response and goal is unaffected by your external or internal factors. Stoicism is the highest form of self-expression, not self-repression.",Stoicism,1614621793.0,t3_lvftnu,0.98,714
Accepting Pain,"Yesterday I had the chance to practice this. One of my clients is an international 5 star hotel. The IT manager asked if I could attend urgently and I did. Problem took a bit longer than expected into Friday night but we fixed it.

The IT manager was so grateful that he wanted to offer me lunch, then paused and asked me if I was in a relationship. He wanted to offer me a free room. When I said no ( I have been single for 7 years), he looked disappointed and asked me why as I was a nice guy.

Onto the stoicism part. I'll admit: I felt pain (I really want a relationship and to have children.). But as usual, I ran away from it. So there I was, driving home, and feeling pained. Then it struck me: Why am I resisting pain? Maybe I should invite pain. Maybe I should allow it. So I decided that yes, I felt pain and that it is welcome to be felt by my emotional self. After all it was true and part of myself, no need to deny it.

The moment I accepted it, I calmed down. Its like I ""forgot about it"". I accepted it, moved on, and was and still am at peace with it.

This in itself is quite gratifying (not the actual action of being positive but the act of you not giving in to the situation. The action of being positive in a crap situation feels like anything but!). Currently going through a break-up and keep reminding myself of her but I instantly refocus my mind because these thoughts aren't helpful, this feels gratifying which further strengthens my mind when I think of our relationship.

I've been reading this book again and I think we too easily see being positive as something we should just do, but we can work it to our favor by seeing that when we refrain from doing something which perhaps is not in our best interests, the refraining may not feel nice as we're missing out but the action of missing out by choice is a powerful move which in itself should feel gratifying.

So shitty situations are shitty but we can always gain something from it and don't have to feel helpless. I'm assuming the same can be said for amazing situations (new job, car, lottery win) restraint in this situation would also feel gratifying.

This is something I'm still working on, especially when Life is going well. This is possibly harder than when Life isn't going well.

"I lost someone very special to me. In return, I found myself.","After going through intense heartbreak and losing someone dear to my heart, I'd nowhere to turn. I considered therapy, but my very niche health insurance doesn't cover it.

So, I turned to stoicism. I'd considered the idea and practice before, but never too seriously.

Now it's time to get serious.

My entire life I would let my thoughts and emotions control me, and anyone who tried to help would say ""it's all in your head,"" or ""change your attitude.""

I thought they were all saying the same unhelpful thing on repeat, so I ignored it.

No, it didn't change anything immediately, but accepting it in my mind was the most helpful and important step on becoming the best version of myself.

How do I accept the fact that I will never be loved romantically?,"I have been very unattractive to women since I was 14 and puberty made it worse. I'm 20 and there isn't any hope for me in the future for sure, in terms of looks. Like any young man, I have strong sexual needs as well and also, I want to settle down one day with someone to start a family but I just don't see that happening. I look in the mirror and feel disgusted sometimes, and I say to myself ""why would anyone even romantically love me?"". I just want to live this life happily without seeking love. I just can't seem to do that. What bothers is that when I go out or on anywhere else, I have this sense of jealousy when I see a young couple in love with each other. It doesn't make me angry, just very sad. I makes me think ""man I wish I was attractive"". 

&#x200B;

Now the Stoic approach to this is very simple, I can't control the perception of attractiveness in someone else's mind. I can only change what's in my control. The only thing I want to do in this life is that I somehow stop the pursuit of finding love in a person. I just want to accept solitude forever but I can't seem to do that. Maybe I'm biologically programmed this way but still I want to get rid of this. I want to go out and do stuff I like without having an urge of wanting to be with someone romantically. I just want to get rid of this.

Envy is a stupid feeling that only exists to make us feel bad,"Let's say you win a million dollars. You're really happy and you buy a new house, a new car and you're having a great time.

However, you find out everyone else in the world won 10 million dollars and is also very happy. They start buying bigger houses and more cars than you.

Suddently you're feeling bad because you think you're the worst person on the planet. That your life is mediocre when compared to everyone else.

However, YOU WON A MILLION DOLLARS! You were having a great time before you found out you weren't the best. Just because the others are now richer than you that doesn't mean you aren't! You have a great house! You don't have any financial problems! You have a great car!

The old me would have really gotten upset at the situation and felt like my whole world was ending due to me being really codependent in the past.

However, I thanked her for letting me care for her and love her for this semester in school. I was never entitled to her, so the fact we had the relationship we did for 4 months has felt amazing.

I am affected by what is currently happening in Gaza.,"I feel like nothing makes any sense anymore.

UPDATE: Stoics are too passive,"After reading the responses on the last post, I remain resolute in my conclusion that modern practitioners of stoicism are too passive. Passiveness / pacifism are not good and virtuous in and of themselves. In the comments people were saying I had a misunderstanding of Stoicism  and how it is not pacifism per se, I agree and explain this distinction below, and that I have not read the stoics. I disagree, I have read Aurelius, Seneca, and Epictetus (the latter of which is my favorite).

&#x200B;

Don't behave cowardly and be passive and put up with it because it is cowardice masquerading as virtue. Defend your honor. There was a time when men of the past understood this idea and even dueled and put their life on the line in order to defend their honor. I am NOT saying that we go back to dueling or escalate to violence, only using that example to indicate that once upon a time men were courageous and masculine and would be willing to fight to defend their honor. To those who are going to misconstrue everything I have said, here are my basic claims so you dont put words in my mouth: 

1) Stoicism is fantastic for dealing with life events out of your control eg getting let go from your work, getting broken up with, dealing with an infirmity etc.

2) Stoicism is not fantastic for social life events in your control that require action. In practice, stoicism is very close to pacifism by modern practitioners of stoicism. This is because stoicism in some sense emasculates you because you wont have the proper masculine aggression that is needed in situations like defending your honor when you're getting bullied, teased, ridiculed, having your gf getting harassed by men, youre out with your mom and someone touches her etc, your inaction would be the result of your calm rational stoic principles that would be absolutely useless here.  When your kid is getting bullied, what do you tell them? Son be stoic and let the bullies take your money, hit you, deride you and be effectively labeled the biggest wimp in the school because as long as you have virtuous thoughts that all that matters little man. 

I am aware that stoicism is not pacifism. Dont misrepresent me. I understand Aurelius was an emperor of rome who led battles against germanic tribes. Only that in practice, modern adherents of stoicism would not encourage aggression or standing up for yourself and your honor/ your gf / your mother etc in the false name of virtue and letting things be and not allowing aggression get to you bc we're stoics and we should not let emotions get to us and we should be rational. However it is clear that this approach does not work in these social situations and not taking action is extremely cowardly.

3) I am not saying go guns blazing with violence or 10/10 aggression, only that you have the tools of aggression, potential for violence, a willingness for confrontration etc and use them judiciously in amounts that fit the situation should you be presented with a circumstance like above.

The bottom line: stoicism is not a one size fits all bandage for all your problems. When stoicism is helpful: for things out of your control like a break up, an illness, kid got into a car accident, staying calm and composed in these situations is extremely good and honorable.

When stoicism is bad: when guys are touching / flirting with your girlfriend and youre standing there idly and meekly because your stoic beliefs have hindered your aggression. Your kid is being bullied, youre out with your mom and someone touches her etc. I am not saying you beat them to a pulp, use rational judgment when deciding how much force, aggression, and potential violence is needed to end the situation without being a coward, yet avoid the other extreme of being a volatile angry mad man who wants to fight anyone who looks at you funny.

On one hand, eating meat is human nature, we are clearly omnivores and have eaten meat as a species for as long as we've been around. 
However in modern day, eating meat isn't a requirement to live a healthy life, and the mass production of meat is widely thought to be inefficient and cruel, so using reason and the information we have available, eating meat wouldn't be the virtuous choice.

I wanted to share a random fact that the founder of Stoicism Zeno was actually black. This of course isn’t to make it woke because it does NOT matter what he looked like, but Diogenes in his work Life and Times of Imminent Philosophers tells us that Zeno the Phonecian from Cyprus was a swarthy man “hence he was called the Egyptian vine-branch”.  Zeno after being shipwrecked in Athens started reading the works of Socrates(Plato) and subsequently founded the school of Zenoism/Stoicism.  People may ask what is my point and it is simply me venting. I get picked on by woke black people for my deep affection of Ancient Greek work and because they are woke, they are ignorant of the fact that Zeno was actually black.

Ta da and farewell,"Dear Stoic Community,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. I am writing to inform you that I have decided to step away from the Stoicism subreddit for the time being. While this community has been a source of inspiration and learning for me, I have noticed an increasing number of posts that veer off the core principles of Stoicism.

The essence of Stoicism lies in the pursuit of wisdom, virtue, and inner tranquility through the acceptance of what we cannot change and the diligent focus on what is within our control. Lately, I have observed an influx of posts that deal with personal struggles such as loneliness, loss, and betrayal. While these experiences are undoubtedly significant and deserve empathy and support, they are more suited for spaces dedicated specifically to personal support and self-help.

It is my sincere hope that the Stoicism subreddit will regain its focus on the teachings and practices that have brought us all together. Until such a time arises, I will be seeking out or possibly contributing to a new community that adheres more closely to the principles of Stoicism.

Friend keeps using N word,"Im from Australia, im of african descent, my friend of asian descent used the n word around me and instantly apologised and said they can’t help it and its a bad habit, i told them “its probably best to not use this word if u have to apologise to me every time you use it”. Then again a few weeks later they used the word and apologised and I again addressed them and told them that its affecting our friendship and to stop using the word, they minimized it by saying everyone is getting soft and reminiscing about their younger days when everyone did. They then mentioned they can use the F word as an example (derogatory for gays) if they were angry as it isn’t offensive then because “once they are angry they have no morals”. I called them immature and left it at that after accepting their apology. What would you do in a situation like this?

The word doesn’t necessarily bother me but the social stigma around it is very loud. And the fact that when used by a non black person, its responded to with gasps and apologies before im even able to react.

Ryan Holiday and the Virtue of “Drag story-time”,"I was going to post a picture but it seems I’m not allowed to in the community (I don’t get on Reddit or the internet too often.) Ryan Holiday tweeted today about how he was putting on a “Drag story-time” at his bookstore, The Painted Porch. I refuse to acknowledge that exposing young children to explicitly sexual entertainment, such is the case at Drag shows, is actually virtuous and I’m actually the immoral one for wanting to halt “progress.” I would also argue anyone saying that it is virtuous needs a serious reexamination of their values. Which of the 4 virtues exactly is being ticked off when exposing children to sexual entertainment? I don’t want to get too political but this is the nature of the conversation. It seems as though Ryan, and a lot of Stoics quite frankly, take an incredibly surface level and emotionally satisfying approach to dealing with politics. I feel like as long as Ryan thinks he’s “on the right side of history” he can do whatever he wants, including children drag shows. I find it odd that during his daily email, he made some long screed about how terrible Jan 6th was, but I didn’t hear a word about the entire summer of riots earlier. Why? Those rioters were on the right side of history and were claiming they want to end racism and progress. It doesn’t matter if communities were destroyed and people lost their lives, they claimed to be the good guy. Either call it all out or call out nothing. Why should I take this guy seriously when he’s painting a dishonest view of the political world and advocating for drag shows for children? Lmk your thoughts",Stoicism,1657751049.0,t3_vyfq04,0.56,10
How can I accept that I will never gonna be able to get revenge on my worst bully?,"I've done it before on my cousin who bullied me for years and it felt good that I've finally freed myself from the trauma he caused me. I only got little punishment for it because I was still a minor at the time. But the triumphant feeling only lasted for a few months because I remembered that I have another bully who is just as worse. So I prepared for a few months for getting ready for my next revenge. I bought a heavy solid weapon, one ranged non-lethal weapon, and a sharp object. I grew my forearm muscle by swinging the heavy solid weapon for a few months and hitting my punching bag repeatedly as hard as I could everyday till I get tired. I improved on handling the sharp object by practicing using it everyday. I got rid of incriminating media and stuff in my house to not get additional charges. But by the time I was ready to face my bully after mustering up the courage for months, I have reached the legal age which makes it now impossible for me to get away with what I'm going to do with that bully. 

But the thing is, I can't let go of the anger I have towards him, because during the months of my preparation for my supposedly revenge, I recalled every single shitty memory I had with him to fill my heart with rage and use that anger to motivate me towards my goal and because of that I realized that he's actually the worst bully I ever had in my life. He belittled me, he always gave me unsolicited help which convinced me that I am incapable, he emasculated me, he humiliated me, he ridiculed my intelligence, he always invaded my personal space,  he forced me to do humiliating shit, he broke my stuff, he borrowed stuff from me and never returned it, he used my bedroom as his jerk-off space, he made fun of my parents, he did all of this while pretending to be my friend and using me for almost a decade. This is really messing with my mind and I can't even go through a day without having an anger outbursts.

Even though I know I'm now old enough to go to prison, I still feel like doing it. Because I feel like I wasted a lot of time and effort on preparing if I don't do it. And I feel like I just threw away my not-so-legal rare media and rare stuff that I worked hard to get for nothing if I don't do it. And I'm really chasing for that cathartic feeling followed by the act of revenge considering how much tremendous mental suffering he caused on me, I imagine it would feel so good again to release all of this mental burden.

I'm stuck in this cycle were I would feel confident on getting revenge on him and then on another day I will become depressed after getting a reality check that I will never receive justice on my own way. I've been like this for a more than a month now.",Stoicism,1671636949.0,t3_zrqyfn,0.53,2
Would an ancient stoic in today's world be a social justice warrior?,"The main tenets of stoicism deal with being virtuous, doing the right thing, and taking action on what you believe is right. Everyone of course has their set of morals, but in stoicism we're meant to try to be objective and selfless with our morals and acting in-line with those morals is extremely important.

This lead me to the thought that ancient stoics have a lot in common with what we call ""social justice warriors"" today. However after thinking about it, I have some reservations about whether they really are similar (I believe they are quite opposite actually).

I'm curious to see what others think and why.",Stoicism,1647367400.0,t3_tevefj,0.53,3
"A woman cheated on her girlfriend with me, and I feel like I should feel regret, but I don't.","With how stoicism is focused on being a decent and respectful human being, and doing what is good for other people, I know what I did wasn't good and I should have rejected that woman since I knew she was probably cheating, or at least regret doing it after the fact.

But I don't, and I don't think that's right.

It might be it's how we've been told as men that scoring is good no matter what, or it even makes you cool to make someone cheat, being told ""if she cheats its her mistake, she has to be faithful not you king"", something I've been told multiple times.

So i know what i allowed to happen is wrong and may cause pain to people that don't deserve it, a non-stoic move in itself, but an even more non-stoic thing is that I still don't feel much regret or sorrow towards it, since I've largely been told it's cool and alright to do, and I don't know if i would be able to say no if I was in that situation again, so I don't think I'v learned from mistakes and become better either.

Any ideas, reasons for this thinking, or just thoughts about the situation in regards to stoicism are welcome.",Stoicism,1667379872.0,t3_yk030y,0.45,0
Marcus Aurelius couldn't keep his d*** in his pants,"He had 13 children. He loved to fuck, and felt super guilty about it.

Seneca may have been exiled from Rome for fucking the Emperor's sister or something.

But most importantly, these men were human.

They did their best to uphold the idea of the virtuous man, and they all failed, and thats okay, because they are human.

And as much as we must dispell the notion that stoics seek to get rid of emotion, we must also fispell the idea that our heros were these perfect people.

They were flawed. They had vices and temptations, challenges of character and tough decisions to make. Some of which they failed at.

And that is perfectly fine. We still remember them thousands of years later, not in spite of their flaws, but because of their flaws. And their desire to strive past them in the healthiest way (they could see) and to always seek to challenge themselves to be better, and to akways press on with the lessons from your failures learned.

I feel like I permanently ruined my life at 25,"I’m 25 years old and I got a contrast MRI 4 months ago and I feel like I ruined my life with the contrast. Nuero ordered it because I had a ‘complex migraine’ and visual disturbance with a history of meningitis as a baby. I don’t know why he ordered the first MRI with contrast, they usually do without it the first time around. 

The MRI tech never had me read the med guide stating trace amounts of the heavy metal retains pretty much indefinitely or I would’ve turned it down. They told me it’s water-soluble and all gone in 24 hours. I found out about retention after and went down the gadolinium rabbit-hole, reading all the horror stories and bad experiences people had. Also found a FB group of people suffering from toxicity from it and other anecdotal reports that did not help. 

I essentially had a mental breakdown that landed me in the psych ward for a week. I can’t cope with knowing that I have it in my brain and body forever, even if nothing happens. I’m physically fine (so far) and I don’t want medical advice but I just cannot mentally come to terms with this. I feel completely unsafe in my own body now and have been dissociating so much. 

I do have anxiety and OCD but this just took them over the top. I’m currently doing therapy with a combination of CBT and EMDR, but it hasn’t helped much. It’s only been a few session so far. My primary doc thinks I’ll probably need an antidepressant prescription to get over this but I’m hesitant to go down that road. I’ve been suffering over this with nonstop anxiety and depression for 4 months and I feel so hopeless. I’d appreciate any advice, guidance, or perspective.

Edit: I would like to add that I’m also having a hard time forgiving myself because part of the reason I didn’t want to refuse it is to not make the doctor mad or mess with his diagnosis. And I was also thinking of the $300 copay I might have to pay if I have to have another one.

I'm supposed to protect him from the dangers of this world but I can't even protect him from my fucking self. I don't mean to hurt him in any way possible but it seems like I keep unintentionally damaging him. I don't know what to do. Just an hour ago i was attempting to get him off my bed so that he can go to his as it's night time and I didn't want him to get scolded(he has a tendency to take forever to get on the bed) and I thought he got his footing when I lifted him up but he didn't. He fell backwards in a kneeling type position and then he fell back and hit his head hard. The sound was fucking horrifying. As he hit his head he cried Mama! Mama! Man that was fucking hard to listen to man 😢. Then he started crying and I held him up. He held his head as he was crying and I don't know what to fucking do man, i feel so fucking guilty. He's okay now and is on his bed but there's this huge bump that hurts on his head and I just can't keep myself together when i think about it. Not the first time he's hit his head because of me and i didn't mean to. I never mean to and yet he still gets fucking hurt. I've never had thoughts about ending my life and I never will but i just think i might. Thank God 🙏 he was seen to by my mom and is okay now but I don't know, i don't know what to do.


Hey guys I appreciate the comments. The reason why I needed to get it out was because it's not the first time I accidentally hurt him when I had no intention to. It sucks knowing that i could possibly hurt him when trying to help him and when i do remember i try to be mindful but I'm a fairly forgetful person so it doesn't always register.

My girlfriend posted a video of her shaking her ass with her male friends and I am devastated by it.,"My girlfriend (22) and I (22) have been together for almost a year. We are doing a long distance thing where we meet once a month. We are not technically in a relationship but we both are extremely attached with eachother and are keeping things unlabelled yet exclusive. We treat eachother like we're in a relationship and the reason for not getting into a relationship yet is other reasons and not related to us.

She lives in a different city and goes out with her friends quite often. She is a very popular and attractive girl where guys hit on her often. but when it comes to her, she is extremely reserved, doesn't give other guys much space and has clear cut boundaries with guys. This is something i like about her. But since past month, she has been going out with the gang in which 2-3 guys have already made a move on her ( for which i completely have no problem because i trust her and her boundaries). They went together for drinking, night outs, parties. They even make a lot of sexual references for jokes, that dude gives her the coat if she feels cold. I mean i have zero problem with all the above because it's her life she can do whatever she want. But I felt like things went overboard when she posted a reel of them hanging out that night where for fun she has shaked her ass with a guy and others were looking at her and laughing. I completely lost my shit this was way too much. It rattles me up that she says that she doesn't like enjoy a lot hanging with that gang yet she goes around shaking her ass like what?!?!?

I'm not a narrow minded person or a fucking bigot. But this is actually something which bothered me because she is not a person who used to dance like this and give ideas to these guys. My question is, does she enjoy that attention? why does she have to do that when we have something stable going on.

Now the issue is i dropped a text saying it wasn't right thing to do and it irks me i told. She is still in shock that i said this since usually i don't have any problem with her lifestyle but this actually affected me. now she's sending me ss of her friends saying that, the dance she did is normal and Iam being controlling.

I am the last person when it comes to being controlling. Call me old fashioned, but i date to marry. So i see a wife material in her and i don't want my girl to go around shake her ass infront of guys who have interest towards her and she has also told me that she is moderately comfortable with them. I feel dissappointed and feel like my whole perception of her is wrong. Right now we haven't sorted it out and I'm waiting for her to say something. I can't go down and say sorry because i haven't done anything wrong. I have no problem with her dancing and all, but shaking her ass that way is no way okay for me!

This feels like a therapy subreddit more than a stoic one..,"Seriously.. Too many people seem to come here thinking making a post on reddit and reading their responses will cure inner suffering. Honestly seems quite silly. Must have something to do with popular culture thinking stoic == no emotion or pain.   


The pain/anxiety/affliction aint gonna go away until it's meant to. Reading a few books won't make it disappear. Posting on reddit won't make it go away. Eventually it will fade, as all things do, whether it's next week or after this life ends. The negative emotions aren't bad though, they just feel bad.  


 Anxiety isn't bad, it feels bad for sure, but it's kept our species from being easy meals to predators.

Loneliness isn't bad. Again it may feel bad, but without loneliness, humanity would again be prey to predators. We only rose to our place in the world by collaborating and working with others. Without loneliness, we wouldn't have collaborated, and well we'd still be running from lions.  


Depression isn't bad, without it humanity would've fell into complacency because without it, why improve things?  


Stoicism won't erase your emotions. It won't make you a tin man without feeling. What it will do is allow you accept these seemingly negative emotions for what they are, and realize that they aren't bad/good. Things will still feel bad and good, because those emotions will always exist, but you won't spend your life trying to dodge pain and grasp at pleasure.

"Genuinely curious, why should I live if no one can love me","I don’t have a single friend. They all abandoned me for various reasons or they betrayed me. I always was treated like an option or just a background character. Never treated like a *friend*. I’ve never had a boyfriend or a girlfriend before because I am physically unattractive.

I’ve never felt proper love. I’ve been alone, ignored, treated like shit by nearly everyone around me, stranger or not. I can’t make friends, but either way, I don’t really want to because I can’t trust or tolerate anyone anymore after being alone for so long.

hi! i'm 19 (f) and i need advices.,"hi everyone :) like i said in the title i need some help for this case.
I'm in a relationship with my boyfriend (18) and next january is our third anniversary.
I have an anxious attachment ( i don't know where I got it, never had a boyfriend before etc, so all that i can say that i'm looking at my past, but that's not the point  and i don't want to talk about it) but my boyfriend is vere communicative, he really loves me and he shows that trough actions, so i'm not worried about him, i trust him, 
but sometimes the thoughts get really dark, everytime I have one i help myself with some self talk, i do things that I love, but there's one thought that i can't escape from: when he goes out in the evening with his group ( there are some girls ofc and  i have some insecurities about them, but i'm working on it), one night it was 2.30am and he walked this girl to her house because she lives in a dangerous area, when he got home he told me everything, why he did that,  he even told me he was sorry because he wrote that only when he arrived at home.

AI simulated conversation between Marcus Aurelius and Buddha,"I tried posting this to r/Buddhism however it got removed for being a ""low-effort post""... I was simply trying to stimulate conversation in a community with similar interests as mine (you know, the whole point of Reddit...) Anyways, I prompted Chat GPT to simulate a conversation between Marcus Aurelius and the Buddha given I am interested in the similarities between these two teachings that originated in completely different parts of the world and completely different cultures. 

Sure, here's a hypothetical conversation between Marcus Aurelius, the Stoic philosopher and Roman Emperor, and Buddha, the spiritual teacher and founder of Buddhism.

**Marcus Aurelius**: Greetings, Buddha. It is an honor to meet you. I have long admired your teachings and your wisdom.

**Buddha:** Thank you, Marcus Aurelius. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I have heard of your reputation as a great philosopher and leader.

**Marcus Aurelius:** I have always believed in the importance of living a virtuous life and striving to be the best version of oneself. I find that the Stoic philosophy resonates with me in this regard.

**Buddha:** I understand. In my teachings, I also emphasize the importance of cultivating a virtuous character and living a life of mindfulness and compassion.

**Marcus Aurelius:** Yes, I have heard that you teach about the impermanence of all things and the importance of detachment from worldly desires. How do you reconcile this with the Stoic belief in living in harmony with nature and accepting what we cannot change?

**Buddha:** While it is true that I teach about the impermanence of all things, I also believe that we should strive to live in the present moment and appreciate the beauty of life. We can practice detachment without becoming apathetic or indifferent to the world around us. The key is to cultivate an inner peace and contentment that is not dependent on external circumstances.

**Marcus Aurelius:** I see. In Stoicism, we believe that the key to happiness is to focus on the things that are within our control and accept the things that are outside of our control. We also believe in the power of reason and self-discipline in shaping our thoughts and actions.

**Buddha:** That is a wise philosophy. In Buddhism, we also emphasize the importance of cultivating wisdom and discipline to overcome the suffering that arises from our attachment to desires and our aversion to pain.

**Marcus Aurelius:** I can see that there are many similarities between our philosophies. We both believe in the importance of living a virtuous life and developing inner strength and resilience. It is refreshing to find common ground with someone from a different culture and tradition.

**Buddha:** Indeed, Marcus Aurelius. We may come from different backgrounds, but our shared commitment to the pursuit of wisdom and enlightenment unites us. It is an honor to have this conversation with you.

I found the result interesting, to say the least. Hopefully, I don't offend anyone in this subreddit with this experiment. I'm interested to hear anyone else's thoughts on the AI output.",Stoicism,1682163652.0,t3_12v3fvg,0.52,2

How (24m) to get over oneitis/crush (22f) that’s completely out of my league?,"So, I’ve \[24M\] had this intense crush on this woman \[22F\] for about 3 years now. I don’t know her personally, but we have some mutual friends and I’ve seen her at certain events here and there like house parties and such.

She’s so beautiful and pretty and I’ve been infatuated with her ever since I saw her. The problem is, is that she’s completely out of my league. She’s a well-known dancer in our community and has thousands of followers on her Instagram and TikTok. She’s super popular with many friends and a great social life, comes from a nice supportive family and rich background.

Meanwhile, there’s me, a 24-year-old loser virgin that’s still in university and living with his parents. I only have 3 friends and a lackluster social life. I have no relationship experience whatsoever due to my struggles with my mental health and abusive home situation that has held me back tremendously.

My girlfriend made an interesting argument.,"Ok. A little background:

I used to be really depressed after my ex broke up with me. To the suicidal point... long story short, I found stoicism and it pulled me out of the depressive spiral and I got a lot better to the point I'm at today. I've always loved philosophy and ideas and thinking, and finding stoicism was like a ""gift from god"" because I've always been naturally kind of stoic and I could actually put my interest in philosophy towards a way of life and living. And finally, me and a long time friend recently reconnected after a weird history and now we're dating... it's great and she's kinda ""interested"" in this stoicism thing I talk about and how it brought me out of my depression. 

(Also, by no means do I consider myself a stoic. I am young, I am reading, and I am practicing. This is for debate/answers/opinions.)

Anyway:

Whenever we talk about stoicism, she understands the basic premises and I believe her, but there's one argument she makes that keeps me thinking and I don't really have a counter to. 

I tell her that my ultimate goal in life is to reach the point of the unattainable 'Stoic Sage' as many of the stoics mention, or the 'perfect man' in terms of stoic principles. But the thing is, she mentions hitler, and if talking about hitler offends you just leave because I'm not gonna deal with that. Her argument is basically that hitler did terrible, awful things, and he'll be remembered forever, and even if I, or someone else were to become the 'Stoic Sage,' we would never really be remembered as well as hitler is remembered. Of course, the people that knew us would remember us and be like: ""oh what a wonderful person he/she was,"" but that's it, that'd be all, only a tight-knit group of people would be 'aware' of us. I understand that it isn't the goal of a stoic to be remembered, but I think my girlfriend's point is something like: ""what's the point of being a stoic and doing good if it's not going to 'amount' to anything or really 'matter' after we're gone?""

Please feel free to ask any questions to clear anything up or if something was confusing. She really got me thinking with this and I wanted to debate it with more knowledgeable people and maybe find some answers for her.

Ignoring texts etc,"What do you do if someone is intentionally ignoring your texts? You’re able to find out through time and deduction that they’re doing it intentionally as a form of disrespect or to test you.
Would a stoic just accept the insult and move on and do nothing? What if you wanted something from the person like a relationship or information of some kind. On a broader note, what if someone directly verbally insults you? 
What would it mean if you insult someone back for insulting you? Or if you insult someone for intentionally ignoring you, and then moving on, instead of just moving on.  Is that considered narcissistic, immature etc? 
Is wanting a relationship from someone, or information or anything else from someone against stoicism to begin with? Should we not want information?

As an example, this college friend I hadnt been in touch with for a while.  I reached out to him to find out where he takes his car for car repair work. I was desperate at the time, because a few mechanic shops i had tried were obvious scams. So i was getting in touch with people, asking them where they take their cars for work.
This guy didnt answer my text, and i forgot about it but then followed up maybe a month or 6 weeks later thinking maybe he was busy or forgot etc.

Still no answer, so maybe a few days later, I sent him whatsapp voicemails of my good crazy friend pretending to eat girls shit and sniff farts.  I think I also made insulting comments about his wifes small boobs. 
He read my messages and blocked me the same day. I felt satisfied with the outcome, I felt that since he wasnt going to help me with my questions anyway, We aren’t really friends, and I might as well say whatever I want to him.  

If I didn’t do this, and just left things as is and ignored him, if I ran into him in person, he would have acted all friendly, formal, and fake. I’m not into maintaining a fake relationship. Clearly we aren’t friends, so I see no need to attempt to maintain a fake relationship where he ignored my question but then acts formal in person.  Of course you also have to consider if you work in the same industry, have a lot of mutual friends and may cross paths again. In some cases you can’t really afford to do this and basically have to move on for your own good. But in some cases you can do it, if you’re sure you won’t need the person, and it’s more satisfying than just letting them ignore you.",Stoicism,1657980310.0,t3_w0hg1z,0.47,0

Stoicism and capitalist employment: is it a case of slavery and how to respond to it virtuosly?,"Greetings to everyone!

Several open questions to you fellow students of stoicism:

1) is not modern day precarious work (subsitence-level employment when you are not an ""enterpreneur"" or self-employed) basically akin to voluntary or debt-slavery of Antiquity in principle?
2) would not it be dispreffered and/or wrong to enslave ourselves and others even if you would posses the means to do so (private ownership of capital in the first place)?
3) should we not forget that the notion of freedom (libertas/eleuteria) in Antiquity implied not being employed and/or owned by other persons which means at least material subsitence-level freedom from debt and possession of means to survive materially?
4) should we not consider the stoic self-mastery and sagehood as necessary also economically cooperative and non-exploitational way of life regardless of historical context (whether Antiquity or capitalist present)?

Marcus Aurelius teaches to not complain; I kinda disagree.,"The quote goes ""Don't be overhead complaining... not even to yourself"" -Marcus Aurelius, 8.9.  

Complaining is all about emotional expression. when an emotion is dominating your mind it becomes easy to become hopeless, and feel like you cannot fix the problem. When you vent out this emotion (complaining is an easy way to do that), it allows your brain to operate clearly and it removes that burden from your mind. So id wager it's more beneficial to complain in moderation than to not most of the time. Also, from my experience it's a great ice breaker, an easy way to relate to other people, and often doesn't come off as annoying.

What becomes of stoicism if it turns out that free will doesn't exist?,"More and more major neuroscientists, behavioral scientists, physicists, and philosophers are coming out in agreement that free will simply *cannot* exist, and (here I'm loosely paraphrasing Sabine Hossenfelder) if you think it does exist, then you simply don't understand science.

The crux is: Does stoicism become obsolete if it is proven that free will doesn't exist?

My attempt to respond to Biden's student loan forgiveness like a stoic,"This isn't about politics.

I found myself slightly annoyed that I don't qualify for student loan forgiveness which was just announced in the U.S.

I make just a little bit too much to qualify, but I still have student loans to pay off.

Now, I made good decisions about my education. I didn't go to an expensive school and I chose a degree that would get me a decent paying job, rather than follow my passion which would have likely ended in poverty.

Meanwhile, some theatre/creative arts major drop out who racked up a ton of debt at an expensive school, or some English major who can't get a job is getting bailed out of his poor life choices (nothing against the arts, etc...).

My second, more stoic response to this situation is that it is still better to be me than that person getting bailed out, even if it doesn't seem 100% fair.

The best revenge is to not be like them - not that they did anything to me personally (besides take my tax dollars).

While this falls short of compassion, it seems like an effective response to all manner of recipients of relief, government handouts, etc where the bad situations they are in could be attributed, at least partially, to the choices of the individuals themselves.

Rather than blaming them for their faults which we don't control, we can focus on reinforcing the virtues we have that allow us to be better off, and being grateful for them.

From there, we can work towards compassion without judgement and consider all the things that are not in our control that may have made the difference for us.

How to stop wanting to be the prettiest girl in the room,"Ive dealt with this for years, and its so weird but i am not an ugly person. I always get complimented on my looks by strangers almost everyday and ive been told i am the prettiest girl people have ever seen. And dont get me wrong, being the prettiest girl was never my goal; i was aware that i am attractive but i thought being a good and kind person was even more important. And i have had people comment on my personality too, confirming that i am good and kind to people or atleast try to be. So i dont get why deep down i give so much importance to my physical appearance. I often find myself comparing my looks to other beautiful women. Over the years ive tried my best to get rid of this thought, any time this thought arises i try not to pay attention to it cause i just attribute this thought to my human side, its something i cant really change but i dont have to obsess over, and/or i will tell myself that everyone is beautiful and it doesn’t take away from my beauty, and/or not everyone will find me attractive, and thats okay. Even with all this, i still care and i dont want to, i dont want the thought even to arise because i know how trivial it is and i dont want to waste my energy on this.

Breakup Guilt,"Hello,

Six months ago my boyfriend left me. I was very emotional in the relationship, driven by my insecurities. This led him to cheat and then abandon me and cut contact completely. These last months, all I’ve been doing is playing a loop in my head hoping I would’ve done things differently and he’d still be here. I feel like I was abusive and it is haunting me. I learned so much and I’ll never be like that again, but I learned it after losing him. I’m filled with regret and constantly telling myself it was all my fault.

Can anyone offer me some advice?

"Should the mods ban ""seeking stoic advice"" posts?","I joined this sub years ago to learn more about stoic philosophy. These days, it seems like 90% of posts are ""How do I deal with X?"" The OP almost never has a question directly relevant to stoicism, and the answers are typically less than enlightening.

This sub used to be scholarly, but lately it's become a lame self-help message board. I think the mods should ban advice seeking posts that don't at least reference stoicism. ""Seneca said to do X, but I tried it and it didn't work"" would be fine. ""How do I get over my sister being mean to me?"" would not be.

The Stoics need a symbol. What should it be?,"The Stoics need a symbol that immediately identifies them as a way of life. The Christians have the cross, Muslims the crescent, Jews the star of David. Many eastern religions have symbols, such as the yin-yang for Taoism. What should the Stoic symbol be, something that unites and immediately identifies the Stoic community?

I was inspired by Epictetus's line that ""everything has two handles by which it may be borne."" That is, there is always a way to bear something in such a way that it becomes an advantage, or a source of strength and character. As Marcus says, *it is not a burden to suffer this, but good fortune to be able to bear it like a good man*. Could the Stoic symbol be a pot with two handles?

No Lives Matter,"With all the current goings on it got me thinking of the below quote; 

 **""Always reflect that soon you will be no one, and nowhere.""** \- Marcus Aurelius 

In a couple of generations no one will remember your name, I carried out a little experiment and asked people to name their great great grandparents. No one knew their name and they are family only a few generations away. Of course you can look them up in a book but chances are that's all you will be a couple of words in a book with your name. 

Now this might sound negative and nihilistic but for me it has given me a freedom, in a sense that the only thing I have to control is the present moment.

"I hate the fact that some people have won in life by being rich doing what they love. e.g streamers, YTubers, Artists, Athletes etc and the rest of us are just NPCs. here in this world mostly for the purpose of making the rich and famous more rich and famous.","
Ok that last sentence was taking it too far and not really the topic of this post but i sometimes i feel like that.

They are exceptions tho, Doctors, and scientists to me are the only normal professions where i actually regard them higher than any Elite and have no envy and jealousy towards them even tho some of them are rich. Why ? mostly because their job is fulfilling and purposeful their success and money is well deserved, that's why I dont envy them. A society without scientists and doctors would be a terrible sight to see.

But when it comes to the aforementioned vocations, to me a streamer that sits in front of his computer and film themselves and gets  $60M to upto $100M deals its just downright depressing to me. And i hate that instead of being happy for them like most people im just a hater simply because it wasn't me gettig that money. Clearly they have won in life and i didn't. 

What's interesting is that if i was rich i wouldn't be doing much different from what im doing now which is just staying in my house taking care of my brothers kids while he work. However if i were rich i would be able to do what i desired the most in life(right after my familys health) and that is setting up my mom, dad and brother for life. Have them have an easier life by living off my money yet here i am living off my brothers money. Bc im a 29 yo dude with severe mental illness that destroyed my life in my teens. I have severe social anxiety and mild hypochondria. 

But besides SA i have a lot of regrets in my life. I had the opportunity to date two of the hottest girls in school ( 3 if i count one that had one of the best glow up ive ever seen, but by that time i was either out of high school or knees deep in SA, cant remember).but anyway, i was always a timid dude with girls i liked even wayyy before i developed SA.(i was an extrovert) 

i another regret was not taking education/school/English as a second language seriously(it lead me to having very poor communication skills in terms of vocabulary, quick wits, intelligent talks etc. i basically sound like a 8 year old even in my own mother language; Spanish. For reference I have been living in the states since i was 10 and i can barely have short conversation without sounding like i just started learning English a few months ago.( Ive been trying to read more books-- last two i read was The Stand and Perfume: the story of a murderer--to improve that but that don't really help me speak, besides all my vocab goes out the window when im in the spot. SA deff has an impact on that.) 
And btw im 100 sure i have no learning disability  or low iq. if there's one thing i remember about my dad in my childhood was him being proud of me for my cleverness/savyness when I was really young.

Let me throw this out there too, I started balding pretty young at around 16yo. that did a number on my insecurities too but what started my SA was my insecurities about my feet( they are or at least were back then a bit big but most fat, I got very insecure about my feet and to make long story short that developed into SA.

 Anyways i dont want to make this longer than it has to. This is mostly me trying to do something to feel a little better at the moment ( the terminology espcapes me). It's 3am and its been 2 hours since i got to our new place which took 5 hours to get here. Me and my sister in laws brother did the whole moving(brother was working at his new job in the hospital) we got up at 4am and got here at 1230am. All i could think was man i wish i was rich so my life would be easier even tho i know i have it way better than a shit ton of ppl especially those kids dying of painful cancer as we speak. I never reach out like this but today broke me.

Superiority question,"When you look around in the world, and on the Internet, social media, personal experiences etc you see that the vast majority of people don’t really have morals.  Countless examples of people looting, stealing, destroying, killing, raping.   Countless examples of people being greedy, not donating money. Examples of people physically attacking someone because of something that was verbally said. I think most people, if they could attain a billion dollars in exchange for killing a billion people, most people would probably take that offer and live that life of luxury and have no regrets.

So taking all that into account and being a stoic, having superior morals etc, how can you help but not feel superior to the average person? Just being unwilling to steal or rape or attack someone, even if you have an opportunity to do it, essentially makes you superior to probably 90%+ of the human population currently. The value of a person can only be determined by their character, morals, actions etc. it can’t be based on looks, wealth, fame, or anything superficial.

Stoicism debunks Christian view afterlife.,"Although the followings are my own findings, they are possible not without similarities with other's.

My Background: I was raised in a very religious, christian family (my grandfather was an orthodox priest), and I was in a religious high school. Last year I found Stoicism, via /r/noFap/, via CBT. Last autumn I ""deconversed"". I've always had certain problems with the christian worldview, but they were not so serious. I've always been a heretic... But last October I turned around. 

So.

Christian afterlife has two (three) possibilities. 
Hell, (Purgatory), Heaven. Let's focus on Hell.

Hell means ""unhappiness"" while heaven means Happiness. 
The mainstream meaning of Hell is ""Eternal life withouth the presence of God"" (*or the old-school meaning is eternal torture* ...). 
So I am a prokopton, I will die without accepting Jesus as my savior/messiah/salvation. So, I will get an eternal punishment for my earthly, temporal sins. (*This is not justice if you ask me btw...*). But I have my consciousness, or how could I experience the pain/suffering without it?  So, According to Stoic teaching, One can attain happiness in **any** circumstances. Assume, I am lying in the torture chamber, but I have the possibility to choose my ""thoughts, and judgments"", cause I will have my consciousness. In the same time I would have an infinite time to attain tranquility even during torture.

Other possibility is that God/Evil will prevent me to choose my own thoughts. But in that case, Who or What I would be? Who would experience the pain? I would be in that case as an automaton, animal or green-vegetable....

*In my worldview, I am not my thoughts: I am the one who can choose what to think, or what kind of judgement to make in any case.*

So I think it is not reasonable to suspend my own (*certainly imperfect*) sense of reason/justice/philanthropy/wisdom in this earthly life to favor some transcendent Entity. 

What do you think about that? I've read so many times that Christianity is very compatible with stoicism, but I think, they are very far from each other. (Except in the meaning of some practical morality.)

Stoicism says: ""You can be happy on your own, you can have a good meaningful life without any outer help, or gifts, in any circumstances.""

Christianity says: ""Only by my help, with my Gift/Sacrifice can you attain (eternal) Happiness. Every one else is pure evil."" ",Stoicism,1453553171.0,t3_42apv6,0.54,2

During this time I also fell in love for the first time in my life. 

The type of love where I don't even think of the other person sexually and want to get into a relationship to hold hands and talk about TV shows.  

Lately, by the virtue of stoic reflection I've come to realize holding off on telling her for the reason of ""getting better to impress her"" is a foolish one, and so I made up my mind to ask her out by the end of the year. 

Right now, I've got one try of that under my belt. 

It happened 2 days ago, and with as much preparation as I had, nearly a week of stoic reflection, recounting, and writing I still didn't manage to ask her out.

Now, the problem is she's sexually active with another guy, so I'm almost sure to get rejected.

Should I follow the virtue of honesty and tell her how I feel, as I've been depriving her of this fact, and try asking her out, or should I just accept the fact that she is in a ""relationship"" and move on with my life?

This feels like an opportunity to express great virtue, courage for getting the confidence necessary, justice for the honesty required, and moderation in keeping the whole thing grounded and not too over the top, but is it worth it over just accepting that getting into a relationship with her is out of my control and continuing my life?

Should running be part of Stoicism?,"For me the core tenet of Stoicism is to live according to nature i.e. as nature has intended humans to be and more specifically what separates us from other things in nature. The Stoics say that what separates us from other things in nature is our reason and the ability to use it, so use reason in everything.

In Christopher McDougall's famous book, 'Born to Run' he positions that humans evolved to run and run more efficiently for longer distances than any other animal, and that that is what separates us from other things in nature. Other anthropologists have also said this and to be more precise that we not only evolved to run, but that we evolved as we did because we ran.

So if running (particularly long-distance running), is in our nature and the Stoics advise us to live in accordance with nature, then should we include the practise of running in Stoicism?

There may be other things that separate us from other things apart from running and reason, that I can't think of, and should they be included in good Stoic practises?",Stoicism,1663022340.0,t3_xcqgdv,0.44,0
Stoicism vs Black Lives Matter,"It's incontrovertibly true that black lives matter, but a decentralized political organization calling itself ""Black Lives Matter"" has hijacked that phrase and I can't see how it's virtuous.

Stoics repeatedly counsel people to turn away from the passions and emotions which dictate their actions, but Black Lives Matter encourages the opposite, inculcating a deep anger and resentment towards police and government. The Stoics said that such approaches were ""against nature."" What they meant was that the emotions would cloud one's judgement, obscure the truth, and likely result in self-defeating actions.

Yes it's insanely controversial right now, but Stoics should stand up for what's right no matter the cost. Working class black neighborhoods have a high crime rate. Defunding police and alienating police from the neighborhoods they are supposed to protect is not going to help working class blacks; it's going to increase crime and keep those neighborhoods in poverty for years to come. That's an obvious outcome which reinforces the Stoic reliance on Reason over emotion.

Using Reason and ignoring emotion, we might be able to see that the most successful emancipation and ciivil rights movements of the previous century were led by Gandhi and MLK. If there is really something at stake here, nonviolence and reconciliation will obviously be far more effective at generating a desired outcome than looting and alienation. If we really want police brutality against blacks to end, let's have block parties where the police are invited, where they get to hang out with their fellow citizens they are assigned to protect.

Accomplished Stoics shouldn't get riled up in the midst of any of this. They should be a calm voice of reason and guide the different parties towards reconciliation. To the extent that one party or the other can't accept reconciliation, they're too emotional to create a beneficial outcome, and can be safely ignored.",Stoicism,1602466066.0,t3_j9hpxz,0.48,0

Stoicism and the political spectrum?,"Is it my impression or most people who admire the stoic philosophy tend to be on the right side of the political spectrum?  
The whole ""sticks and stones may break my bones but words cant hurt me"" and the ""something can only offend you if you allow it"" philosophy seem to go against the modern leftist ideology (I am speaking about the ideology that dominates modern academia).  
Also, self reliance (a stoic quality) has always been a remarkable trait of the right, whereas most leftists seem to be very fond of wanting the goverment (and other external agents) to solve their problems for them (police, lawyers, court of law, politicians...).

From the article: ""You obviously have a lot of self-confidence. How do you use that in a business deal?
I believe in positive thinking, but I also believe in the power of negative thinking. You should prepare for the worst. If I'm doing a deal, I want to know how bad it's going to be if everything doesn't work rather than how good it's going to be.

I wouldn't want to discuss his merits or shortcomings or celebrity, but could you see him as a person who had fully adopted that philosophy?  On a MSNBC documentary and in other places, I've heard him talk about a belief in the power of positive thinking.

Are there any Neurodivergent Stoics?,"Hi

I was really wondering how do individuals with maybe ADHD or Maladaptive daydreaming or OCD approach the stoic methods? 

To be honest, stoic techniques have helped me a lot with dealing with negative thoughts and taking responsibility. But I struggle a lot with discipline although I have been successful with having some structure. But usually my mind is a battle ground, i fall back on reveries or my coping mechanisms that I've known for long. Also when i challenge my mind too much with pushing discipline excessively I tend to have severe depressive or anxiety related episodes.

I would love to hear from Neurodivergent individuals who have successfully used stoic methods.

sex and stoicism,"i feel so much jealousy hearing about people 's sexual experiences ,  it feels like they are discovering things and i am not ,about themselves.this frustration was worse when someone i liked kissed someone else .
for context i have 0 experiences,never even had a kiss. had some people ask me out ,but never accepted.
i read somewhere that stoicism advices against sleeping around.and saving everything for marriage,and even my religion states the same thing .and that s what i plan to do.
but i can't help but question if i am making wrong choices here. ifeel so much jealousy seeing people my age partying and having fun while i feel like a recluse (nothing new).
i do believe that it makes it more intimate if you share your first everything with the person you are gonna marry.
I think it s not fair to them to think about an ex you fucked in the past while you are in a marriage. i think it devalues what a marriage is ,and what love is .it s about the notion of:you are the only person i love ,and  it  turns it into""i love you ,but you are just one of the 100 of experiences i have had with people,so nothing special here"".
 i just think what makes life valuable to a  person is how they think of things. and if you don t value things like human connection,sex,kids  ,then what is left? 
plus i think it will be a waste of time and ot will distract me from important things .
i have alll th arguments to back this up (for my brain) but i still feel jealous.

Taking from this sub- small rant.,"I've been reading the last month's worth of posts here and what I have gathered in this community is that we have a lot of self help users asking for advice and a lot of arm chair psychologists more than willing to assist with life advice. (Probably attributed to Ryan Holiday and the self help gurus)

I wish this sub was more of people reading about Stoicism and offering what they learned and shared. 

For example I stumbled upon my studies that the british born philosopher Alan Watts died as an alcoholic in California. I got roped into watching some of YT's animation's over his lectures and they are pretty trippy but I'm going to avoid them going forward. 

My favorite book is Man's Search for Meaning by Victor Frankl and he proposed that a man that is addicted didn't know his life's purpose- and maybe that was why Alan was asking so many good questions- but we shouldn't be going to this man for life advice I believe. 

Searching for life advice or meaning on YT is a dangerous game to begin with anyways- but I'm gathering knowledge. 

Anyways- I ask of you to ask yourself- Would Marcus be asking his peers for this advice or would he be journaling about it? Hire a Therapist and get out of here with that weak shit. I'm sick of seeing that shit water down this sub.",Stoicism,1669203500.0,t3_z2mw02,0.48,0

/r/Stoicism on /r/TheRedPill?,"**TL;DR**: [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/28dxl5/being_controlling_is_for_losers/) has made me wonder whether /r/TheRedPill is Stoic-inclined. What do you think?

*as much as i hate to bring back a ""what would the Stoics think about ice cream"" thread ...*

Long version: In the comments on this sub, I've seen one or two semi-favorable references to /r/TheRedPill. Nothing frequent, but still enough to confuse me, since TRP is notoriously horrible. It gets dissed on SRS and 2XChromosomes all the time. I never really investigated this cognitive dissonance.

That changed last night, when I stumbled across /r/RedPillWomen via /r/DarkEnlightenment. Like, what? Why would almost 10k females be involved in a pickup art community? And then I started reading the top posts on that sub and /r/TheRedPill, which led me to a few very very interesting posts, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/25q7ld/the_red_pill_is_prowoman/) and (more importantly) [this one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/28dxl5/being_controlling_is_for_losers/)

>Many detractors of The Red Pill find the men who subscribe to this body of information to be “controlling.” Nothing could be farther from the truth. The Red Pill promotes something that’s not immediately obvious at first: the complete abdication of any attempt to control anything, except for the one thing you can actually control. Yourself.

Needless to say, I'm internally conflicted. Now I've done my research, TRP doesn't seem that bad to me. Frankly, it seems a lot like a Stoic approach to modern courting and relationships, bundled with some masculine perspective (which, frankly, I consider [much-needed](http://abcnews.go.com/2020/Entertainment/story?id=1526982) in [today's society](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/01/untitled/)). But if that's all it is, then why does it have such a bad rep? I just want to understand.

Under my many past accounts, I've learned to trust the /r/Stoicism community, so now I turn to you once more. Do *you* perceive the Red Pill as a particularly Stoic philosophy? Why? Or why not?

ETA: Thanks for all the responses! There's lots to read and think about! Thanks especially for people who provided well-sourced links. But I've noticed a lot of petty arguing and name calling. Guys, this isn't the place for anger. You're actively detracting from discussion; three separate people have private messaged me their input because they were afraid they'd get lynched in the comments here. The question was simple; let's not get all heated.

ETA2: Yeah, there's a lot of vote manipulation going on here. Well, I guess /r/Stoicism isn't always perfect. That's okay; the admins invented ""sort by controversial"" for a reason, right? :)",Stoicism,1425093833.0,t3_2xfedk,0.62,36
We modern practitioners now hold on to useless ideas and stupid beliefs just because they were once respected.,"It has to be said 

The point of philosophy is to useful, and purposefully, and applicable. If not, then we spend our time perfecting useless ideas and values. 

All to often on this sub have I seen people holding on to old ideas written by former stoics with the idea that it must hold some value. So much so that they will quickly say “well if you don’t believe that, then maybe stoicism isn’t your thing!” Or “that’s not what the stoics believe!” We are seeing things that are not there. 

Stoicism wants to find the best way to live a good life, a life of virtue, right? We are committed to truth, are we not?

Then what purpose does things like Cosmic Cycles, or world cycles, or anything of the matter that was truthfully a bunch of mumbo jumbo from ancients with ancient ideas. 

Due to the lack of a functional and practical Stoa, the ideas we have kept alive have still continued to atrophy. 

Stoicism was created with the common man in mind. Those that wanted good and practical wisdom to structure their life. It’s time we bring back that sentiment and clean house.

Everything has to be on the table to view with strict scrutiny. Or we will be no wiser than the people we respected so much, even after all this time.

Stoicism can be a replacement for therapy,"Around my house I can fix things like leaky faucets and dead vacuums, but if a problem brings me close to electrical main lines I call an electrician. I'm happy to do it, but I'd never call him over to change a light bulb---it's faster, cheaper, better for me to do it myself. Some people are more handy than me and can build a house, others can't flip a breaker.

So it is with stoicism---and most moral philosophies---and mental health. Problems of the mind are the stuff of life; we all try to fix destructive behavior, figure out life goals, cope with grief, reconcile a traumatic event, and more. Sometimes the problem is small, sometimes it's big. A big problem faced by a young man whose seen little of the world and has no philosophy calls for talking to someone. A small problem faced by a woman steeped in a good philosophy is nothing for her to handle on her own. 

I've had my share of hardship, and stoic ideas often kept my mind right. Its not hard for me to think of a world where I hadn't pored over this philosophy and so found myself needing help.

I would never say that ""stoicism"" is always a replacement to talking with someone, but it can be. It has been.",Stoicism,1701897875.0,t3_18ceo0z,0.42,0

Is Stoicism a good idea?,"Hello friends,

I'm currenty on a binge reading streak on men/women relationships and feminism and now i'm in the middle of  ""How can i get through to you"" by Terry Real. Not gonna lie i think every man should read it but that's not my point but it got me thinking about stoicism. Especially those lines :

*""When i first began looking at gender issues, I believed that violence was a by-product of boyhood socialization. But after listening more closely to men and their families, I have come to believe that violence is boyhood socialization. The way we 'turn boys into men' is through injury. We sever them from theirs mothers, research tells us, far too early. We pull them awway from their own expressiveness, from their feelings, from sensitivity to others. The very phrase ' Be a man' means suck it up and keep going. Disconnection is not fallout from traditional masculinity. Disconnection is masculinity""*

My reflexion is : As men, is stoicism the ""right"" philosophy to follow?  Shouldn't we follow a philosophy that try to reconnect us with our emotions even if the reconnection could be chaotic in the first time?

idk...its blurry in my head but wanted to share it on this sub.

any advice for lost incel,"24M who identifies as incel, I recognize how bad of a mentality incel shit is, but through out my day I always find it to be true which strengthens my belief in it.

when I first found the redpill/incel theories and stuff, I didn't really believe it, but when I tested one or two of their theories and seeing it was true I was more curious and decided to find out how much of what they say is right.

the 1st thing that made me believe in redpill stuff was the idea of ignoring girls to attract them, I thought that contacting a girl everyday asking about her day, showing interest and acting nice to her will make her like me but when I tried the redpill approach by ignoring her for a week, it worked, she became the one to initiate small talks.

I followed more redpill advice, it was like magic, something like a chemistry equation, do X or say Y and girls will react to it in this Z way 100% of the time.

I had many female friends at the time, I integrated myself into their circles and their chats (no person in my life suspects that I'm an incel) and I was shocked by the way they talked about guys, everything redpill/incel guys said about women were true, they are more superficial than men, they HATE and I mean HATE short guys, you have no idea , some girls who had tall handsome boyfriends can't keep their mouths closed, they need to make fun of the short dudes for exisiting , even if he's minding his buisness, not even approaching them.

With time the incel belief became undeniable, like once you see it you cannot unsee it. I can't now communicate with a girl/woman without thinking about the horrible things she thinks of me ( cause I'm 5'7).

And what fuels me is that in public situation they play angels and deny all that, I was convinced that girls are indeed evil by nature.

some part of me knows that hating the other gender aka half the society is ridiculous and super wrong, but I can't help but be reminded by what I heard and saw.

This is what made us the great nation we are.

     ""My fellow POWs and I could work up very intense hatred for the people who tortured us. We cussed them, made up degrading names for them, swore we would get back at them some day.

UPDATE: Apparently this needs more spelling out.

We *cannot* be held responsible for our past choices because they are neither *ours*, nor they are *choices*.  They were determined exclusively by the experiences we happened to end up with. Leaving *no room* for ""free will"", or anything else of our choice.

The ""free will"" is just an illusion, our way to rationalize the deeply irrational feeling of guilt and shame about our past actions. And yes, it means that the very concept of *punishment* is simply WRONG.

I won't be a vegan.,"My teenage daughter and I completed a life experiment this month.  We went full on vegan.  I learned sooo much about veganism, especially about it's ethical and moral  stance.  My first reaction was that this seemed closely related to Stoicisms ideal of our interdependent nature with the world.   I had that beautiful warming of my heart.  But as the month went on, I began noticing in the vegan subreddit, the majority of the shares were meant to shame people into their viewpoint.  In my experience, shaming is a form of causing suffering onto others.  I've also found it one of the least effective methods of changing people's behavior.

I have found my body feeling extremely energized from switching away from dairy.  I wasn't a big meat eater before.  I will most likely order at restaurants as a vegan for simplicity, but won't be calling myself a vegan.

I would also add that I'm not saying I'm vegan, because I don't believe in the philosophy fully and want to honor the designation of those that do.  ",Stoicism,1551379269.0,t3_avujs8,0.52,1

my problems with modern stoicism,"The problem with modern stoicism is that it doesnt lead to changes in your behaviour. Only changes in your thoughts. Even modern day philosophers like Stefan Molyneux from freedomainradio and Tyler Durden from real social dynamics fame give more practical advice. 

Now logically, changes in thoughts should lead to changes in behaviour. If you dont care what people think about you then you interact with them differently. 

Another thing that bothers me is that stoicism is too close to slave morality. Epictetus story about his master twisting his leg until it broke. Why not resist, surely its in your control. Why doesnt he fight not only his master but slavery in general, rather than be a good slave.


I started thinking about this after reading the introduction to ""A guide to the good life"". The author said that back in the ancient days you could clearly see what school of philosophy people belonged to by their actions and even by how they looked.

But its impossible to point out a stoic from a non stoic just by looking at him. Changing your philosophy should lead to changing your life. And it seems that the philosophy stoicism was based on did just that. 

For example there are no cynics in the military. But there are plenty of stoics. And if you can be a philosopher and a thug for hire at the same time then your philosophy isnt worth much. 


Now changing your thoughts has value but it should lead to changes in your action. 

I need practical lifestyle advice. What good is atheism if you still go to church after becoming an atheist. 

This might be a problem just with modern stoicism. The definition of a stoic these days seems to be: ""A man who reads Marcus Aurelius""

I thought stoicism was about virtue. If you dont change your life then how much more virtous can you have become.
The consequence of putting virtue above everything else is that you will get fired from most jobs. Just look at Patrice O'neal. He was a stand up comedian. Couldn't catch a break despite being the funniest man of all time because he valued honesty above everything else. 

Now perhaps the olden stoics did change their lives drastically but modern stoicism is a joke. For example, religion is the antithesis of philosophy. We have christian stoics. Need I say more. 


A further problem: stoicism is used by evil men to justify their actions, ""Just doing my duty"". How vey stoic of you. 

Changing your thoughts can be of great benefit, but only if action follows.

Does anyone else struggle with feelings of sanctimony and an inflated ego with stoicism?,"Stoicism has helped my life massively, and because  of that I feel like it’s starting to inflate my ego. Anytime I find myself stroking my own ego, I try to bring myself back to reality.

I find arrogant/know it all people to be so incredibly cringe and obtuse, but I can’t help but start to feel that way about myself. Stoicism has changed my life in such a dramatic way, that I can’t help but feel like I know a secret to life that everyone else is ignorant to…and my ego insists on telling me I must be such a special snowflake for possessing the knowledge few others have. I find myself impulsively preaching to others about stoicism and I feel gross after the fact(I will gladly talk about it to those who like to talk philosophy, but others don’t care).


The rational part of me knows I’m not special, or better than anyone else…and I’d really like to develop a sense of natural humility to bring myself back to ground level. At times when I am humble, my ego busts in the door of my mind like the Koolaid man saying ""Wow look you are so admirable and special for being humble!!!"".

Are stoics pantheist or theist?,"I recently came across a stone image of Marcus Aurelius about to sacrifice a bull at the the Temple of Jupiter. Do we know why Marcus performed pagan rituals? My first guess is it was out of obligation as the high priest of a pagan empire? What I’m curious about is if he actively believed and practice paganism at the same time he was a stoic? From what I’ve read of the stoic texts it appears that their beliefs were some mixture of pantheism, polytheism, and theism. My brain can’t make sense of this.",Stoicism,1700415337.0,t3_17z2apm,0.47,0
"How would a stoic deal with a next door neighbor's barking dogs that bark randomly and heavily throughout every day, all daylight hours?","How would a stoic deal with a next door neighbor's barking dogs that bark randomly and heavily throughout every day, all daylight hours?  The constant barking is similar to someone honking their car horn every day, off and on throughout the day.

I already tried to communicate with the neighbor 2 times, and he believes it is his right to have the barking dogs in his yard.

After over a year of tolerating this, I finally involved the police because there is city ordinance against heavily barking dogs.  The day after, the neighbor gave me attitude, and he seemed to keep the 2 dogs inside most of the day so it was much quieter, and he seems to be testing the waters to see how much he can ""get away"" with his dogs barking, even after police involvement.  Also he remote-honks his car horn several times throughout the day, and tonight he honked his car horn repeatedly about 7 times (by pushing a button on his key fob for emergency, and he locks his car with the horn honking and remote starts his car with the horn honking.  He's a total noise maker.  Would you repeatedly involve the police?

So....how doe a stoic deal with this both mentally and externally?   Remember, it is a serious compromise to just ""accept it"" and to ""live with it"".

Being humble isn't a quality,"I know that it's out of my control when others ""praise"" me for being humble. I've been partially practicing stoicism for years, but now I have embraced its purpose and made things more clear.

I don't see being humble as a quality. It's only logical and reasonable. When I say to people, ""By the way, don't take what I say to heart and check after everything I say because I am not all knowing."" People find that humble.

It's not humble it's logical. I understand that others see it as a quality, but even when I try to refute it by saying, ""I am just stating a fact,"" it only backfires into more compliments.

I honestly don't know how to respond. Stoicism teaches us that others' opinions about us don't matter, but our ego is a real thing, and I have to squash it every time I receive a compliment. 

I rationalize it in my head and not worry about it, but it's frustrating to deal with because it's extra work on my part. I'd rather take insults instead.

Any advice from my brothers and sisters?

EDIT: I've had a talk with my wife, and she deduced that I have an issue with my ego being inflated. Long ago, I was pretty much an arrogant idiot. She also mentioned that I could view it as ""discomfort"" and deal with it.

MINUS $46.13 BANK ACCOUNT AND NEVER FELT BETTER,"Dear All,

If money is what your seeking, your life will surely be confused. Trust me, I was once a only paper chasing machine. And this state of mind led me to follow a boring pyramid scheme company/ get ez money business/ i don't want to work hard but wants lots of money kind of attitude. And this is what happens within the same year of trying to follow others and figuring out how to make money easily.

 I end up losing money, respect, and worked the hardest in my life doing meaningless things that I believe is going to get me $$ rich. This was a big nono. I would work hard day time and drink and party night time with friends and rinse and repeat. It was cruel. I didn't enjoy the moment at my job, I didn't enjoy the moment with my friends. It was like being in hell doing things I don't like and then at night trying to escape hell by downing insane amount of alcohol as a competition among friends. Pure collegery. I made that up as a drunkie college student. Obviously no time is every wasted. Some are still my close friends today. 

This is why I hope this letter can help change many peoples state of mind and thinking and help get my comrades to where they belong, Nirvana in this Earth. When I say this, I don't mean some angelic person that preaches love to everyone and is oblivious of malicious things. No, we know this earth is heaven and hell at the same time. What I mean is, you should be happy being alive, waking up, seeing the colors, feeling the fresh breeze, feeling good and have a greater sense of control and belonging with this earth. Which everyone already is. 

 Lets start with questions. Why were you created? What is your purpose? When someone asked the latter question, I would say I don't know what is my purpose. Then let me ask you another question. What is the purpose of human being?  
Is it not to help the human race? Is it not to help and love each other. Does it not benefit all human beings from one human discovery. Are we infact indebted to one another without laws guiding us and just our reasons?   
Don't we need each other? Aren't we all categorically the same? These are all questions I have answered and pondered throughout my young adult to adult life. 

So few years ago,  i believed what many of my comrades that I went to school with believed, which was- go to college, get a degree, get a good job, and then your set for life. Once I have enough $$ saved, I was like I am going to start a business because I will have the knowledge and skills. That was my inside voice telling me, everything is going to be allright as long as i get my degree. That was indeed going to be false, because there is much more in life than degree/ than company/ than, dare I say, money.  If you think false, you are surely mistaken. And you will find that out eventually. Because your mom is free and I don't mean it in a nasty bullying you online kind of way I mean your mom cost nothing and yet she is everything for you. 

These all sounds like a big mumbo jumbo positive things that mainstream guru says. 

But pay attention, those gurus aren't lying. There is truth to being positive. Recently, I would say couple months ago, my feelings of change came first with curiosity of positive people and gurus. What is the point of that feeling? Is so gay, i thought. Why be ignorant? Why be happy? Don't you see who is the president and what is happening around the world?! But I decided to try it anyway, lets be positive in everything for few days. What happened to my mood and energy blew my mind. In being positive, I discovered extra bit of patience, extra bit of hardwork, and lots and lots of good energy. While my fellow comrades were down in their dumps, their bodies slouched and head low, my chest was up I had a laughter/smirk on my face and felt that I had a greater purpose to my life. Then that is why I avoid all negative shits today and consume only positive things. 

Now let me go back to the amount of dollars up there. That is my bank account today. Am I depressed? Am I sad? That I can't even afford a piece of tootsie roll? hahah

No, I am not. I am actually quite content, happy and grateful today. I Am grateful for my mom, my view of this world I live, and the coffee on my desk. I know that today is minus 46 dollars tommorow will be something else I guarantee it.   
The point is, $$ doesn't really make me feel anything. Its there for exchanges of service and goods. Although, I probably need to get better at my spendings considering I can pay all my necessities expense in 1 weeks pay. I realize that things are temporary. In this case this is only for today but tomorrow my bank account will have enough to do as I please. 

Now what do i please, I please to serve others. I got this from Daniel H. PInk ""Adventures of Johnny Bunko"" relatively a short read but packs a valuable lesson for all young adults and adults, for everyone actually. We are here to serve others. 

This desire to serve others and actually help is what gets my engine going. That is why from now on, nothing is impossible, everything is within my grasp. I am happy. I am healthy. I don't have a need to desire ridiculous amount of $$. I can be happy doing things I like and being a better person and having that desire to help others without any incentive. Before I end this, I would like my reader to know that when you change your mind and your current self, all things break lose. For me changing to being positive and non confrontational person caused many related occurrences to happen in my life which could have caused me to be quite the opposite. I would be tested like i just entered another invisible barrier that wasn't there before now approaches to me to go through me or push me back. I describe it as Murphys law. 

Anyways, I hope all you broke comrades today can take delight that all is well, and what we worry the most is really our imaginations of those incidents that can have thousands of diff. scenarios. 

Thank you.

My girlfriend dumped me for the 4th time,"Long story short. I'm M(22) and's been with this girl F(22) for almost two years. technically, we are not in a relationship since we decided not to label it. we both have strong commitment issues which got us together (irony).  Yet, we talk every day, share our lives and live just like in a relationship yet not labeled. The thing I like about her is she never seeks male attention, dresses provocatively, or parties a lot. She occasionally drinks and maintains strong boundaries with her guy friends which actually has helped us to get over half the drama in our situations since we are long distancing. 

She has this issue of cutting things off when she feels very hurt and overwhelmed. The past few times when she called off what we are into, I convinced her (She very well wanted me to try harder because according to her, if a guy needs a girl, he must be ready to move mountains for her) so I did everything in my power to work things out. But I'm not gonna blame her, poor thing, she has strong attachment issues and the acceptance of her being attached to me took a long time for her. The funny part is, even it's the same shit for me. I had to mentally accept the fact that I'm attached to her and make myself feel okay with it because I hate being attached to anyone except for my family. but this girl changed everything for me. I've been in past relationships where it had to end cuz I wasn't emotionally invested because I don't attach myself. But this was like karma to me, she wanted to end things because of attachment fear.

the reason she gives for ending things with me this time is, I mean every time is, she is in a dark place, she is mentally not in a good place. She ain't lying cuz she has a peculiar character where she deliberately makes her feel sad. She doesn't really take care of herself, she has a bad diet, and bad sleep and takes zero measures to change but whines that she has bad health. She has no purpose yet the person holds strong values. Her only purpose to live is for her father who is diagnosed with Parkinson's. sometimes she says she'd end her life right after her dad's last breath. She is extremely attractive and gets a hell of a lot of attention yet she is the most insecure I've ever seen. I like her cuz she's funny, I'm attracted to her, my day lights up when I talk to her and she takes massive efforts for me (she travels 8-9hrs just to come to see me) yet deep down, I'd sometimes have trouble with the too much attachment. 

Now I guess I've given a small gist of our mindset. So she called me last night and said she wants to call it off. She cries that she tried, she tried all these times to be okay with what we have but she says her negativity is a slow poison and I'm affected by it. (actually to some extent, yes but I like her) She says she's ending things for me cuz her mental state will ruin everything that we have and my peace. She wanted us to end in good terms, when we look back she wants me to be happy but I don't want to give that to her cuz I want a win so I fought and called it quits. Additional information: Everytime she wanted to end things when we fought for some issue, her way of solving the issue is to end things.

I didn't take it well this time. I said some hurtful things and ended which perplexed her cuz she kinda expected me to try a bit maybe? IDK what to do. I'm a stoic, I don't seek pleasure and I've been reading stoic literature for a while now. A part of me wants me to take this as an opportunity to improve myself but all I do is see this as a reason to waste my life, smoke cigs, get drunk and jerk off. and another part of me wants to work things with her, I cannot leave her during this tough times, cuz I know very well I will not find a girl like her but I don't know, I feel she could drag me down but I love her.

Do you think Stoicism is compatible with weightlifting?,"I almost don't want to link them together because Stoic philosophy tends to focus on how to deal with people more than building muscle, but some major Stoic concepts seem to me to be very in line with weightlifting success. Just an example, think of Diogenes. He himself was a Cynic, but the ancient Stoics did admire him. The dude was known to embrace frozen statues in winter. So pain tolerance... Very useful in weightlifting.

Suicide is immoral,">Since I've never intentionally harmed another, what right have I to injure myself?

>Not only is suicide a sin, it is *the* sin. It is the ultimate and absolute evil, the refusal to take an interest in existence; the refusal to take the oath of loyalty to life. The man who kills a man, kills a man. The man who kills himself, kills all men; as far as he is concerned he wipes out the world.

How do you reconcile Stoicism with toxic masculinity?,"If this sounds like a stupid or antagonistic question, I encourage you not to brush it aside. I think it’s actually one of the more challenging considerations when practicing Stoicism.

I’ve been getting therapy ads showing weathered old men saying “don’t show emotion,” “keep it bottled up,” “man up,” etc. While I know that this isn’t actual Stoicism, I do think the practice of Stoic virtues can be mistaken for this detached invulnerability. Not just from the outside but from within. 

For a healthy example of stoicism: a friend who is new to construction has an old supervisor who’s been giving him a hard time. My advice would be to show no sign of grievance and not take it personally, to consider that this bitter dinosaur is that way because he’s lived a shitty life and is projecting (and that the reward for not engaging is that you get to be the happy young man and he has to keep being the rusty old jerk). Or maybe I could frame it like “you can’t control the old man’s behavior, but you can still find value in the work that you are doing,” or “you can line up another job so the boss’s rants seem silly and pointless to you.” My point is, I don’t think it’s hard to find a stoic rationale to resolve that kind of issue. But this can become your default reaction for dealing with everything, and at a certain point, how is that different from “don’t show emotion,” “hero it bottled up,” “man up.”

I ask because in my life there have been times when I feel like the Stoic answer allowed me to shoulder more than I could bear, but then became it’s own cop out when I should have been more vocal in seeking help, or allowed my emotions to guide more of my behaviors. That the cumulative effect of letting things roll off me was something similar to toxic masculinity, at least as it regards trying to be stronger instead of softer or more vulnerable or emotionally receptive.

It can be exceedingly difficult to identify when is the time to share how you really feel, or let passion guide your actions. 

So how does a Stoic avoid the toxic trait of becoming an emotionally detached strong man type of guy?

Edit: I’m not interested in perspectives of anyone who denies that toxic masculinity is a thing. If you can’t identify toxic masculinity in the world around you, then you aren’t qualified to determine if there can be overlap between Stoicism and TM.",Stoicism,1694587179.0,t3_16hfnc1,0.4,0

Transcript of Stoic Meditation #394, on abstaining from animal slaughter and consumption, and other useless things. 

Seneca:

“For what virtue lies in despising useless things? The time to admire your own conduct is when you have come to despise the necessities. You are doing no great thing if you can live without royal pomp, if you feel no craving for boars which weigh a thousand pounds, or for flamingo tongues, or for the other absurdities of a luxury that already wearies of game cooked whole, and chooses different bits from separate animals”

Massimo Pigliucci:

“Most of us have trouble detaching ourselves from what Seneca correctly labels “useless things” — luxuries of all sorts such as pomp, royal or otherwise, cravings for exotic food that cost much to obtain and cause environmental damage and animal suffering and so on… 

And yet, he’s right, doing without thay sort of thing i’ll be particularly onerous. It is but a small step on the path to virtue. 

Have you taken it it yet?”


Seneca continues:

“I shall admire you only when you have learned to scorn even the common sort of bread, when you have made yourself believe that grass grows for the needs of men as well as of cattle, when you have found out that food from the treetop can fill the belly – into which we cram things of value as if it could keep what it has received. We should satisfy our stomachs without being over-nice. How does it matter what the stomach receives, since it must lose whatever it has received?”

Pragmatic approach to reduce any negative impact a president might have on your life [X-post from /r/Pragmatism/],"What pragmatic strategies/tactics do you use to reduce any negative impact a president might have on your life (business and/or personal)?  

UPDATE:  

Findings in my quest so far:  

1 - Stoics to the rescue: be calm, focus on what you can control (not what you cannot), accept reality but don't be passive , be who you want to be (by acting accordingly), act in the now  

2 - what actions to take? take more control of your destiny (so it does not matter who becomes a president and what he/she does)  

3 - taking control of your destiny in unstable political climate. by empowering your personal flexibility, stamina and ultimately freedom (become as independent of any system as possible)

Misconceptions of Meditation,"I want to correct a creeping misconception I've seen in this subreddit lately:

**Stoicism is *not* about ""meditation"".  Stoicism is about *living* in accord with nature and realizing the truth of what is within your control.**

Understanding just how little is actually in one's control is not an invitation to [be passive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fox_and_the_Grapes) or suffer well; it is a challenge to calmly do all that you can.  This is what makes Stoicism challenging and potentially rewarding.

The only reason the modern idea of meditation seems to be associated with Stoicism is the title of Marcus Aurelius' Stoic masterwork.  There are several major problems with putting any weight in this title:

*  The title almost certainly wasn't his, since scholars believe Marcus never intended publication.  You can probably thank a Byzantine Christian monk for that.
*  The original title in Greek is 'Τὰ εἰς ἑαυτόν' (addressed to himself), with 'Meditations' coming much later as a loose English translation via Latin.
*  ""Meditatio"" - the Latin source of the word ""meditation"" only means ""to reflect or consider"" - nothing philosophical or spiritual is implied.
*  Connotations of the word ""Meditation"" have drifted a lot over the centuries - most notably after the introduction of Eastern philosophy and ""New Age"" thinking to the West.

Aurelius is thoughtful, but most of his entries read like brusk admonitions to do one's duty and get back to reality (see [Pierre Hadot's excellent 'Inner Citadel'](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Inner-Citadel-Meditations-Aurelius/dp/0674007077) for more on the purpose of this).  His contemporaries and modern historians paint a picture of the Emperor as a vigorous man actively engaged with the business of government, justice, and war.  *This* is what philosophy meant to the Stoics; it is a tradition of lived philosophy.

Put another way, if you are in a quiet room room alone with your thoughts (keeping posture and monitoring your breathing, etc.), know that your path - while totally legitimate - has nothing to do with the Marcus' Stoicism.  I wish you well and I recommend the good people at /r/zen or /r/ZenHabits.

Marcus Aurelius - The greatest Machiavellian !,"I have a theory that Marcus Aurelius, the Roman Emperor from 161 to 180 AD, was the greatest Machiavellian of all time. I argue that his ""Meditations,"" a collection of personal reflections and philosophical musings, were written with the knowledge that they would be read by others after his death. As a result, he only wrote positive things, ensuring a good reputation for himself for eternity. However, there are many criticisms of his reign. For example, his adoption of his son Commodus as his successor has been criticized as Commodus was not a capable leader and his reign marked a decline in the Roman Empire's stability and power. This decision also suggests that he wanted to keep power in his own bloodline. These criticisms challenge the idealized portrait of Marcus Aurelius as a philosopher-king and suggest that he was not the man he is often portrayed as.",Stoicism,1682863336.0,t3_133sqx0,0.48,0

How can I apply Stoicism to my gender identity issue.,"For context, I am 23, male.

There are others aspect regarding why I have so many doubts and confusing experienced with my ifentity but thats not what Im asking here, I know this is not the place. What im asking is what should I do with this knowledge? I had this thought, that maybe through stoicism I could re-evaluate my feelings or challenge them. For example maybe I can accept what is “real” and that is that I am a man, and just a man, and I can just follow what is expected for me and not challenge the gender norm. I had this thought because of this phrase I heard from Marcus I believe the other day. It was something amongst the line of “you are what you think, what you see, and what you identify as.” I know its poorly worded and I cant recall exactly what It meant. But I understood that maybe throughout my lifes experiences I have led myself to believe that I am transgender, and if thats an opinion then maybe I can change it. But theres also a part of me that wants to instead of neglecting or changing a part of me wants to accept it, once again poorly quoting Marcus, he said something about being true to oneself, that only being authentic can you do your best at life. Im tired of looping around this issue with my life, and I want to tackle it the best way but I know that there are things in the way and that I cant resolve them unless I start practicing being courageous, and challenging myself and ket go of the fears I have of being judged, critized, insulted, I feel I wear a mask, I cant express my honest opinions or be myself in public because I always wanted to be perfect, but I became a shell of who I am and no longer want to keep being this person.

How can the principles of stoicism help when you’ve been ‘friendzoned’ by someone you like?,"Hi all. I am a relatively new student of stoic philosophy, although I have always admired it as it seemed consistent with my own ideas and beliefs. I have been reading a lot of original work’s recent but am looking for some help in sorting through the ideas in this situation because I feel confused and conflicted by many things. The title is pretty straightforward and would probably be enough, but here’s some more context for anyone with time and attention to spare. 

At the end of last semester, I started talking to a girl from one of my classes who was an exchange student who would be going home at the end of the semester so I didn’t think anything would come of it. We met to hang out a few times before she left, and although it was really fun and she was a really cool person, nothing else happened romantically and I thought her leaving would be the end. 
But after she went home, she continued contacting me and we grew really close with daily texting and weekly FaceTime calls. After about 3 months I asked her what was going on, whether we were just friends or something more, because I had started developing stronger feelings. I was disappointed to hear her say she only saw me as a friend, that she hadn’t told me about another guy she was seeing when we started talking, and that she recognized her behavior the last few months had been misleading. But she reiterated how strongly she cared for me and didn’t want to lose me as a friend. 
I told her I needed some space and after a week of no contact she texted asking how I was. Since then we have been talking fairly regularly. In fact, she is almost more talkative than she was before. But there are times we go a day or two without talking, and it actually feels okay now. But although I accept her lack of romantic interest, I can’t say I am completely over her yet, and it’s hard for me not to consider the future with her despite her lack of interest and the distance. And every time there is a lull in communication she finds something to keep it going. My issue is I fear that by continuing to be friends, I am making this harder on myself and possibly being unfair to her. 

I am confused by how I can apply some of the teachings of stoicism to my situation. On one hand I feel I should accept what fate has brought me, which is a good person who apparently really wants to be my friend, and stop focusing on the past and future. But I am trying to be wise and just to myself and her. I don’t want to be in a situation where I am constantly in pain or where I cannot be a true friend to her. I am trying to accept that I can control so little of this, but I still think that how I act now has some bearing on this relationship and my life overall. I would appreciate any advice into what I have done wrong at any point so far or any misconceptions of the philosophy I may carry.

"Once a cheater, always a cheater (?)","I've been in a wonderful and healthy relationship with my girlfriend for over a year now. My parents know her well, but her family sees me only as a close friend because according to her, her parents are strict and forbid her from having a relationship with me until we’re at the right age.

However, a few months into our relationship, she admitted to me that she had developed feelings for me while she was still with her ex-partner. Her explanation was that their relationship had turned toxic, which led her to seek solace in her feelings for me. 

Yes, she acknowledged her mistake and apologized, I couldn't help but feel hurt and conflicted about the situation. It just seemed unjustifiable to me, regardless of the circumstances.

At first, I tried to brush it aside because our relationship was going so well and I was genuinely happy with her. But as time passed, it really started to bother me.

I know people can change, and she seems sincere in her efforts to be a better person, but I can't help but be bothered by the fact that she liked me while she was still in a relationship with someone else. Even though there are no signs of her being unfaithful now, I am scared that history might repeat itself.

She reassures me constantly and seems genuinely happy with our relationship. She makes me the happiest person, and my attachment to her deepens each day. However, that knowledge of her past actions still haunts me, and I can't shake off the fear of ""once a cheater, always a cheater.""

I'm torn and confused about what to do. On one hand, I want to trust her and believe that people can change, but on the other hand, the fear of being hurt remains.

A critique of the dichotomy of control.,"Without a belief in a providential universe, the dichotomy of control rapidly devolves into Hedonism and Nihilism. I'll explain. Typically this practice is used by secular modern people to argue that Stoicism can be practiced without their metaphysical beliefs, but the truth is that the results of practicing the complete system vs only the easy therapeutic sayings are worlds apart.

If you don't believe in any providence or cosmic reason, intelligence, logos, deity, or ordering principle (gasp) then all you're doing to justify the dichotomy of control is to say ""because it feels good"". It's less stressful. Ignoring problems is just comforting. I am not denying it is, because it absolutely is relaxing to not worry. In fact, why not just not care about anything? Nothing makes any sense, the world is random, has no purpose, so just chill out and literally take no concern or higher responsibilities. I'm sounding Epicurean now since they explicitly advised against anything that would burden you in the slightest in order to keep your cool.

Therefore, if you don't believe in anything greater than yourself, there is nothing stopping you from continue the process of not caring into all matters, internal or external. This isn't even extreme, it's how people already live. Nobody is out there in any significant numbers worrying about their honor, integrity, fidelity, sincerity, bravery, humility, and so on and on.

But let's rephrase this recipe into providential terms: Learn to separate what is up to you to govern from what belongs to God to govern and you will do well. You don't get to tell God how to run things, how to create the world, how humans should be, how your husband should be, how your wife should be, how nature should be ordered. Nor how God makes you, for that matter. But Providence did give you a portion of the divine mind in your soul, as a means to be sentient enough to control your judgements and assent. That is wholely yours, and not even God can interfere there, though a suggestion and guidance can be made.

All of this is in line with the religious tone of the writings of Epictetus, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius. The reason they don't go astray, is not because they write it down on a journal every day, but because they have their full trust in the God as described by Zeno of Citium hundreds of years earlier.",Stoicism,1609540573.0,t3_kokrdt,0.55,2

I was excited to hear that Adam Carolla had a guest on his show that was championing Stoicism. It didn't take long for me to raise an eyebrow regarding to this author sincerity.
Ryan Halliday began the interview by replying to Adams question "" What is Stoicism?""

He replied ""Stoicism is a philosophical school that started in Rome........""
This is wrong as most people with a cursory interest in Stoicism would know. He went on to give an underwhelming summary of what this Hellenic philosophy is. I became curious of who this person is so I looked into his past .  He was a protege Of Robert Greene , the author of '48 rules of power' . Count yourself blessed if you don't of this book. It's closer to Machiavelli than anything produced by the Stoics. All about how to obtain externals through whatever means. 

The phenomena is called 'controlled opposition'. Stoicism was the ruling school of thought during Rome's peak . Stoicism spreading presents many problems for those running this world. If this philosophy is adopted correctly...fear of death , imprisonment or social disapproval loose their power . ...

How Stoics approach abortion,"Hello, fellow prokopton.

With yesterday's decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the precedent set by Roe v. Wade, which essentially allows states to ban abortion, I thought it best to allow a day of absorption before posting this. For the American women in this community especially, this can be an incredibly difficult time. So first, I would like to say that r/Stoicism (as it always has) will be a community available to provide advice on your various situations you may face in the coming weeks and months.

Now, that said, I would like to use yesterday's decision as a means to observe two different approaches to ethics, and how they can clash irreconcilably. First, I will briefly define deontological ethics and Stoic ethics.

>**Deontological Ethics:** A form of ethics that sets forth a series of moral norms and absolutes, such that an individual must adhere to them without regard for consequences. These moral absolutes are considered ""right,"" and being ""right"" is considered morally superior to being ""good."" These moral absolutes also override an individual's own personal reason, making circumstantial decisionmaking impossible. In other words, if something is ""wrong"" according to deontological ethics, then a person must *never* do it. This type of ethics is very common in religions, and often approaches humans as inherently flawed creatures that need an external correcting action.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

>**Stoic Ethics:** A form of ethics that does not set any moral absolutes regarding specific actions, but rather posits that an individual's intentionality must be based on reason and virtue--without regard for consequences. For Stoics, the ""good"" of virtue is manifest primarily in *why* an individual makes a decision, and secondarily in *how* an individual decides to respond after making a decision. It places total trust in an individual's personal reason from moment to moment--meaning that an action deemed inappropriate in one circumstance can easily be deemed appropriate in another. This type of ethics hinges on the idea that humans are inherently rational creatures that can make virtuous decisions without an external correcting action.

Okay, with that out of the way, let's dive into the matter at hand, to inform why Stoics and deontologists will typically hold conflicting views surrounding abortion.

In deontological ethics, the matter of abortion is often framed as a moral absolute, either:

* Abortion kills a defenseless human person; killing a defenseless human person is *always* bad;
* Abortion provides a woman autonomy over her own body; rejecting bodily autonomy is *always* bad.

Note, while the second view is held by some, it is irrelevant for discussion and reflection today. The first view is more predominantly held and directly affected the decision made yesterday.

In Stoic ethics, the matter of abortion is considered morally indifferent, which means that either:

* An individual will determine that, under present circumstances, abortion is an appropriate action;
* An individual will determine that, under present circumstances, abortion is an inappropriate action.

Stoics regard those who choose not to employ their own reason, but rather blindly accept the stated moral absolutes of some external authority, as fools. And a Stoic who holds some moral absolutes as a result of their prior exposure to deontological ethics must contend with those and decide whether those moral absolutes matter more than personal intentionality and virtue. This is where the irreconcilable clash comes into play. A person must make a choice: be a Stoic or be a fool. Use reason or adhere to external moral absolutes.

It is worth noting that while the U.S. Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade was described as being because abortion is not a right guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution or its amendments, this is almost certainly a red herring used as thin veneer for their ethical foundations and the ethical foundations of those who installed them. I will not get dragged into the miasma of a pedantic debate over ""rights."" That will veer us away from the matter at hand: how humans approach ethics.

I will close how I began. r/Stoicism will keep its doors open to those who need our advice. Whether they are Stoics themselves who have temporarily been overcome by an emotionally-charged situation, or whether they are non-Stoics who simply like to hear the advice of coolheaded individuals, it matters not. With this issue, as with all others, this community is here to help, just as our ancient Greek predecessors were on the Stoa Poikile of Athens all those centuries ago.",Stoicism,1656157903.0,t3_vkdenr,0.55,3

How do I move on?,"I had a summer fling with a girl and when she left we exchanged instagrams and whatsapp before she left. We kept in touch for 6 weeks and were calling each other once a week.

Lately, she hasn't been responding and yesterday she said she wants to stop talking and it seems that we're on the same page since I don't follow her on Instagram. I'm frustrated that a miscommunication led to such a fallout but I also am frustrated she won't hear me out.

i keep getting screwed over by friends.,"Firstly, saved up a ton of money to go to europe with a friend who after 3 days of being in France he decided he needed to go home.

Now, both of these “friends” I considered to be good friends of mine so it definitely sucked to get screwed over by them especially when I don’t have that many friends.

**“You must no longer feel anger, resentment, envy, or regret,” said Epictetus.** Many stoics, such as Epictetus, seem to completely disown emotions, seeing them as irrational and therefore bad. But human emotions, having developed over millions of years for evolutionary purposes (such as the desire to eat when the body requires energy) are natural, and, as Aurelius points out, *“nothing that is according to nature can be evil.”* The problem with emotions then is not that they exist, it is that they are often not as they should be, they are not *“in accord with reason.”* Living virtuously then is not living emotionlessly but living with the correct emotions. As Aristotle said, “*some describe moral virtue as being a kind of freedom from emotion and disturbance; this is incorrect because the assertion should be qualified: they should have said moral virtue is freedom from those emotions that are not as they should be.”*

If we can discipline ourselves, train ourselves, to have emotions that are aligned with how they rationally should be, then *“emotions are not only blameless, but even praiseworthy!” (St. Augustine).* This will not be an easy task though, for *“anyone can become angry — that is easy. But to be angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, and in the right way — this is not easy.” (Aristotle).* 

So then, next time you feel emotion, do not immediately condemn it, but rather reflect if the emotion is as it should have been.",Stoicism,1672072125.0,t3_zvqpyp,0.54,1

"Should I date this girl??? (Long, sorry)","So I am talking to this girl I met from Tinder. We went on a first date and it was definitely the best first date I've been on. We'd been texting for a couple weeks before, and had to reschedule a couple times so I already had a sense of who she was and she is just really really cool. She's pretty, and I can talk to her about things I can never talk to other girls about, because she is a huge geek and very intelligent and articulate, and she is really sweet and kind of innocent-seeming, and basically I was just very comfortable around her and she basically said the date went really well and she wants to see me again, and she has started texting more since then and interacting with her just makes me happy.

HOWEVER. I'm terrible at relationships. I haven't been in many real longterm relationships. And I am not a very secure person by any means, and relationships really make me very neurotic. I get insecure, and I always think about the other person, and obsess, and while in some ways I feel much more confident, in other ways they really just kill me psychologically. I am already feeling this with this girl. I worry whenever she doesn't text back, and before we went out she kind of went AWOL for a week dealing with a friend who developed feelings for her (and she was on spring break) and it just kind of killed me and I actually started feeling better when I thought she was ghosting me and I was done. But now we have gone out and she has given clear signs that she really seems to like me, which again makes me very happy because she just seems like a really special girl, and I haven't been in a relationship in a while and it's exciting, and we're just really on the same wavelength. 

So I really don't know what to do. It's a no-brainer that I should try to date this girl. But I have attachment issues and I'm so scared of losing the few people I really connect with, especially if it's romantically. I'm scared of messing up. She is nowhere near the type of girl who would ever cheat or hurt me like that or anything, but I still worry about this in all my relationships because I've really been hurt before. I even worry about the fact that at somepoint even if things go really well, it'll end eventually and either I will get hurt, which would really suck and be regrettable, or I will hurt her, which is unacceptable.

I know that was a lot, but I wanted to articulate my feelings so maybe you guys could help give me some guidance from a Stoic point of view. I cannot tell if the ""stoic thing to do"" is to realize that this will inevitably lead to pain in some form, whether she ends up not liking me and ghosts me in a month, or we start dating and breakup in 2 years, and likely the amount of pain in the end will be proportional to the time put in............or does the modern Stoic look at this and say ""proceed virtuously, if you really like this girl, give her your all and enjoy the struggle to come to terms with the impermanence and possibility of getting hurt or losing her eventually""...?????

How can i cure or diminish…this lustful desire. It’s been beating my ass,"It’s Sex basically, you all see posts like this every day i know. My story may be a bit different though. Before i begin i need to clarify that i’m neither a feminist nor a incel..or do i have any hatred towards anyone. I do not feel like i am entitled to a woman’s body. I do not feel entitled to anything in this world including my care i’ve gotten from my parents or even the opportunity to go to a good high school and live in good neighborhood etc etc…

20 y/o male. I live in the Southern part of the US. I work as a new car lot porter at my job at a dealership. Huge car guy, my after work…or free time I’m making artwork. Whether it’s sketching a portrait or building a full 3D car. My day consists of work -> home -> repeat. 
The thing is i’ve just recently been able to drive myself to and from work and now i have a car so i can take myself places. I used to think my lack of having a car was stopping me from getting 🐱. Turns out everyone else was right and it is an internal issue. Who knew. 
 My life seems so purposeless now though. I make artwork but no one gives a fuck. No one cares about a starving artist. People say like post on Social media and i’ve been down that road it makes me hate doing the craft itself. I feel like i have no friends at all. Well i don’t.
 I’m going through the list of things thats really on my mind right now. The main thing is of course Sex. 
 Its been exactly a year since i was in my first/last relationship. Ironically she actually had hmu a few days ago. I was excited of course but she got very flakey and i just stopped giving my attention and energy away. To be honest seeing her message took me through a lot of emotions. It’s one of the reasons i’m trying so hard to find a “rebound” We didn’t talk much when we reconnected. Just some texts about how i finally got my vehicle and my new job. When we were dating i worked retail and couldn’t afford a car. I offered to take her out since i now could do more for her. But she said “no thanks” so she’s probably with someone else or idk. Half of me wishes she never had checked up on me. First heartbreaks are always the worst. I took the high road and said i appreciate her reaching out and checking up on me.
I know this is all over the place but bear with me. There’s definitely some women at my job i look at and seen look back at me. Never say anything though. I don’t know how i should do this. There’s like these weird energies or vibes i feel when i pass certain women. Some good some bad. Some really good. I seem to come up with the smoothest game plan and lines in my head. But when i get the opportunity i freeze up.
Ok I need to also mention i’m on nofap…1 1/2 weeks. I do 50 pushups daily. My GM mentioned that he noticed i was working out. So i don’t know if it’s noticeable to the women or not. I always ask myself what are they thinking about me. 
Before you say dating at a job is bad….i am required to talk to 0 people daily…i’m outside all day (others are in) It’s to the point i’m always questioned if i work there since i don’t where a sales or service uniform. Every other employee does but me. Actually there are other examples but you get my point. 
I know rejection can happen…it’s just the uncertainty how. Also the choosing signals i get i always try to assume its them being nice. Maybe it is.

Need advice on annoying beggars,"Hi all, 

During my daily commute to work, there are always the same gypsy beggars that enter my train to hand out flyers that tell me to give them money. During the first 5 encounters I had no difficulty rejecting them. Now it really starts to annoy me to the point that I want to grab them by their throats and tell them that they have to buy a train ticket, stop bothering people and contribute to society by working a normal job. They know my annoyed face by now and they still have the audacity to try and hand me over their stupid flyer. The fact that I see people next to me give them money makes it even more frustrating because I know they live in a RV camp outside of the city with no poor living standards at all. These healthy men should work but in my wealthy european country it's too easy to receive undeserved ""disability to work"" credit payed for by the income tax of the working class. And that is what possibly annoys me the most. Although this is an assumption, most gypsies actually receive this credit in my country.

How would the stoics deal with this? To be not disturbed by externals? But that does not stop them from bothering people right? Was Diogenes not a beggar himself?

Women trying to make me go against the Stoic path...,"I am naturally very stoic and live extremely minimal. I do not see a virtue in being minimal, i just do not desire material wealth.

In modern society, people always seem to comment on this and try to act as though it is some kind of a problem - especially women who try to come into my life. I eat minimally, but enough. I usually drink only water. I hardly contact anyone. I am very content with this - i need no luxury. I write and create art. I have very little furniture - mainly books. But women seem to try cause problems over this - call me antisocial, say i need to show more emotion, say i need to decorate, say i need to relax (even tho i am), after we make love they want me to be emotional...

Women will literally get mad with me because i am not reactive to things in the same way they wish to be - they get mad when i say i don't want certain possessions, or when i do not see the point in certain status symbols, etc.  I can be content with pretty much anything meanwhile they will complain at me...

I will interject here and say that obviously if i have a long standing relationship with a women i have been with for years then of course i will be perhaps more lenient for the sake of her happiness because of my love for her. But outside of a situation like that, i will remain laconic and firm.

I find myself declining dates with women because they always expect me to break my virtues for the sake of their expediency; especially in regards to buying objects and other material aspects of life. Or when they ask for my advice and i give them Stoic advice - which they hate.

Anybody else found this to be the case? Is it best to just not date for a while? How do others go about navigating these aspects of modernity whilst remaining Stoic, when it seems people actively try to go against the path?",Stoicism,1692704359.0,t3_15y39dl,0.39,0

Wanting to transition from Christianity to Stoicism,"Hey y’all, I’m hoping this is keeping in line with rule 2 (newbie here) I want to preface this by saying I’m not a theologian or an expert on stoicism, I’m just a 22 year old guy looking for direction and resources while I try to make an informed decision. Because I’m neither a theologian or a philosopher I will make some incorrect statements and misunderstandings so I’d love to be educated on any errors I make. 

I’ve never shared this with anyone in my personal life, so I apologize if this is too long or I ramble on too long. TL;DR at the bottom.

My background in Christianity comes from growing up in the Bible Belt and being raised in the church since I was baptized as a baby. While I love the core teachings of Jesus and the way of life we’re supposed to follow,  I don’t feel like I’ve truly accepted Christ as my savior. I’ve struggled with doubt from an early age. I would say they are pretty common doubts like miracles, creationism, literal vs. figurative interpretation, etc. I wasn’t really allowed to explore these questions with the people in my life and was dealt with some pretty frustrating answers, like the classic, “because the Bible says so”. It felt like exploring these issues was wrong and I just needed to shut up and believe. 

I’ve also noticed some of the negative aspects of Christian culture that I’m working on deconstructing now like, intolerance of others, nationalism, and political agendas tied into faith.

There’s so many negatives to christian culture that I find it hard to even want to associate myself with it. Like purity culture, the new satanic panic conspiracies, mega-churches, and all the big figures associated with them.

My dissatisfaction with the church and the cultural issues are what led me to exploring Stoicism. As of now, I’ve only read “Meditations” and “Letters from a Stoic”, so I’ll admit I have a long path of learning ahead of me. Despite this, they have left a deep impact on me and I’ve found myself wanting to pursue the idea of living a stoic life and studying the philosophy. 

I like that there are similarities between Stoicism and Christianity that make it feel like I’m creating a positive alternative in my life, instead of creating a vacuum. Stuff like living a life of virtue, self-discipline, and not worrying about things outside of your control really appeal to me.

As someone who deals with mental health issues, I can also say that I’ve found more resilience in myself by reading those two books than the nervous reassurance “God will heal you from this” that I’ve received in the past. 

I’m not expecting Stoicism to fix all my problems or magically change my life in an instant. I also know it’s not without its faults, but I think that this is the next best step for what direction my life should take and I want to begin the work. 

So with all of that, I’d really appreciate advice on what or who I should read to learn more about stoicism and ways to implement it in my daily life, as I continue to explore this transition. 

TL;DR- I’m a christian debating leaving the faith because of doubt and the problematic culture and looking for resources to research stoicism before I make a switch.

Edit: Thank y’all again for the replies and advice given, I don’t usually put myself out there a lot so I really appreciate everyone’s thoughts. I’m coming to the conclusion that this isn’t an either/or situation and that I can take the good from both and apply it to live a better life and not worry about labels or what others think.

How to stop gatekeeping soon??,"Hello, 

As title says I want to learn to stop gatekeeping. 

For context, Spider-Man NWH comes out in 4 days and I'm feeling a strong resistance and very gatekeepy right now. 

I've been a Spider-Man fan my entire life, I've been reading the comics since I was a young lad and I'm covered in Spider-Man tattoos as a 21 year old man. 

Now as someone who is really into Spider-Man, it makes me annoyed when I see others showing excitement for Spider-Man NWH even though they aren't long term fans and more recently got into the character and lore. Especially people from highschool who use to bully me posting about the movie on Snapchat.

I always feel frustrated or a urge to ""protect"" or ""fact check"" people whenever they try to talk about the new movie with me or just post about it on social media. 

Now I'm 100% aware the reason I gatekeep is because I've made it such a part of my identity, and I'm scared that if other people are into the stuff I'm into, then nothing makes me unique and special, I'll just be an average Joe. 

I just want to be able to relax and enjoy Spider-Man NWH in 4 days without feeling like I have to PROVE IM THE BIGGEST FAN!!!! I want to share this excitement with others and rejoice at the fact that new fans are coming in because of this. But my ego won't let me. I'm aware it's a problem but don't know what to do or how to stop.

I know all this sounds incredibly silly coming from a 21 year old and I'll probably look back on this post and laugh, but right now this gatekeeping is bothering the fuck outta me and I wanna just let go and enjoy myself.

meat eaters are dumb(er),"τὴν μέντοι κρεώδη τροφὴν θηριωδεστέραν ἀπέφηνε καὶ τοῖς ἀγρίοις ζῴοις προσφορωτέραν. εἶναι δὲ ταύτην ἔλεγε καὶ βαρυτέραν καὶ τῷ νοεῖν τι καὶ φρονεῖν ἐμπόδιον· τὴν γὰρ ἀναθυμίασιν τὴν ἀπ´ αὐτῆς θολωδεστέραν οὖσαν ἐπισκοτεῖν τῇ ψυχῇ· παρὸ καὶ βραδυτέρους φαίνεσθαι τὴν διάνοιαν τοὺς πλείονι ταύτῃ χρωμένους. 

My trans:

Musonius demonstrated that meat is an uncivilised food stuff and more appropriate for wild animals. He argued that it is a heavy food that serves as an obstacle for the understanding and inteligence, because the exhalations that emanate from meat, being turbid, end up darkening the soul. It is for this reason that people who eat a lot of meat seem to be rather slow in intelligence. 

He goes on to say: 

δεῖν δὲ τὸν ἄνθρωπον, ὥσπερ συγγενέστατον τοῖς θεοῖς τῶν ἐπιγείων ἐστίν, οὕτω καὶ
ὁµοιότατα τρέφεσθαι τοῖς θεοῖς. ἐκείνοις µὲν οὖν ἀρκεῖν τοὺς ἀπὸ γῆς καὶ ὕδατος ἀναφεροµένους
ἀτµούς, ἡµᾶς δ' ὁµοιοτάτην ταύτῃ προσφέρεσθαι τροφὴν ἂν εἶπεν τὴν κουφοτάτην καὶ καθαρω τάτην·
οὕτω δ' ἂν καὶ τὴν ψυχὴν ἡµῶν ὑπάρχειν καθαράν τε καὶ ξηράν, ὁποία οὖσα ἀρίστη καὶ σοφωτάτη εἴη ἄν.

Man is the closest among the living beings in familial closeness to the gods, he must also nourish himself in like manner to the gods. The vapors that arise from the earth and from the water are enough for the gods, and so man too should eat food that might be similar in character to these elements, that is to say, the most pure and dry kind of food. Having a soul that is pure and dry in this way, he might become noble and wise. 

The last sentence is diff to translate into good English while following the Greek closely.

For similar sentiments (and about frugal eating) see this post: http://laudatortemporisacti.blogspot.ca/2014/07/fat-paunches-have-lean-pates.html

 I don't actually believe meat eaters are as a general rule dumber, but it is funny to read it in this great Stoic thinker. It's a good mix of Stoic physics and how it is integral to Stoic ethics.

Ryan Holiday isn't controversial figure of modern stoicism just because of envy of his success.,"Maybe a bit controversial title. But i think people here should know who is Ryan Holiday. 

There is huge part of people that don't really like Ryan. Some complain about his marketing practices, some don't see any benefits in his work, some don't like the ""self-help vibe"" and some arguments are about his overpriced coins or courses. Every argument is valid, but some of them sounds like envy. 

I personally ""consume"" Ryan on daily basis for few months. I watch reels on Instagram, longer videos every Saturday on YouTube and reading daily stoic book every morning. Few years ago i also read Obstacle is the Way and reread it few weeks ago. So, I would say, I know his work around stoicism quite well. 

Some of Ryan's background: he worked in marketing on really high position and wrote critical book about marketing after leaving that field. His mentor is Robert Greene (48 Laws of power, and in few subreddits really popular book Art of seduction). He is married, father of 2 kids, and what he said in his videos he basically maintain relationship with his wife from really young age (around 19 he started dating her, if i remember well). Few years ago he opened really interesting bookstore (i will write more about it later). That's his background in nutshell. 

I also ""consume"" Robert Greene reels and sometimes i watch interview with him or his own 5-10 minutes talking videos on his YouTube channel. I've never finished any of his book, but i listed through 48 Laws and understood what he wants to tell his readers. 

I understand why Ryan getting here so much hate. His background from marketing could evoke some negativity, and if you check his courses it seems more like ""cult membership"" than philosophy learning. Also selling coins with ""memento mori"" or ""amor fati"", and some framed quotes seems more like orient style market than serious eshop. Also some people could be disgusted by his cooperation with Robert Greene because ""his books are for sociopaths and pick up artists!"". 

But try to look at him from different angle. He most probably practice what he preaches. Tattoos, he is consistent in what he saying and writing about and he is not changing people that he is friend with in public eye. He is friend with Robert Greene, and he took the right from him like style of writing, historical stories that underline rightness of his point. He is able to maintain monogamous relationship although he is famous and still relatively young. He lives in countryside, so he most probably like animals and nature. He might have lot of money, but he never showed his car, hotel in which he stayed, expensive watch nor vacation destination. He keeps his private life relatively closed from his public life. He never advertised something that is not related to stoicism, only books of other authors, not blender, parfume or restaurant. He opened bookstore with just few hundred books. Books that he consider useful for life. Novel, poetry, original works from stoics, Epicurus, Plutarch, biographies of principled or inspirational historical figures like Zemurray, Frankl, Churchill or Rockefeller. Books that he personally read (some of them even multiple times) and consider them good to sell them in his own bookstore. Have you heard any controversy about him, drugs, fights, drunk driving, affair or sexual abusing? Me neither. (If you want to argue this, just google name ""Christopher J. Hadnagy"", not really famous writer outside tech community, but he was famous enough to be controversial). 

What i wanted to say with that whole novel? To be honest, nothing new or life changing. I understand why people here don't like Ryan, but they most probably don't understand him. He is not typical self-help influencer like Mark Manson or generic ""productivity, happiness, and make more money"" gurus that are everywhere and they are basically the same, just different faces. He doing great job in terms of making stoicism extremely accessible. Wouldn't that accessibility was goal of every ancient stoic? One was principled emperor (Marcus Aurelius). Epictetus was lecturing slave. Seneca was cool businessman that don't really cared about his fortune, he just enjoyed what he got. But all of them tried to help others prokoptons or just ordinary people around them to live better life. Ryan seems like them. Although his selling practices, we should value him. Just because he did stoicism so accessible. And also, he seems like principled man that don't value consumerism, flexing or advertising anything just because ""it pays well"". He exclusively advertising his own shit to make living, and i admire that.

You might dont see Ryan as someone beneficial to our community, because you don't need his content to study stoicism. That's great you are so advanced that you understand ancient books without guidance. But you are most probably small minority. Stoicism was always about community study, or mentors lectures. We have this huge community, because it's part of stoicism to discuss and learn from more wise prokoptons. He do positive advertising for us (he also mentioned our community in book Obstacle is the Way). More concerning should be red*illers, Andr*w Tat* fans or nof*p community. That's not that great advertisement.

Why I’m NOT skipping/fast forwarding through ads,"I feel like this may apply to Stoicism, but I can’t quite put it into words. 
Anyway, recently, I’ve been deciding to NOT skip over ads and commercials. I’m not necessarily paying attention to the ads or patronizing the sponsors, but I am resisting the urge to skip them. The reason is that I think skipping through ads makes me more impatient and makes me develop an attitude of instant gratification. I need to remember that nothing in this world is free. The creation of content, even the silliest video on the internet, takes time and effort, and when a video is accompanied by sponsorship or ads, that is the payment for that content. Not skipping over the ad makes me invested, and makes me more likely to appreciate the content when it arrives. Of course there are videos where the content itself is so insubstantial that it becomes merely a delivery method for the sponsorships. In those cases I avoid those content creators in the future. The point is that I think deliberately not skipping over ads nurtures patience and gratitude. 
Any thoughts? Am I full of it?

Any Stoics turned Pyrrhonian?,"I used to be a Stoic but now I find it too dogmatic, making assumptions that certain things are to be considered good and others bad, with no evidence that this is indeed the case.   

I feel like Stoicism was a step in the wrong direction from the Skeptics. Yes, you can't refute ALL knowledge, but you can certainly refute absolute value statements. 

Helping someone else isn't inherently good or bad, it's just helping someone else. Virtue assumes dogma..

I'm now a Pyrrhonian skepticist. I achieve ataraxia through suspension of judgement, and I refrain from making propositions or judgements about non-evident matters.

"I need something I can't have (women's touch), and it is destroying me","I am going to tell a story that is based on real events in a way I don't dox myself 

In the local park there is a vibrant wildlife. There are many trees with squirrels, monkeys climbing and birds flying all around. But then there are two very distinguishable macaws. Even tho these macaws peacefully share the environment with the other animals, they are always a couple. No matter what they are doing, what the others are doing, they remain in each other's company, and it has been this way for years. It is real, I only changed the animals. 

This lifestyle seen in nature, therefore natural, is in me. I am extremely introverted, I don't need to be in a group like many others, I don't need friends with me all the time BUT I need a woman, I really do. I am not saying I think I need, I guarantee this based on previous experiences

This is where my stoic self fails. I am not supposed to look to others more than to myself, and still I get really upset that it is so easy for my colleagues in university to be around with girls, and get touching from them while it is extremely difficult to me. 

Or like Marcus Aurelius says, all wax-drops fall, some earlier some later but all do. If I am to think of this, there will be a time in which I will love a woman that loves me, but for some reason, it feels like a filthy lie, I have zero hopes on that. I don't know how to explain properly.

Also, it is completely natural, I have seen evidence with my own eyes that it is, why do I still feel that this is wrong? 

I actually know why, I have said this to my psychiatrist before. It is because of how people treated me in the past, and how they continue to treat me. But why do I let others hurt me? I don't know. It is because I actually believe I am weak for wanting to be touched and loved so when they say this to me I let it hit me, but why do I believe in this?

I can't apply my beliefs onto you, and I can't be mad at you for doing what you think is right. I have no room to judge.

How do you feel about Ryan Holiday?,"You could say that he was my „mentor“ in some form, because he introduced me to stoicism in the first place, for which I am forever grateful and thankful, but the more I got to know about him and his past (corporate) life, I was getting concerned. 

Learning more about stoicism made me think that how he portrays the teachings and theories of this ancient philosophy is more of an approach of making it profitable (for himself) and yes, accessible for everyone, but doesn’t stoicism teach that glory, power and money are not things we should strive for?

I mean, didn’t Epictetus say that we should practice stoicism only for ourselves and in stillness without the dogmatism of preaching it to other people? That we should learn of the practice of Socrates and be a „hidden philosopher“? 

Don’t get me wrong - I think it’s great that so many people are learning about it and find deep fulfillment in these teachings, as do I.

Losing my faith in Stoicism,"I have always thought of stoicism to be a very good foundation to build a good life; a rational virtue system built on the foundation that all people matter and that people ultimately want to help each other. It felt like a pro-social, life affirming philosophy that placed altruism and discipline at the center, and provided a justification both for complex civilizations and for harnessing the power of those civilizations to enrich the lives of all members within it.

The problem is, I no longer believe that acting altruistically is part of all or even most people's nature. I feel like altruism is actually a cultural construct, one which is falling apart right before our very eyes. How else can we explain all of the anti-social behavior we see around us? The standard stoic response of ""these people are not acting within their nature"" feels hollow to me.

Let me give a quick laundry list of some of the anti-social behavior currently being perpetrated on a global scale.

1. Putin's senseless invasion of Ukraine and slaughter of citizens there.

2. The continued destruction of our planet by the fossil fuel industry.

3. People saying with a straight face that they would prefer immuno-compromised individuals to die than to wear a cloth mask.

4. The United States shrugging its shoulders in response to nineteen children and two adults being slaughtered.

Like I said, looking at these events and saying ""these people are not acting within their nature"" feels absurd. It feels much more reasonable to say that being pro-social is not, in fact, within people's nature. I would go so far as to say that acting within one's self interest is not within people's nature; none of the acts I mentioned are ultimately beneficial to the individuals perpetrating them -- they fill their lives with conflict, and may lead them to short and horrifying ends.

It seems much more reasonable to me to say that people's natures are ultimately irrational and arbitrary; that there is no fundamental human nature one can appeal to or cultivate. If a person has somehow programmed themselves to believe that their ethical worth is based on how much wealth or power they accrue, then there is no fundamental nature that they can return to; they become like the proverbial paper clip generating super intelligence; a machine which, because it has no better goal to aspire to, generates paper clips until it destroys itself and its environment.

Stoicism then begins to feel like senseless, iron-man style, asceticism -- the kind of performative asceticism which proves willpower but doesn't achieve anything beyond that.

I would love to return to it, as it is an amazing philosophy if you believe in it. But I cannot force myself to believe something arbitrarily.",Stoicism,1656918667.0,t3_vr1m7e,0.56,2

Which pleasures did you choose to abstain from after adopting stoicism?,"Seneca strongly urges us to avoid anything that's considered liberal arts, he tells us to avoid all the distractions(Pleasures) and solely focus on our work.

On the other hand, Seneca wrote plays and literature therefore I am quite confused, so were the plays that Seneca wrote his calling in life, or were they a pleasure he chose to indulge in?

Is Jason Mraz a stoic?,"I am not the first person to bring up this exact same scenario (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/8ielsw/stoic_messages_in_jason_mraz_im_yours/)), but I wanted to revisit the topic and do my own breakdown of Jason Mraz's song ""I'm Yours"" ([youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkHTsc9PU2A)).

&#x200B;

The backstory is that I've been reading my first official stoic book, ""Meditations"" (unless you count listening to Ryan Holiday's audio book ""The Obstacle is the Way"" and on the radio the other day is the aforementioned song by Mr. A to Z. I was suddenly thunderstruck by how much the song seemed to parallel a lot of Mr. Aurelius' observations on stoicism. Am I just projecting because my brain is saturated with his thoughts? Or is Jason Mraz secretly writing stoic lyrics? Let's discuss!

Here are the original lyrics without my notes:

*Well you done done me and you bet I felt it*  
*I tried to be chill but you're so hot I melted*  
*I fell right through the cracks*  
*And now I'm trying to get back*  
*Before the cool done run out*  
*I'll be giving it my best-est*  
*And nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention*  
*I reckon it's again my turn,*  
*To win some or learn some*  
*But I won't hesitate no more, no more*  
*It cannot wait, I'm yours*  
*Well open up your mind and see like me*  
*Open up your plans and damn you're free*  
*Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love*  
*Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing*  
*We are just one big family*  
*And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved*  
*So I won't hesitate no more, no more*  
*It cannot wait I'm sure*  
*There's no need to complicate*  
*Our time is short*  
*This is our fate, I'm yours*  
*D-d-do do you, but do you, d-d-do*  
*But do you want to come on*  
*Scooch on over closer dear*  
*And I will nibble your ear*  
*Oh oh*  
*I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror*  
*And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer*  
*But my breath fogged up the glass*  
*And so I drew a new face and I laughed*  
*I guess what I been saying is there ain't no better reason*  
*To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons*  
*It's what we aim to do*  
*Our name is our virtue*  
*But I won't hesitate no more, no more*

And here they are again with my notes. I would love some of the more well read prokopton's on here to comment.

*Well you done done me and you bet I felt it*  
*I tried to be chill but you're so hot I melted*  
*I fell right through the cracks*  
*And now I'm trying to get back*

**Now, I'm not going to try to pretend he's not singing about someone else... that seems obvious. But here he mentions trying to get back... to being chill? Metaphor for being the master of your emotions?**

*Before the cool done run out*  
*I'll be giving it my best-est*

**MA always says to do your best!**

*And nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention*

**MA also mentions that divinity is the only external influence that can affect your happiness. (Could use a correction here, if I am mistaken.)**

*I reckon it's again my turn,*  
*To win some or learn some*

**Doesn't MA say something about doing away with books and learning directly? Kinda like life experience huh?**

*But I won't hesitate no more, no more*  
*It cannot wait, I'm yours*

**Don't waste time!**

  
*Well open up your mind and see like me*

**I think this was the line that originally struck me. Stoics talk about changing your perception in order to control your emotions. MA talks about stripping away illusion and describing very scientifically what something is.**

  
*Open up your plans and damn you're free*

**Could this be a reference to fate? Accepting what happens to you?**

  
*Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love*

**One of my favorite stoic maxims: Every person is an opportunity for kindness.**

  
*Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing*

**Stay in the present. Can't change the past, and the future hasn't happened yet.**

  
*We are just one big family*

**MA talks about how were part of the elements, the universe, etc.**  


*And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved*  
*So I won't hesitate no more, no more*  
*It cannot wait I'm sure*  
*There's no need to complicate*  
*Our time is short*

**Look at all this talk about time!**  


*This is our fate, I'm yours*

**MA describes fate as more like what has happened to you, rather than what will happen to you. Jason might be talking about predetermination here, but I still see a connection.**

  
*D-d-do do you, but do you, d-d-do*  
*But do you want to come on*  
*Scooch on over closer dear*  
*And I will nibble your ear*  
*Oh oh*

**Ugh, back to that person he's so in love with. Gross.**

  
*I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror*  
*And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer*  
*But my breath fogged up the glass*  
*And so I drew a new face and I laughed*

**Another reference to mastering emotions and choosing how to feel about things?**

  
*I guess what I been saying is there ain't no better reason*  
*To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons*  
*It's what we aim to do*  
*Our name is our virtue*

**Sounds like MA's incessant talk of ""nature"", being rational, and being your best.**

  
*But I won't hesitate no more, no more*  
*It cannot wait I'm yours*  
*Well open up your mind and see like me*  
*Open up your plans and damn you're free*  
*Look into your heart and you'll find the sky is yours*  
*So please don't please don't please don't*  
*There's no need to complicate*  
*'Cause our time is short*  
*This, oh this, this is our fate, I'm yours*

People hate me for speaking the truth,"I admit I have been tactless most of the time. I've only been very realistic.

I am going to be a Stoic from now on,"Hello Everyone,

I hope you are all well. Recently, I was in a spiritual stalemate, after being a strong Buddhist for a year. I did look into stoicism for a few weeks but then was stuck on what to follow: Stoicism, Buddhism or Hinduism.

It came to me that I was trying to find something that would give me a form of self. In Buddhism, I was practicing non-self as I perceiving myself to have no self. But, I soon realised I was being attached to Buddhism itself for the sake of my self (ironic isn’t it?).

So, realising the above, I formally said to myself I would compassionately go away from Buddhism in terms of practice/being a Buddhist.

Who knows, my Spiritual Path has been a winding road, but, I have fully accepted to be a stoic and it is massive relief, to know I can figure out I do have control (a degree of) in any situation. The dichotomy of control has helped me a lot. 

I’m sure this sub reddit will help a lot.

I have a few questions:

- I have bought a daily Stoic book. What is the one book, in Stoicism, that is beginner level and easy to understand?

- Is there a God in Stoicism? If so, do I have to believe in a god to be a stoic.

- Am I still allowed to read other religious/philosophical texts? I want to keep an open mind, which is why I intend to keep a single book from a single religion.

The obstacle is the way. Daily Stoic lessons have calmed me.,"""The world is constantly testing us. We set out to do something and it’s more trying than we expect. We face resistance. We get criticized. We run out of options. We experience technical difficulties. What will we do?

Marcus Aurelius would say that the Stoic finds a way to turn every negative into a positive. In this famous line, “The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.” what he’s suggesting is that—no matter how bad or seemingly undesirable a situation becomes—we always have the opportunity to practice virtue, to use the situation as an opportunity to be our best selves. We don’t control when things get hard, but we always control how we respond. We can show patience, courage, humility, resourcefulness, reason, justice, and creativity. The things that test us make us who we are.

The Stoic grows stronger and better with every obstacle they face. They rally to every challenge and thrive as a result. So can you.""

I signed up for the daily emails from Daily Stoic and I read every single one. The perspective is always clear and concise and I'd say the feeling I get consistently from the readings is that of humility. The emails calm me. 

Anyone else subscribed and feeling calm? Stoicism has really helped me slow down and rid myself of unnecessary anxiety. Everyone always wishes they cared less of what other people thought and embracing mortality certainly does wonders for that. 

This post is unnecessary but I really just wanted to show gratitude for the Daily Stoic. Excellent items in their store as well.",Stoicism,1559396185.0,t3_bvkv5l,0.59,3
Origin of the name Epictetus,"> Epictetus was a Greek Stoic philosopher. He was born a slave at Hierapolis, Phrygia and lived in Rome until his banishment, when he went to Nicopolis in northwestern Greece for the rest of his life.     
   
His name comes from ""Epic"" and ""Tits"". His slave mother had epic breast's and since she was a slave, the owner of her named her child, Epictetus, after his mothers ""Epic tits"". Since the mother had 2 tits, owner formed the plural ""tits => tetus"" and named our young philosopher ""Epictetus"".

I feel frustrated that I am staying friends with my ex while they already have a new lover.,"I have.. an interesting relationship dynamic to say the least. And yes, I know you must be thinking why I'm not posting this on r/relationship_advice or what not. I will be doing that too. To me, this is a problem that i might need, or in this case, will need a lot of stoic advice to carry on and process myself. Thank you all in advance.

My story is as follows. Well, the short and long of it as I have yet to fully comprehend what has happened for how long. 

The gist of it is that after a seriously heated debate between me and my then-girlfriend. She decided that she doesnt want to be my girlfriend anymore. But we've still kept contact since, sometimes texting almost daily. I keep going on the pretense that maybe if I show her how much I care, how hard Im trying, then maybe she'll build enough trust for me to consider getting back. That lasted for a month, or two. And while all that was going on, in the midst of me constantly trying to mend that broken relationship, she was out having fun with another person, flirting with them, all the while still demanding/expecting things from me. Sometimes she would say that she wants to get back together but she is still so hurt by the past that she cant do so. Opting instead to become uncaring towards me and actively showing me that she is willing to defend another person. Something that she has never once done for me in the past.

At somepoint in that strained relationship a fight between us broke out because of how she thought i was so uncaring of her, even with her constant disregarding of my feelings. That ended in me cutting ties.. or so I though as I once again messaged her later, simply saying to want to say how much Ive loved her and how I'll be going away. This then resulted in us meeting up, while only after a day from our last, she has decided to become partners with the other person i was talking about before. We talked, and I somehow convinced myself that staying friends with her was the better choice. But witnessing her treat another person how I've always wanted to be treated just breaks my heart. I'm jealous of it, envious of how I can't have been the one. I don't know how to deal with these feelings. Or how to process myself moving forward. 

On one hand, I would like to stay to maybe gain a chance at rebuilding their trust and affection once more.

On the other, I know that by doing so, I risk myself not ever fully recovering from this relationship and tying myself down to it. 

Any stoic advice is extremely helpful as I do not know what I should be doing with myself moving forward. The thought of revenge does come to mind, but I do not think such shallowness is the right way to fulfillment and me being actually happy. Nor am I able to think of anyways of revenge lol. So please, as Stoics, please give me your advice on this topic... I am in dire need of help.

EDIT: I couldnt reply to every comment there is on this little post of mine. Im glad to have so many people give advice and pay mind to my problem. I thank you all for the kind words and will now continue studying the path of Stoicism so that one day I will be lucky enough to be able to apply the teachings of Stoicism to my life. And be able to give out such enlightening advices like the rest of us here. Peace and love be with you all.",Stoicism,1695148614.0,t3_16mypeq,0.63,14
"The war in Gaza is threatens to change my values, I seek advice in these difficult times."," Hi folks, This is my first post to this subreddit. Though I am a long-time subscriber. I hope to receive advice in these difficult times.   


I (38m) am married with 3 children. I am a physician in Israel, my speciality is psychiatry. I would consider myself an aspiring Stoic. for years I have read little by little Marcus's meditations and for the past 6 months I have dedicated 10 minutes every day to study or contemplate Stoic ideals, I try to live virtuously as best I can (most of the time). I do not actually pretend to be a true Stoic. Just someone on a journey to become one. stoicism helped me through the toughest times in residency. Epictetus helped me deal with abusive directors, and Marcus helped me keep it through countless 26-hour shifts treating human suffering in its rawest forms.  


I always considered myself a strong advocate of the concept of cosmopolitism.  Stoicism helped me keep my compassion when I was deployed for more than a year to do forensic work in the worst prison in the country. I worked with rapists and murderers and almost always I saw the human behind the mistakes (there were 2 exceptions) . I did not find evil in prison. just lost people wandering in ignorance.   


No one knows about my stoic ideals. Even my wife only has a vague notion that I have an unusual fondness to the late Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius blessed be his soul.   


But now I find myself at a difficulty, for the first time I find myself unable to reconcile my stoic ideals with what is happening around me. and what is happening to me.   


a week ago my nation was struck by a heinous terrorist attack from Hamas.   


The terrorists killed more than 1200 people. Almost all of them are civilians. They massacred a music vestige and took some of the girls captive after they disgraced them.   


Then they swept through the towns close to the border. Our people hid in their houses shutting the doors. So They swept house to house killing or capturing people. Some of the younger children were captured in animal cages and taken to the strip. When it was out on social media that the enemy was sweeping homes some people panicked and ran and were massacred unceremoniously.   


My friend hid in a safe room in his house for 50 minutes with an axe and with his wife and kid while the terrorists were inside.   
He requested support on social media but No one came (the terrorists did not find them and they survived)   


Now my nation is consumed in the drive for vengeance. And I am no exception. I wish the enemy pay in tears and blood for the atrocities they committed. I do not feel the compassion I once had toward the enemy. And I am ashamed to say I don't care. I do not know how to reconcile this.   


Thucydides once said that war is a cruel teacher. In the manner that values change.  The sanctity of human life is replaced by the drive for vengeance   


I feel that this is happening to me. I wish to continue my Stoic journey. But I cannot shake the deep hatred and thirst for vengeance. I seek guidance in these difficult times.",Stoicism,1697229941.0,t3_17789ua,0.74,466
Fear of climate change stems from attachment to old ways of living.,"People who deny and downplay climate change always talk in terms of fears.

These are childish entitlements. The earth owes us nothing. Our ancestors could do these things, but conditions changed. 

The people who want to continue to consume these things will have to do so with the knowledge that the clock is ticking - knowledge that will make them feel shitty.

"I didn't have much, but I just lost everything.","My business partner referred me to stoicism. He said something about taking things as they come and understanding what is and is not in your control. Anyways it resonated. Let me back up though.

Long story short:

I am 23 and my now ex-girlfriend was 29. I left my laptop at her place one day after seeing her for 9 months. She found evidence of my cheating on her and proceeded to empty my bank accounts and throw all of my belongings in the street. I am already in huge credit card debt, and this kicked whatever depression I think I am suffering of at least a couple notches.

What is fucking me up is that I believe I loved her, the other were about sex. The greater issue is that I want to accept whatever happened and be grateful for everything that happened, even when now I have nothing.

"Is the hero from ""The Fountainhead"" a Stoic?","I just read ""The Fountainhead"" by Ayn Rand, because everyone seems to be saying how horrible her books are. I don't know if her other books are horrible, but I actually thought Fountainhead was good. Very good, actually. Perhaps not in all conclusions, and despite the preachiness of some of the protagonists, but still, I wish I had read this book sooner.

I think the book was almost Buddhist in its analysis of the world, except it seemed to reach the opposite conclusion: That the Ego is actually what is best about humans. And I think what the book's hero Howard Roark does and says was quite Stoic: He does not care about the opinions of others, he does not care if he has to do manual labor, he does not judge people superficially etc. At times reading about him was like reading ""Meditations"".

Anyway, there were things that I disliked about this book, but so far I think that Ayn Rand is being treated unfairly in popular opinion (as far as I can tell anyway).

Stoicism doesn’t make sense without God,"Let me address the elephant in the room and the area where I see the most confusion around Stoicism. And also why Stoicism especially appealed to me and made sense for me as someone with a Muslim background. 

If you study Stoic theology and ethics of good and evil you’ll see that Stoics believed virtue and vice comes from God. 

Stoics believe that God created a logical and virtuous universe and created the best logical conditions for us to live in:

>	The first sense of the definition [stoic ethics] is living in accordance with nature as a whole, i.e. the entire cosmos. Cosmic nature (the universe), the Stoics firmly believed, is a rationally organized and well-ordered system, and indeed coextensive with the will of Zeus, the impersonal god. Consequently, all events that occur within the universe fit within a coherent, well-structured scheme that is providential. Since there is no room for chance within this rationally ordered system, the Stoics’ metaphysical determinism further dictated that this cosmic Nature is identical to fate. Thus at this level, “living in agreement with nature” means conforming one’s will with the sequence of events that are fated to occur in the rationally constituted universe, as providentially willed by Zeus.

https://iep.utm.edu/stoiceth/

You have to understand that Stoicism is in direct opposition of Epicureanism at the time. 

Epicurus was the atheistic materialist philosopher. 

>	Ancient critics thought the Epicurean gods were a thin smoke-screen to hide Epicurus’ atheism, and difficulties with a literal interpretation of Epicurus’ sayings on the nature of the gods (for instance, it appears inconsistent with Epicurus’ atomic theory to hold that any compound body, even a god, could be immortal) have led some scholars to conjecture that Epicurus’ ‘gods’ are thought-constructs, and exist only in human minds as idealizations, i.e., the gods exist, but only as projections of what the most blessed life would be.

https://iep.utm.edu/epicur/#H3

So you can see the dichotomy here. 

The Stoics believed in a subjective, moralistic universe, and we just have to be objective to realize it and live with the inherent order and intelligence in it.

The Epicureans believed in an objective, “matter and void” universe, in we have to subjectively derive and project our values on it to enjoy our life. 

Many Stoics on these forums really aren’t Stoics but Epicureans. 

And really would be much better suited to study Epicurus and his teachings. 

Because Stoicism, without the inherent virtue of the universe, is rather empty. 

Stoics don’t discipline themselves merely to adapt to the hardships of life. 

But they believe in doing so, they become their best possible selves. 

The whole idea of overcoming one’s ego, the knee jerk reactivity of the psyche, is so one would be in tune with divine wisdom and live their life in the most virtuous way. 

Stoicism is most and foremost a philosophy of meaning. Of feeling proud and having a sense of belonging with the universe as a whole. 

It is not a philosophy of pain and pleasure. 

Pain and pleasure are merely seen as a veil standing in the way of true fulfillment and euodymonoa. 

I wish more people would study original sources or at least, credible sources, and not rely on a lot of pop culture, white washed explanations of Stoicism. Because they will end up with a broken philosophy that simply won’t work.",Stoicism,1672145658.0,t3_zwf0bf,0.35,0

What things are determine what things do. Is this true? What does stoicism have say to this?,"Here's the gist:

* What SHOULD I do and why SHOULD I do that?
* Wants a clear life direction.
* Tries to figure it out for months.
* Can't figure it out. Isn't satisfied with any answer. Finds despair instead.
* Has trouble doing anything cause of not knowing why he does what he does, or for that matter, why does ANYTHING at all do what they do?
* Reaches some sort of conclusion, which he still doesn't find satisfying so then asks reddit cause doesn't know where else.

~~~

The conclusion:

- Things just exists.
- These things exist in certain ways.
- The ways that these things exist can change.

This is reality.


What things are determine what things do, and what things do determine what things are to be.

ie. What a thing is and what surrounds that thing (the universe/ the earth/ society) determines what it does, and what it does determines what it becomes and what surrounds it becomes. 


If this is true, then:

What to do?
What you do is determined by what you are and what other things are.

Why do that?
What is done is done because of what you are and what other things are.

So is it that simple? I wake up, I eat, I bathe, I study, I draw, I choose a goal, I love, I survive etc. all because of what I am and what surrounds me? Is it logical?

How to not fuel relationship argument fires?,"Throwaway because too careful and never like to discuss things publicly.


And please no advice about breaking up the marriage, just save that please.   I love them thoroughly and entirely.


Need some stoic advise on dealing with high emotion relationship times.  Stoicism has helped greatly in my relationship but still not close to 100% (and nothing is…).  Not sure if there are some mantras or practices that could help, but a typical every 3-6 month argument goes:


1. Something triggers it, simple fake example: Tension is high and we both knock over milk.


2 . They get emotional and upset, cry and say mean things: “You are stupid you spilled the milk because you #$@!$ing clumsy.”


3. I get emotional and say mean things back: “No you are stupid, you are !@#!ing untidy and left it there!""


Now this is where the issue is. The argument now is about me cussing at them and calling them untidy.  For the next 3 days, they wont talk to me, crying, sad, sleeping on couch. To me, we were high emotions, tensions, they start cussing with accusations, and I return… I forgive them for saying I’m clumsy, what they said was a high emotional time, we were upset of the milk… But to them, now I’m the ""POS that called them untidy, this is unforgivable and now what the argument is about!”    


I’ve seen this pattern again and again, and try to walk away.  I go to stoic quotes on the reddit and internet, try to think deeply on it. Try to come to them and start healing sooner instead letting it dwell.  Stoicism has helped me greatly and I would say it’s taken the fuel out of a LOT of argument fires.  A possible 3 day fight is over in 2 hours… I love them.
 

But it's not perfect, and over the weekend we had another one.  This time I felt like I stayed calm, explained how I felt as calm as I could. but apparently It still hurt their feelings, and now we are both hurt on day 3, and the fight is now about the higher emotion argument.  This time they said I seemed mocking (I sometimes chuckle when in tense moments but thats nothing new).  I’ll own up to it, as I can see what they could have likely seen.  Especially if they are at a 10 on emotions and I’m at a 2 and trying to leave the room… But to me is all seems like a trap.   If someone yells at you, and if you yell back you are 10x more in trouble… Emotions are high and 1. 'Explaining it' has a high probability of being used against you.  2. ‘Leaving' is better but also bad.  3. ‘Letting them vent’ seems like safest but it puts all the stress on my capabilities which I lack (on top of having my own stressors and vulnerabilities).

Im a lost cause,"
I’m not suicidal but I’ve been on self improvement for such a long time and my life isn’t getting any better. It’s leading me to question why I am here and how can someone be so purposeless like me. 

Journaling, meditation, gratitude, and gym has been a very important part of my life for the past 7 months. 

My self esteem is still low, I still am scared of physical confrontation, I still daydream, I still am an incompetent individual, my mindset hasn’t changed and I don’t feel like my life has gotten any better. 

I’ve come to many realization over these past couple of months like how you can only do your best at the end of day as outcomes are out of our control but I still worry. I also know that my self esteem should be based on my efforts/attempts but I still prioritize results over everything. 

I know things will happen as they will happen and there is no point in writing these scripts in my head but I still engage in this endless spiral of overthinking each and every single day.

I know having a significant other won’t solve my mental issues but I still shoot my shot with other women and get rejected. And we know what happens when I get rejected I get down for sometime.

I’m starting to reach the conclusion maybe I’m just not capable of becoming better. I think something is wrong with me to the point no therapy or self improvement will be able to fix the mess I am. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to love and respect myself.

Bad haircut stoicism,"I am as stoic as any one of you guys, but there is nothing stoicism can do to help me right now, in situations like these where it normally operates the most. 

I have my own movie premiere next week! Just now I got a haircut to fix the haircut I already got, that only made it worse. I look like a scruff. I hate it. Oh well, something to tell the grandkids. Not like it’s a leg or something, it’s only hair, it’ll grow back. I just loved how it looked before but it needed a slight bit of work, but it’s now fucked up. I don’t even hold my hair in this much regard, I’m not a person who generally holds this much care for his looks.

How does one cope knowing that there is so much injustice in the world?,Sometimes injustices keep me up at night knowing that a lot of times bad people get away with what they do to humans. I think often too that my abusers get to live life without facing repercussions of the extreme pain they caused me. It's hard knowing people can do bad things and not feel guilty about it. I feel like wanting to be a good person has caused me a lot of suffering but I refuse to do bad things.

You know, something’s happening, and then

Are Stoics allowed to have opinions?,"Are stoics allowed to have opinions and judgments? The Daily Stoic says no. Wouldn't that mean a lack of empathy or compassion? Wouldn't that lead to feeling no desire to change the world. Can Stoics even be activists? Can they work in politics? Because this would imply they couldn't because they don't feel that one opinion is better or worse than another. Or that they don't have one at all and don't stand for anything. Like if one person says we should take care of our own health care and someone else says we should have universal health care, and I think one is right and one is wrong, then am I being un-stoic because I have an opinion and that I judge one view as bad and one view as good? The Daily Stoic stuff I've been reading says that we should not have an opinion. Like am I not able to have the opinion that the holocaust was bad, and that I think that those who think the holocaust was good are wrong? Like, not having an opinion, not having a judgment is, basically like seeing someone getting robbed and not thinking that what happened was bad and that the robbers are not bad and that stealing isn't wrong. And that the man didn't have something bad or wrong happen to him. I'm new to stoicism and everybody keeps saying this and I'm confused. I am an activist and a lobbyist. I go to marches and organize events and wish to one day work in politics to help make the world better. When I see something that I think is wrong, that's my opinion. Is that wrong to have an opinion, to see something happen and deem it wrong or cruel or bad? How can someone even be without an opinion? That's like saying, how am I suppose to not think pizza is better than broccoli and that we should feed our school children pizza instead of broccoli? I understand that preference and opinion are to different things but still. And where does judgment come in? Are we not to judge things that we believe are bad? What does it even mean to jugde?

Anger out of and towards 'veganism'.,"Disclaimer: I have not studied veganism in much detail and cannot comment on whether 'anger' is a 'logical' consequence of following such philosophy. In this post I mean anger that people have out of and towards ideas that I roughly call 'veganism'. More on that below.

Dear fellow Students of Stoicism,

over time I hear increasing concern about the impact that humans have on the climate, on the system of life on Earth and about the way humans exploit other beings for their own material advantage. This is a bit of a controversial topic that can easily stimulate people to engage in 'destructive' dialogue. In line with this, I wish to share a few thoughts on the 'anger' and 'hate' that people cultivate regarding this topic.

Why do I write this post? I do not think that anger is a good thing: an ideal Stoic sage would not act out of anger, would he? Acting out of courage, a sense of justice, is not the same as acting out of anger, is it? Moreover, I do not like the concept of 'righteous anger'. I understand it, but do not like it. I think that virtue lies in *why* we make our decisions: specifically concepts as 'kindness', 'justice', 'courage', 'grace', 'forgiveness' and 'beauty' might be used to describe the beautiful intent of the sage that I admire.

Moreover, I do not think that ideal virtue aims at achieving external things for their own sake. In line with this, **I do not wish to force anyone to have specific views** on the matter of 'veganism' or the behaviour it entails. Instead, I wish to comment on the anger that I see coming from various regions on the spectrum of opinions. A few examples in this context:

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Understanding the 'hate' towards humans out of 'climate and animal concern'.** Here I mean 'hate' towards individual humans or the entirety of our species. In the context of the above, imagine a person 'hating' (many of) his fellow humans: imagine that his anger stems from pity for other beings that are being driven to (near) extinction through human conduct. Can we not understand that this person perceives this as unjust through his reverence for nature? *Is the perception of injustice not the best understandable reason for anger?*

In a similar example: can we not understand the 'anger' or resentment that someone might hold over the pain that is inflicted on animals in various industries? Is such anger at its core not a concern for the 'well-being' of other living things? If I may give a bit more of my personal opinion, I think that a human's 'concern' for beings other than himself is close to what I would call the best humanity has to offer.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Understanding the 'hate' towards 'vegans'.** Imagine someone feeling resentment towards 'vegans' or towards ideas such as 'veganism'. Imagine that this person believes that he needs to consume the way he does in order to support his 'well-being'. Can we in that case not understand that such a person feels fear because such ideas might (at some point in time) threaten his way of life?

Another aspect: can we not understand that people feel strong attachment to their (current) way of life, including their traditions? If people strongly propose ways of conduct that might hinder an individual's way of conduct, this can be perceived as 'something being taken away' from the individual. This in turn can be perceived as injustice. *Is the perception of injustice not the best understandable reason for anger?*

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus, since we are on-topic. **A note toward people who feel disheartened at the state of the world.** I agree that the human species is disrupting the system of life as we know it at a rapid rate. However, do not forget that we (or at least quite a few of us) humans are also trying to protect what life we may. It is not up to an individual to decide how everything turns out on a grand scale.

Ultimately, all life will end, no? What will it all have been 'good' for? Stoicism proposes that **virtue** is valuable for its own sake. I take the liberty to extend that also to our attempts at **virtue.** If you feel desperate, small and think that your impact on external things is so small that making any effort is not worthwhile, why not try to find value in the *attempt and struggle itself, remembering WHY you are making an effort?*

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Would an ideal Stoic not show clemency/forgiveness towards everyone, through his *understanding*? (Does not imply passivity.) Thank you for reading. Can you come up with related examples of anger/resentment that we may try to understand, such that we might progress a bit towards virtue?

Best regards

Losing hope in humanity,"I made a mistake in visiting r/Realpublicfreakout. The feeling of righteous indignation is infecting. Oh and the comments are even worse. I knew something was wrong watching these videos and it only made me think dumb and irrational these people are. It made me think that this world is beyond saving. The video of a man killing a mother and her three daughters on a car crash was the last straw and I knew I couldn't take it anymore. I knew these glimpses of tragedy is beyond my control. 

I very well knew that I'm human just like them. I'm flawed and fallable just like any of them, that is why I can't judge them or at least think low of them. We are all one and the same in this world.

An ode to our father god Zues the prime mover oh exhalted is thee above creation," Most glorious of immortals, Zeus  
The many named, almighty evermore,  
Nature's great Sovereign, ruling all by law  
Hail to thee! On thee 'tis meet and right  
That mortals everywhere should call.  
From thee was our begetting; ours alone  
Of all that live and move upon the earth  
The lot to bear God's likeness.  
Thee will I ever chant, thy power praise!  
For thee this whole vast cosmos, wheeling round  
The earth, obeys, and where thou leadest  
It follows, ruled willingly by thee.  
In thy unconquerable hands thou holdest fast,  
Ready prepared, that two-timed flaming blast,  
The ever-living thunderbolt:  
Nature's own stroke brings all things to their end.  
By it thou guidest aright the sense instinct  
Which spreads through all things, mingled even  
With stars in heaven, the great and small --  
Thou who art King supreme for evermore!  
Naught upon earth is wrought in thy despite, O God.  
Nor in the ethereal sphere aloft which ever winds  
About its pole, nor in the sea -- save only what  
The wicked work, in their strange madness,  
Yet even so, thou knowest to make the crooked straight.  
Prune all excess, give order to the orderless,  
For unto thee the unloved still is lovely--  
And thus in one all things are harmonized,  
The evil with the good, that so one Word  
Should be in all things everlastingly.  
One Word--which evermore the wicked flee!  
Ill-fated, hungering to possess the good  
They have no vision of God's universal law,  
Nor will they hear, though if obedient in mind  
They might obtain a noble life, true wealth.  
Instead they rush unthinking after ill:  
Some with a shameless zeal for fame,  
Others pursuing gain, disorderly;  
Still others folly, or pleasures of the flesh.  
\[But evils are their lot\] and other times  
Bring other harvests, all unsought--  
For all their great desire, its opposite!  
But, Zeus, thou giver of every gift,  
Who dwellest within the dark clouds, wielding still  
The flashing stroke of lightning, save, we pray,  
Thy children from this boundless misery.  
Scatter, O Father, the darkness from their souls,  
Grant them to find true understanding  
On which relying thou justly rulest all---  
While we, thus honoured, in turn will honour thee,  
Hymning thy works forever, as is meet  
For mortals while no greater right  
Belongs even to the gods than evermore  
Justly to praise the universal law!",Stoicism,1567191473.0,t3_cxl9dv,0.5,0
Is J. Cole a Stoic?,"I'm a big fan of Rap/Hip-hop, and it's easy to say that there are some conscientious rappers. Kendrick Lamar is an example. At the same time, almost 80% of what you hear is mostly talking about material success (which isn't necessarily negative). Being a follower of stoic thinking, I find most of these bling rap songs annoying because most of what they talk about aren't relatable.

Recently, I've dived heavily into J. Cole's discography and, I can't believe I haven't done it sooner. He seems like a down to earth dude who knows his own limits. This verse in Middle child really paints a picture of someone who really doesn't care what other people think: 

""The Bentley is dirty

My sneakers is dirty

But that's how I like it

You all on my dick""

&#x200B;

Then, when he's on the topic of why he would ever engage in a rap battle, he says some real shit:

&#x200B;

""It won't be 'cause my shit ain't selling the same

It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers

It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane

Everything grows

It's destined to change."" 

&#x200B;

When I listen to this verse, I instantly thought about Marcus Aurelius's Meditations. It may seem like a stretch, but I feel J. Cole embodies a lot of the principles Marcus speaks about. Many Stoic practiced going without luxurious items to remind themselves of humility. Cato the Younger would even dress in plain garbs to remind himself of stoic philosophy (kind of like how J. Cole wears basic clothing). It may just be me, but it's crazy that even though Stoicism started thousands of years ago, it's ideas live on even in today's celebrities even if unknowingly.",Stoicism,1566254303.0,t3_csong0,0.5,0

How to improve as a person when I just want to die ?,"

Stoicism - Should I be single or be in a relationship? How Can I apply Stoicism to my thinking here,"I made the decision to have a relationship break with my girlfriend (of 3 years) 6 months ago due to my petty desires and I did not want to do wrong by her. The break was my choice and it is not my girlfriends fault as she is an amazing person, emotionally mature and so easy to be with. She never pushed or rushed anything which I think is one of the main reasons I ended up naturally flowing into an exclusive relationship.  
Before I met my girlfriend I was dating multiple women and used to enjoy it. I having been battling the urges for a some time now and even though I had a good sex life with my girlfriend I could not stop wanting to be back out dating and having causal sex. I get a lot of attention when I go out which does not help the situation when I am trying to not make the wrong choices.

I have been following/practising Stoicism for a 4 months and although I am still very new to the philosophy  it has helped my life tremendously. I find the practise/application of Stoicism very easy when it comes to the other areas in my life even in times of stress but I cannot/do not know how to apply it in this area of my life. I am aware that I am letting desire control me and that this is stupid.

I am at a crossroads now where I want to make a decision. I would really appreciate any insight/wisdom anyone can share and how I can apply Stoic teachings to either help me make the right choice or to have a different viewpoint on how I am currently thinking.

My (f17) best friend (f17) won't talk to me because a guy chose me over her.,"Fist off, I know I messed up. I know I am in the wrong. I just want stoic advice on how to move on what to do next. 

Everyone in this story is 17. So me and my friend (I'll call her Emily) both know this guy (I'll him Ian). Emily and Ian have known each other for a while and I just started hanging out with them at the end of April. Emily used to have a crush on Ian but she told me she was over it when we all started hanging out.

When we hung out for the first time me and Ian both smoked weed and I got really horny and attracted to him. Weed usually does this to me so I figured it was just that and brushed it off the next day. Ian also said that he was talking to this girl he really liked so there was no point in me pursuing anything. The next day, Emily could not stop telling me that she thought I had a crush on Ian and was being really annoying about how obvious it was that I was eye fucking him when we hung out. THis really annoyed me but at the end of the day my feelings for him weren't resolved. She also kept trying to tell me that he liked me too but I thought she was just making stuff up so I didn't take her seriously.

Then a month later, I realized that I did have a HUGE crush on him because every time I saw him and spoke to him I would blush and get really embarrassed. So I told her, and she told me that I should absolutely go for it. She even said that he has been talking about how much he likes me for months even before we all hung out. This obviously made me very happy, but then last minute she tells me that she used to have a really big crush on him too but that she's over it now and gave me the green light to be with him. She also warned me that he may be exclusive with the girl he was talking about a month ago. I figured I wouldn't pursue him unless anything changes.

Fast forward to last week, I had them both over to my house and we had a few beers. His tolerance is crazy low because he has a history of drug abuse, so he got REALLY drunk super quick. One thing led to another and we're all on my bed and his head is on my stomach. Things got super weird. I didn't know if he was in a relationship and he wouldn't' t be upfront about it and every-time we got up to go outside or something him and Emily would whisper to each other. I remember I kept asking him to get off of me because I didn't want to be involved in his cheating but he wouldn't and would just climb on me more. Emily also kept leaving the room to go upstairs and was leaving us both alone. When me and Ian were alone I kept making stupid drunk conversation because I didn't think I could kiss him or make a move because he was in a relationship. And I was also getting upset about him and Emily whispering about me because I thought they were talking shit and I was feeling really insecure. Emily also kept texting me that she wanted to leave and walk home (she lived over a mile away and it was 1am so I told her to just stay). I eventually had to kick them out of my house because my dad would lose his mind if he found out a guy slept over.

The next day Emily calls me to debrief and tells me that he kept telling her to leave us alone so we can make-out and that he was fighting the urge the whole night. The only reason why he didn't want because of his relationship with this other girl. Then a few hours later Emily tells me that she needs space. I send her a long apology saying I'm sorry that she was in the middle of this whole thing and she responds saying that she still needs space. A few days later I call her and basically tell her it's not fair for her to cut me off just because this guy likes me, and that it's not my fault he wanted me. I also listened to her feelings and made sure to apologize for invalidating anything she felt. She then tell me that she still likes him which is why the whole situation sucks.

This is my best friend. Obviously I don't want to fight with Emily and I want to apologize, but she's mad at me for something that was out of my control. She told me it was ok to pursue him and then stopped talking to me when I did. What do I do?",Stoicism,1655353227.0,t3_vddcy9,0.43,0

Being powerful is answer to resentment and anger,"If a child or a homelsss person calls you names you would likely not get angry because you know that you are much more powerful than the child or homeless person. If your boss or your Professor unfairly criticizes you you are much more likely to feel angry because you don't have power over them. Resentment is caused by powerlessness more than the harm itself. So the solution lies in becoming powerful and improving yourself.

 As long as your inner self knows that
- you are improving, 
- are on path of becoming powerful,
- or are actively working towards removing your insecurity 

resentment will stay under control. Resentment is literally saying to you ""be powerful so that you do not need to not take revenge"".",Stoicism,1661576472.0,t3_wyu3v7,0.61,8

How do I deal with the hate of being a woman?,"I'm straight and attracted to men. But I wish I was born as a male. I hate being a straight woman.

I hate that I want kids. I hate that I have a limited number of years to be able to be pregnant without significant risk of complications due to postponed pregnancy. Therefore, I also have a limited number of years to find a partner who I am in love with and at the same time, want to have children before I go infertile. I hate that I feel like I have to rush dating because of this.

I hate that most birth control options are geared toward women and at the same time, have negatively affected the long-term health of many women. I hate that I'm mostly the one who will carry the consequences of an unplanned pregnancy. And abortion is freaking illegal in my country. And on top of that, the abortion mortality rate in my country is so high. I hate that I have to choose between possibly damaging my health due to birth control, possibly dying from abortion, stressing out because of doing something illegal (abortion), or possibly ruining my career plans because of an unplanned pregnancy.

I hate being a woman! Especially in my country!

I don't know how to think of these more healthily.

EDIT: I'm very sorry for this post sounding dismissive of men's problems. It's a mistake on my part. I think that raising children just became very important to me (I'm in my early 20s) to the point that I felt like I don't care about other aspects of life. I do sound like I am trying to avoid pregnancy (even if I'm saying I want kids) but in my defense, it's because I do not think I'm mentally, physically, and financially ready for it yet.",Stoicism,1670831126.0,t3_zjrn9a,0.74,351

"Is age regression as a man with ADD, GAD and infantile autism a problem?","Hey i have a lot og diagnostics, these 3. I combatted a lot of these with talking 5 min cold showers daily everyday in morning, I also try to run 3 kilometres everyday. I try to go to bed at 11 pm and wake up at 7 am. I drink coffee daily before 12 am, I also take ADD medication and anxiety medication. I write gratitude journal daily, as well as notes and I try to build on myself by doing various activities. Like reading, going to Gym, breathing exercises and more.

I still have addictions, I feel hyper sexual so i masturbait daily. I play computer a lot and I work as much as possible. I love working but my job, isn’t something that I can do daily. Because it’s sort of like a company that finds jobs for me where I can work, and if they need me I’ll be there.

But I also find that I tend to get more addicted to things, I constantly have tendencies of seeing myself as a man child even though I have been told I’m very mature. I seek attention, and I have over reactions and I worry a lot.

I feel like I can’t get out of this rut that I am in, I finished gymnasium. But idk, I feel like I’m inadequate and that I cannot be a man. Like all of my actions have been for nothing, I overcame depression and I finished gymnasium despite having undiagnosed ADHD, anxiety, depression and infantile autism.

Yet I feel like I never accomplished anything, I know I’m not nothing and I know that I’m valuable. But I constantly feel like I have no value, like no one think I’m anything but a mistake. I feel like I can’t be a man, almost like I never had a chance. I know I can do anything and that I can’t stay resilient through pain and suffering, stay composed and be a leader. But I’m constantly being reminded that I’m less valuable than people who haven’t accomplished anything. Idk why I believe that, but what can I do?

"Why are we certain that death is inevitable? (Bionics, mind uploading, or other sci-fi solutions)","Stoicism largely builds on the foundation of death being an inevitable thing. Even if you somehow avoid any external cause of death (murders, accidents, diseases, etc.), old age will still inevitably get you, so there is no point in fearing death.

However, science and technology progress at an incredible speed. So, I don't see any reason why some kind of brain cloning, or mind uploading, or bionics, or some other random futuristic concept that would allow humans to have theoretically unlimited lifespans (at least in terms of aging), couldn't eventually become a reality.

You may argue that the idea of immortality always has been plaguing humans' minds, with the ideas of the philosopher's stone, and similar. Smart people laughed at these ideas, and they were right. And I agree, these were stupid ideas. However, keep in mind that there is some bias to being a pessimist: you are either right or positively surprised. I am nearly certain that every existing modern technology would be considered to be impossible by people of the past. So, being skeptical of something doesn't mean that it is impossible. And I am not aware of anything that would rule out the possibility of overcoming aging with technological solutions (aside from the theories that claim that the universe will eventually die, like the heat death theory, but they all are very speculative theories).

So, why are we certain that the death is an absolute certainty? What if it isn't? What if there is even a veeeery tiny chance that we can eventually overcome aging due to technology? What if such technology could become possible within a reasonable amount of time? Why shouldn't we crawl into the deepest safest hole trying to maximize our survival rate in the hope of surviving until the technology becomes available? And then, once aging is overcome, develop a strategy for avoiding death indefinitely (clones, mind backups, interstellar travel, spreading across the universe, etc.).",Stoicism,1698172872.0,t3_17fjyiy,0.42,0

"Social media toxicity, R/vegan, and what should I do.","So I am recently new to Reddit, again. I was on reddit back in  2012 to 2014, but stopped until this year. I like how Reddit is mostly more positive, especially compared to the toxicity of Facebook. 
I have found great communities from books, dogs, satellite radio fans, to philosophy.
But something recently left a bad taste in my mouth. I am vegetarian and try mostly for a vegan diet due to my morality with animals. Not preaching this is just my personal beliefs, but I feel this is important information for the story.
So anyways I also joined R/vegan.
I posted a few times on the subreddit and recently I posted an article entitled ""Veganism is in crisis, and the fanatics can only blame themselves"" and asked what the people what they thought of the criticism. Just because I was curious. I did not write the article.
But I would say about 40% to 45% started to attack me personally or my online persona I guess.
I like to think I have tuff skin and shit posters and trolls don't bother me, but this time it kind of did.
I was just asking what people thoughts were and to start a discussion. I didn't give my opinion of the article and I have been posting on the board for awhile. 
But almost half of them seemed mad at me, I tried to defend myself, but they didn't seem to care. After a few responses I realized I was just wasting my time and deleted my post and blocked a few people. 
I had my wife look at the post and she says it did not look offensive or anything like that, but I do admit she could be biased.
I was really starting to like Reddit with the discussions. But R/vegan makes me question if I should give up social media in general. I don't know. 
I like the discussions, but I am getting to old to deal with shit posters all the time. I am not sure if this was a one time fluke, a vegan thing (I am not unrealistic, I know how they can be sometimes), a reddit thing, or just people...

I've been taking my true friends for granted and kinda abandoned them to chase the possibility of someone else," 

Recently I caught myself falling for a girl that I realistically could never have because she was already dating someone. 

We got along super well, we hung out a lot , we talked a bunch, but in the end shes taken and I respect that. I learned a lot about myself during the few months I had with her but she moved away and now its over.

I never even really tried to push for a romantic relationship I just wish we were closer friends but it is what it is. 

Logically I understood the situation and fallout but emotionally I couldn't prevent myself from causing my own heart break.

I also realized that during these few months I was somewhat ignoring my close friends, the people that I already had deep connections and history with and the people that really care for me. 

And weirdly I don't know why but It doesn't feel enough... 

For some reason my brain seems to think the one thing I cant have is more important to the things I already have. Again, logically it makes sense. But emotionally it doesn't. I cant help but take those I have for granted and instead waste my time on something I don't have, on something that MIGHT be a POSSIBILITY... 

I feel shitty because I did kinda upset those that cared for me. I feel shitty because I couldn't get what I wanted with her. And I feel shitty because now what I do have doesn't seem as good or powerful as what I could have had with her.",Stoicism,1698566232.0,t3_17iy2wk,0.54,1
Is there a darkness to Stoicism in regards to Roman society?,"My interest in Stoicism started a couple of years ago during a period where I was going through a difficult situation which I am born into. Reading the Enchiridion really helped me and since then I have tried to practice Stoicism. It has helped me very much and I have kept reading Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius. 

Especially one message from Enchiridion has helped me. It goes along the lines that life is a play and you are given a role, you are not the author nor the director and you can only play the role your  give as best you can. 

Life was of course difficult in ancient Rome, even for the wealthy, and I can imagine that the reasoning above would help people cope with hardships. But considering that around 5-10% of Rome's population were slaves the ""be happy with your lot""-message, although helpful to the individual, appears to me that it could be an instrument of oppression. So, was Stoicism the ideology of the Romans?

I also want to add that even though a society has an ideology the actions of it's leaders and institutions must of course not align with that ideology. Something which is apparent through history. Just look at all the countries with the term ""democratic"" in their names. So even if there is a lot of good in Stoicism, the fact that it comes from such an imperial society makes me doubt it. 

Additionally the actions of stoic philosophers like Marcus Aurelius and Seneca also makes me doubt Stoicism somewhat. I mean Marcus Aurelius was in charge of an empire that went to war regularly and persecuted religious minorities.  Seneca was a shrewd politician and a businessman which also puts me off. 

I also want to be clear that we cannot and should not judge people and societies through the lens of our modern values. Everything evolves and progresses, so too values. I am not judging, I am just questioning if it is good to adopt their ideology, or philosophy if you prefer that term.  

In conclusion, because of these thoughts I have gone from being completely positive towards Stoicism and seeing it as the answer to life, to being more sceptical. 

I'd love to hear the thoughts of this insightful community. ",Stoicism,1697720200.0,t3_17bihwu,0.5,0

Meditating on Ukraine-Russia war a bit,"Hello everyone, things are horrible right now and I am sorry for being one of the posts to touch on this crises that reminds the atrocities that are being done by the Russian-Kremlin-USSR forces. 

I want to begin by saying that I am taking a side against Russia and its forces that are committing uncalled war on Ukraine and the rest of Europe. There is no question as to who is the aggressor, but what was right in the past or present, I am not taking that side. Just against Russia as many significant historical events and current geopolitical tensions are out of my reach to discuss. I believe the same goes for 99% of redditors, so please have a breadth of thought and Yutori in your thinking before you call my mistakes or others’ that currently does not matter at this point. 

I want our western allies and the people who are against Russian invasion to look more deeply into the fall of USSR. More specifically, understand and familiarize yourself with why USSR fell. Not to make any judgments, just familiarize and drench yourself in what had happened. What forces were at play and who were the originators. 

I found the autobiography of Gorbachev to be the answer. How he grew up, where he grew up, who held control, what people stood up against, and why. This will give us the right feeling of unification among people who are against Russian invasion and strategic plans for the future. 

I believe that by as stoically as we can, understanding from within through the eyes of Gorbachev, we will see and understand what Russia truly is. We need to identify the true aggressors and condemn them, but not Russia itself. Because of mass misunderstanding of what Russia was and is, there hasn’t been a development in the right direction at all. There can be no war if everyone actually understood everything fully in its entirety. We didn’t before, and we are paying for this orchestra that we did not pay for: today. 

Let us analyze everything in its entirety. Again, the way Gorbachev saw the world, let us try to see that world through his eyes and make judgments that are called for today. Not judgments of mass hysteria nor reactions to misconducts that were looming to arrive in the past few decades. We can end it if can understand it fully. And if we can understand it fully, we can push this knowledge to take its rightful stage. 

Let’s uncover Russian lamentation done by the USSR for the past century and make this a common knowledge that people have tried and failed what Putin is trying to achieve for the past hundreds of years done by rulers and dictators.

A free world cannot be recognized without the existence of bondage. Let us recognize the originator, what is constricting us? Why do we feel the need to be free? Because we’re all bondages one way or another right? 

Time and time again I’ve seen Stoics break their bondages because what we truly value is something we already have. We just don’t like losing it. The time has come for someone to take that from you whether you know you have what you want or not. Time for our minds to unite and break this enigma of rampant misinformation and forced ignorance done by powers looking to steal what you already have. 

Let’s expose everything with our minds. We can help. We can do something. I do not know for sure but understanding seems to be the first. 

I am going to be honest with you, I’m not even 1/4th done with the autobiography I’m asking people to read. It was just that insightful in its first hundred pages during this current times. I don’t know how it ends nor what its true message is. Yet, I still believe.

Responsible concealed carry: how stoicism helps,"Hey all,
I don't usually post, but today I noticed an important way stoicism has helped me daily. I just recently turned 20, and living in Idaho, I can legally concealed carry a firearm anywhere in the state. I do this for self defense and to defend those around me. When carrying a firearm, you have to be especially careful with your temperament and be able to effectively defuse situations. Drawing my gun is something I hope I'll never have to do, and it's an absolute last resort. Stoicism has helped me stay calm in almost any situation, even just in everyday life. I used to let emotional distress take control of me when I was younger. Ever since I've taken on the stoic mindset, I have been calm and collected 100% of the time, no exceptions. I only started carrying a firearm recently and I think it's an absolute necessity to be calm at all times while doing so. Even without drawing it, if there's a heated (nonviolent) disagreement in public, it certainly isn't good to also be armed in case the police get involved.

Gun owners: understand that you must be calm at all times while armed. Stoicism is the way.

Need help resolving anger towards repeated stupidity committed by my wife.,"So it's 4:23am for me right now. I have a final exam on quantum mechanics tomorrow, and I can't fall back to sleep because a fan in the bathroom fell down 2 hours ago. Why would a fan fall down you ask? Well, there's been smoke smell coming into the bathroom of our apartment. After trying everything to no avail, I decided to just seal the fan with duct tapes and it worked. The smoke smell stopped. But then my genius wife still kept turning on the sealed fan for the past few weeks, despite me telling her that it makes no sense. So tonight, once again, her stupidity culminated to waking me up the night before my super important exam. (After I was so very careful with my sleeping schedule for the past few months or so no less.)

Well, maybe now you're thinking that it's probably not a big deal. People make mistakes...well, my wife here just could not understand how to keep the printer ink stocked no matter how many times I try to teach her, keeps locking herself out for 7 times in a row, drops her phone into the toilet and having to pay for repair multiple times...these examples are just the tip of the iceberg...would take too long to list all of her blunders...though some of them are actually kind of funny. Anyways, you get the gist.

So right now I'm just like at the end of my rope here. Trying to act stoic and push down my anger. Still, it's just so very hard. This time I actually did not yell at her when it happened and calmly fixed the fan again. So there's progress, but seriously, thoughts of getting a divorce in the future still linger in my mind...Are there any stoic advice on something like this? I honestly could use some guidance on anger.",Stoicism,1607247421.0,t3_k7quem,0.57,2

Ryan holiday and taxes,"Hi,

I'm sure most of you are familiar with Ryan Holiday and the impact he's had on introducing us to Stoicism. I'm thankful for that.

On that note there are two things that lead me to believe this guy is a shill and only promotes stoicism for financial reasons. 

The first is how he put up a post on his Instagram about how to be thankful/accepting of taxes. This is dangerous territory. I'm generalizing here but I'm sure most of us feel we are taxed way to much. I feel like hes saying it's okay the government takes this much money from us, it's what is and we should just deal with it. 

The second, on his Instagram pages he occasionally puts up images of him giving the bird to statues in the south. For some reason this really stuck with me. What's your take? 

Thirdly, I cant stand how the guy sells us a coin to promote stoicism.  it just doesnt feel right.

Stoics Do Care about Social Justice: A Response to Irvine,"> Any speech extolling the merits of inner peace and apatheia goes wrong—and in fact becomes positively toxic—the moment that the audience begins to suspect that our school advocates for *complacency* in the face of social injustice...

> Of course, Stoicism teaches no such thing! To the contrary, we believe that no man or woman can be moral (or Happy) unless they work tirelessly for the benefit of all humanity.

Stoic view on having a fwb?,"I (24M) was at a party last week bumped into a 22F who I dated for a few months a couple of years ago. We hit it off and things happened. Spoke on the phone a few nights later and I asked her on a date but she said she wasn’t looking for anything serious right now and turned me down. But she said that she’s interested in fwb if I was. I said I’d think about it, and later texted and invited her over the next night. She came over, we spoke about ground rules, kissed and then we had sex. It was great and we’re seeing each other next week to do it again.

Now I’m feeling emotionally conflicted. I used to have feelings for this girl, and I still might. We have amazing sexual chemistry and we live fairly close to each other. Am I just punishing myself long-term if I go through with this? Or do I just go through with it and damn the consequences?

How do I not care about offensive jokes people make in uni?,"(21 F) It’s my first year in uni and I would say I’m a really social person.

So I met this one guy who was with a girl and they’re both really friendly. This guy and I come from the same country in North Africa and have been making a lot of jokes at each other in a light manner until until he started going after my appearance by saying my forehead was big and saying I have “googly eyes” (for wearing glasses) even though we both wear glasses and have big foreheads. I just laughed it off but him and the girl could tell I was affected by it so they said I was laughing in pain and he apologized. I told him I didn’t care and he was like “the insults I just told you were the tip of the ice berg, I could go more but I won’t do that” I could’ve insulted him for having acne but I’m not that type of person. 

I really want to learn how to stop taking these jokes seriously especially targeted at appearance but I don’t know how.

Sexual history,"What are stoicism’s thoughts on judging a partner on his or her sexual history. 

My friends with benefits relationship has turned to a committed relationship as of recently. 

I recognise this relationship has comparatively poor foundation since till some time it has been based on pure physical intimacy. 

But we have fallen in love and I feel the change in our relationship from just lust to lust and love. 

I am however concerned with her sexual past. 

She has had one fling in the past which is bothering me.

She had this fling to get over me since i had a fling too, i was an asshole to her which i have changed since then.

The reason it’s bothering me are the following . 

I will dive deep and be completely honest about what they are.

I am afraid as she has done it once she might cheat on me.


It’s an irrational thought but it is there. 

I guess it has to do with my upbringing and beliefs. 

I am actively trying to challenge this feeling so that it is replaced or atleast accompanied by another realistic one. 

She has not cheated on her one bf she had. 

It is my insecurity and has nothing to do with her but still I genuinely fear that a girl with a history of fling is a risk. 

My lack of sexual experience might have to do something with this insecurity 

It would help to surround myself with some open minded people but sadly people around here don’t talk much about this stuff since it’s considered a taboo to talk about sex. Therefore I feel alone in feeling this , like I am the only one having these doubts and thoughts.

Would Stoic kill Hitler?,"I know the title is a bit controversial, so let me explain.

We believe there are no bad or good people, just those who follow Nature and those who do things on external influences and bad judgments, thus not following Nature and not fulfilling their potential. 

Killing someone is also not a very Stoic thing *per se* \- how can taking someone's life make me virtuous? And if I believe there are no bad or good people with killing someone (that would outside of Stoic circles be considered ""bad"") I essentially stop that person from potentially fulfilling their potential and giving up bad judgments, and aligning himself with Nature.

BUT - then again what greatly differentiates Stoic from Sceptic is that we believe we must do things that are not only making us virtuous but also making our surroundings a better place. We don't run from society, we want to make society as a whole a better place.

&#x200B;

So that brings me to Hitler part - is it a Stoic way to kill someone that is affecting the lives of so many people, whose bad judgments are resulting in the death of other people and thus his actions are essentially preventing others (in this case millions) from following their Nature, their Virtue (being taking their lives, or affecting someone who finds no virtue in killing someone in a way that he must join the army and kill other men that he have no reason to). 

On one hand, is it not in my power to decide how and what some dictator will do, but on the other hand, if there was an opportunity for me to end the suffering of society and millions of people by killing a dictator then making society a better place IS IN THAT CASE IN MY POWER.

The Ten Equations That Rule The World,"I just finished fascinating audiobook called ""The Ten Equations That Rule The World"" by David Sumpter, and I wanted to share it with you all. While it may not be directly related to Stoicism, I found some interesting parallels between the mathematical principles discussed in the book and our Stoic philosophy.

Stoicism teaches us to cultivate virtues like wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance, enabling us to navigate life's challenges and achieve inner peace. Similarly, this book explores ten equations that provide mathematical frameworks for understanding different aspects of our world.

By delving into these equations, the author sheds light on fundamental principles that govern areas such as economics, population dynamics, quantum mechanics, and more. While this may seem far from our usual Stoic discussions, I found that the analytical and systematic approach presented in the book resonated with our philosophy.

Stoicism encourages critical thinking, self-reflection, and the pursuit of knowledge. ""The Ten Equations That Rule The World"" offers a similar intellectual journey, inviting us to explore the underlying truths and patterns that shape our reality.

By engaging with these mathematical concepts, we can sharpen our analytical skills, expand our understanding of the world, and develop a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of all things – a perspective that aligns with Stoic principles.

So, if you're interested in exploring the intersection of mathematics, science, and philosophy, I highly recommend giving ""The Ten Equations That Rule The World"" a read. It's an enlightening journey that may provide fresh insights and complement our Stoic practices.

Stay curious and keep cultivating those virtues, my fellow Stoics!",Stoicism,1684458449.0,t3_13lgo29,0.6,4
I fumbled a 10/10,"My story is tragic, I just can't get over it. Let me tell you. There's this girl at school and I've had a crush on her for 2 years now. For 1 year, I tried to exchange some glances with her, passing by her in the hallways and finding her extremely beautiful. She never looked at me, it seemed like she didn't notice me. 

I have a certain amount of self-esteem and I don't want to force anything anyway, so I tried to forget about her. So after the first whole year of trying to exchange glances, I finally stopped and for another year, I moved on and almost forgot about her. However, a month ago, I don't know why or how, but she started looking at me with what seemed like passion, every day. 

At first, I thought I was imagining it and didn't pay her any attention, but it became more and more obvious. Nevertheless, I decided not to do anything, so I didn't go talk to her, but one day we took the same bus and she just stared at me the whole way. When I got off the bus, I started walking towards my house, and then I heard footsteps behind me and felt a tap on my shoulder. I turned around and it was the girl in question. She literally asked me for my number. I couldn't believe it, so I acted in probably the worst way a human being can react. 

I had my headphones on and pretended not to hear her. I just continued on my way without even responding to her or looking her in the eye, even though she had the courage to come up to me, a courage that I never had. I don't know how she took it, but I really messed up. I was scared, and that fear betrayed me. Maybe I deserve it, probably. What's really sad is that for some external reason, maybe for professional or family reasons, I don't know, she left school a week ago.

Perception,"Have you seen the clip of a woman disappearing behind Scarlett Johansson?

The woman doesn’t disappear. I took a screen shot of the clip. The circle is the cloth of the woman’s dress splaying past Johansson’s arm.

In my personal dictionary, this clip is the definition of ‘Perception’. Let’s throw out the idea the video is edited. I’m taking to a bigger idea.

The camera’s angle creates the illusion. Your viewpoint is REALLY important. Your current location is the the only way you know how to see and experience life.

Stoicism helps me see reality from a very intimate and personal viewpoint. It’s a
tool that locks my camera’s angle in place.

God’s Love & Meaningful Suffering,"The two main points of life are to love and to suffer. This is symbolic in Jesus’s journey. 

Jesus loved us in a way that only God could. Jesus suffered for us in a way that only God could. Jesus conquered death. The wage of sin is death. Jesus conquered sin. His suffering allowed God’s Love, the blood of Christ, to wash over us. 

Suffering is inevitable on earth. Living by sin leads to empty &amp;amp; meaningless suffering. God’s love is the only true salvation from this suffering. Though we will still suffer, internalizing his love is all we need to fully love &amp;amp; accept ourselves and our situations. When that happens, the acceptance and love shines like a light for others. 

No short term desires compare to a relationship with God. It’s not about being perfect. The right things do themselves when fully conscious of God’s love and presence. Even if the right thing causes more suffering, God’s love will triumph over any suffering as you surrender to a full consciousness of him. Why turn from him and suffer meaninglessly on your own selfish accord?",Stoicism,1530255743.0,t3_8ur4pv,0.45,0

"""If you are unhappy, it is your fault"" - I made a community where you can practice optimism","> **If you are unhappy, it is your fault**

> You and only you can make you happy. Other people and other things cannot make you happy, but you can find happiness through their medium. Wood does not make one happy, but cutting, sanding, and assembling wood into a piece of art or furniture can bring happiness through the actions you take with it. Inversely, you cannot, and should not expect to, make others happy. It is their responsibility to find happiness through the actions they take with you.

When it comes to practice, this is far from easy. 

So I made a community/online space where I and others can practice optimism to fasten the change in our perspective.

Actions against terrorism.,"So terrorism is caused largely, nowadays by Islamic extremists. Cato of Utica took up arms against Caesar because he felt that having Caesar in power would be detrimental to the freedom of Rome.
Marcus Aurelius conducted numerous military campaigns in old Europe. Even Socrates was a war hero before he became the father of western philosophy.

Serious question now; Should we do the same?
Islamic extremists threatens the stability of the western civilization. They knowingly and tactically use our freedoms against us. 

I believe as stoics dedicated to a cosmopolitan world, we are tasked with doing all in our power to change this (if nothing else prevents us) although of course, we should be indifferent to the outcome (death, exile, torture etc). Either that, or we should merge the collapse of western civilization and our own painful deaths into our personal premeditation of adversity practices.

"Women are not capable of ""extreme leadership"" due to being ""more emotional and irrational""? I find this questionable.","[https://youtube.com/shorts/XzB8nqFM61g?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/XzB8nqFM61g?feature=share)

I came across this, watched it out of morbid curiosity, and found it baffling. I also argued with one commenter about famous female leaders. In short (and from what I can remember), he argued about how the most beloved either defaulted to their ruling husbands; single rulers not striving for proper successors; and those such as Margaret Thatcher waging war on sovereign nations over small gains. He also spouted that female brains cannot overcome the innate differences they have from men such as being ""more prone to shouting and crying"".

I argued that many women are capable of controlling their emotions (in fact, the image I have seen with associated with mature femininity is a sagely and dignified lady no matter how tense a situation is) and that countless male rulers were/are just as guilty of petty and immature deeds. (And what I find richly ironic is that the commenter said he was from Russia, where the women there are ""more mature than American women but still pale to Russian men"". Meanwhile, his male ruler is waging war that he's struggling with but is too stubborn to cut his losses)

I just don't get where people get the idea of women being less emotionally stable and incapable of leading in tense situations.

I apologize for this odd post. I just wanted to share and get insight on this matter.

This means a Stoic can, in good faith, label the loss of Roe being applied in all 50 states as an injustice or one could view abortion as an injustice.

This is incorrect insofar as I have read. It enjoins practitioners to define their own ideas of virtue, justice, etc. wo specific ideas of what those are in the absolute and places the burden on the individual to figure out what each means to their self and then implement w absolute fidelity (or as close as one can) and to be patient w those who differ in their lack of ability to do the same.

It is not their words that hurt you, it is your reaction to them.  If you decide to not be injured, you are not injured.

Stoicism comes dangerously close to nihilism,"I recently read the Practicing Stoic, which encouraged me to revisit Meditations and the writings of Seneca. As an atheist, Stoicism appeals to me as a way to check my own beliefs and thoughts. And honestly, that's one thing I miss about religion.

Yet, I also think that a partial adherence to stoic teachings could lead to bad outcomes. Specifically, the teachings on detachment and death, and treating  others how you wish to be treated. I've always took issue  with the ""golden rule,"" because many people treat themselves like shit and allow others to treat them poorly as well.

Take for example, Achilles in the Iliad. Achilles knows that he will die in Troy, and he accepts his impending death with stoic detachment. He brings this up when a soldier begs him to spare  his life. Achilles has no problem killing the unarmed, begging soldier, because he knows he himself will soon meet the same fate. (Of course, he is very un-stoic in his whining and attachment to Patroculus) 

I also see this in more tragic circumstances, like Columbine. One part of that horrific event that really stuck with me was right before the pair committed suicide, they stopped shooting at students. They may have suddenly developed a conscience, but I dont think so. I think they more likely grew bored with  it all, and that they remained detached through the entire ordeal. I think their detachment and acceptance of their own impending doom allowed to them to commit these atrocities. Like Achilles (not in  the heroic sense, of course), they aren't phased by victims pleading for their lives. They will soon blow their own brains out, so it's no big deal to them. 

All of this to say, while I love the Practicing Stoic Handbook, my biggest gripe with it is that it starts with Stoic detachment to pleasure,opinions, etc., and doesnt address Virtue until nearly the end of the book. I find this irresponsible. I would encourage anyone who wishes to study stoicism to first study virtues like courage, honor, and humility before tackling detachment. Detachment without virtue is dangerous, in my opinion.",Stoicism,1634250109.0,t3_q8a2dg,0.7,72
Stoicism & Polyamory/Non-Monogamy,"Let me start by saying that I love this community, it has really been incredibly helpful while studying and practicing stoicism in my life. So first, let me say thank you all for your wisdom!
But I’ll be honest, I’m a little disheartened and kind of surprised by some of the discussions here in response to the Will Smith/Chris Rock incident last night, but what concerned me are the attacks at Will/Jada’s relationship style instead of the action itself. 

There is a lot of hate/judgment being thrown around regarding Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith’s alleged open marriage. Many are (negatively) calling him a cuck, emasculated, etc. which I don’t think is fair and I definitely don’t think is accurate (if anything, it makes him stronger than someone who can’t handle hearing their girlfriend thinks Chris Evans is hot). I also find it confusing how anyone who is practicing or even interested in stoicism would feel compelled to judge a man who - to my knowledge - is not a practicing stoic. People are gonna people and all we can do is care for our own little patch of grass, no one else is our business. 

We live in a society where we are socialized to believe that after we meet someone we even remotely like we need to only have eyes for them - and we can’t even acknowledge to our partner that we think the waiter/waitress is attractive. Biologically, we are not wired for monogamy. But for some reason (most likely religion), monogamy is considered normal/the default people enter into instead of doing it with intent and consciousness. That being said, I personally identify as polyamorous, but I do not advocate/am not advocating for anyone to open up their relationships without direct, conscious intention - many open up in response to something (cheating, boredom, to fix their marriage, etc.) which is foolish and a bandaid that rarely works. 

Practicing stoicism next to polyamory has helped me unlearn so many toxic ideals about what love between two people can be. It’s helped me process my feelings of inadequacy and jealousy when my partner is with someone else. I put far less pressure on my partner to be everything for me (best friend, lover, etc.) and rely more on myself as I realize I’m all I’m in control of. All of this to say, I just think it’s important and my obligation to give at least a little bit of the other side of the coin as I haven’t found much of the pro-non-monogamy side on this page. 

In posting this, I realize that I am making my own judgments about you and your ideals, and for that I apologize. Know that that is not my intention.

How to manage stress in gaming (and in general)?,"I'm a young man getting slowly into stoicism.

I like playin a lot of dynamic, stressful games like e.g. ULTRAKILL. I think im playing rationally - trying some tactics, doing stuff to manage problems (prioritizing enemies, defending yourself etc.). Nontheless tend to feel a lot of stress. At first i was still raging, hitting my desk, but today i felt a bit of a progress - i was still very stressed, i sometimes felt angry, however i remained calm and ""took a deep breath"" and went ahead. It might be also be caused by the fact i'm at my grandma and i don't want to make noise.

The issues I had trying to apply stoic principles,"This year I started my stoic journey and I've been enjoying it so far. I feel better overall, but the thing I like the most about stoicism is that I have guidance or some sort of ""framework"" on how to behave on any given situation, which facilitates making tough decisions.

One issue I struggled with for some time is knowing what would be ""the stoic way"" to handle certain scenarios I faced in my life. And this was an issue for two reasons:

1. I would have to search for a specific teaching/quote/insight on stoic books that would relate to the situation I'm going through. This is not easy since most stoic books (at least the most popular ones) aren't structured in an organized way. They're mostly just a bunch of teachings with no particular order or association to a specific subject.
2. Once I found some quote or teaching, it was hard to clearly understand the underlying message. I'm kind of new to philosophy, so most times the language used was difficult for me to understand.

So I ended up building an app that would help me with that. I'm not intending to do self-promotion so I wont share any particular details, but I imagine if its helping me now, it can potentially help others.

So I would like to know what people practicing Stoicism think about the concept and what I could do to make it useful to others, so I can share it through the appropriate channels.

It works as follow:

1. You enter some situation you're going through your life. Could be anything, from minor things that happen on your day-to-day to more meaningful situations that affect your overall wellbeing.
2. The app scan through a set of stoic books looking for quotes or teachings that relate to your scenario.
3. Using AI, the app display's the following:
   1. The quote extracted from the books, exactly as it was taken from the source.
   2. The quote explained in plain english. No complex or ancient language, the quote is explained as a friend would explain it to you.
   3. An explanation of how a stoic would handle the situation you're going through. Everything based on the quote mentioned in point no. 1.

# Example

**My scenario:**

*I'm working on expanding my social circle and building meaningful friendships. It's not easy for me to connect with new people and maintain those relationships since I'm very shy*

**The quote taken from books:**

*Judge no speech or action unworthy of you which is consistent with nature. Be not dissuaded by any consequent criticism or censure from others; but, if the speech or action be honourable, judge yourself worthy to say or do it. Those who criticize you have their own conscience and their own motives. These you are not to regard, but follow a straight course, guided by your own nature and the nature of the Universe, both of which point the same way.*

**The quote explained:**

Do not let the opinions or criticisms of others discourage you from pursuing actions that are in line with your own nature and the nature of the Universe. If your intentions are honorable, consider yourself worthy of engaging in those actions or expressing those thoughts. The judgments and motives of others should not influence your decisions, as they have their own perspectives and motivations. Instead, stay true to yourself and follow the path that aligns with your nature and the greater order of the Universe.

**The quote in the context of my scenario:**

In your scenario of expanding your social circle and building meaningful friendships, it is important to remember that you should not let the shyness or potential criticism from others deter you from connecting with new people. The quote emphasizes that you should not judge your own actions or words as unworthy simply because they may be met with criticism or disapproval. Instead, if your intentions are genuine and honorable, you should consider yourself worthy of making the effort to connect with others and build meaningful relationships. The opinions and judgments of others should not hinder your pursuit of social connections, as they have their own perspectives and motivations. Stay true to your own nature and the natural inclination for human connection, and do not let external factors discourage you from taking action.

"Stoic advice for friendship, unrequited love, and loss?"," 

Hello everyone, I need some Stoic advice on how to deal with friendship, unrequited love, and impending loss. I apologize; I am somewhat of a lapsed Stoic, as I've been out of practice for a while now. I can see where my mistakes are, but I need advice and resources on how best to correct them.

Here's the story. I met a guy; we're both in college, and we quickly became friends over the last year. Slowly, I began having romantic feelings for him, culminating in me asking him out. He kindly refused and said he would rather stay friends, which I accepted, hoping my heart would follow suit. We stayed close friends, but I noticed I'd become far too attached to him. I tend to get a bit anxious when we don't talk/see each other for a while, for example. I think this is most likely because I still have feelings for him (I wish I could just flip a switch and no longer feel love). I recently realized that once we graduate, we will most likely not see much of each other, if ever again, which fills me with dread. Clearly, I've become too emotionally attached. Therein lies the question: How can I emotionally distance myself from someone without ruining a friendship? In essence, how to make someone a preferred indifferent. The majority of answers I find online are to abandon the friendship and move on, but I value him as a person beyond a mere imagined romantic partner, or at least I hope I do. I am sorry this is a somewhat complicated problem dealing with attachment, love, friendship, loss, etc., but I suppose that is the human condition. 

Any advice or sources of wisdom for a struggling Stoic would be greatly appreciated.

How do I accept my tics and restlessness,"For years now I have plagued by tics and restlessness originating from what I presume to be the stresses of an adhd brain. 

These tics occur the moment I begin to read (again, due to what I presume to be pent up adhd frustrations) and sometimes outside of reading. 

Having to perform these tics makes me feel like a slave to my broken brain.

I want to defend Karl Jaspers' critique of Stoicism.,"This is an old post, with an ignorant comment about ""the mind in itself is empty...""

Source: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/q35vsg/karl\_jaspers\_on\_stoicism/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/q35vsg/karl_jaspers_on_stoicism/)

As for the ""non-savoir"" or ""no-mind"", it is a pure experience (proposed by William James, Nishida Kitaro and Karl Jasper,...). In that experience, you and the object are one, you have no wrong thinking about that object, do not put evil feelings on that object, you even intuitively perceive that object. This is the feeling of Jesus, Buddha, Plotinus, Socrates, Confucius, Lao Tzu.

This experience often occurs while you work in the ""flow state"".

Karl Jaspers wants to say something the Stoics if they still shape their thinking according to Stoic theories. Then they will not have absolute freedom.

But, Seneca and Marcus also have a sense of pure experience. Because Seneca used his inner self to observe himself and discovered that he was greedy for power when others took the seat reserved for high-ranking people. Or like Marcus Aurelius who always discovered greed when eating, and then used negative thinking to reduce that desire.

In short, what Karl Jaspers wanted the Stoics to do is that ""if you have access to no mind-non savoir (nirvāṇa of buddhism), then never shape your thinking within the framework of Stoic again.

My view on life,"If one could live eternally, their life would lost meaning, death gives meaning to life. So I think this reincarnation cycle is designed by the eternal being so that it can live meaningful lives limitlessly, and we are the incarnation of that eternal being. I also think that not only human but all living beings are the incarnation/avatar of that eternal being, as it’ll give it every possible way to experience life. There is a proverb in my culture, saying that hell and heaven are not in another universe/afterlife, but we are actually living in hell and heaven now, in the present, our life become hellish by the wrongdoings of others and it feels heaven by the love of others. As we all are the incarnation of the same being, so no karma will go unnoticed, unpunished or unrewarded, any wrongdoing we do to other beings is only wrongdoing toward us, as we are the same being, only in a different form, the same goes for the kindness, empathy, love and care we show to other beings are just received by us consequently.

I've been stuck in a rut for so long. Help.,"It all started back in July last year when I got Long Covid conditions. I got depressed and unmotivated and soon after I fell into what I now call a rut. It was all gradual but basically my life currently feels like a repetitive cycle.
I wake up, pray, exercise a bit and bath, and start my day. But I have no plan cause in the middle of that I'm caught up with my phone (this is a huge problem for it), 
I want to pray the rosary but I feel like it can get too long (long story short, on average, nowadays, it takes me around 1 hour and 50 minutes to complete 5 mysteries) so I basically hold off praying it (I break up the decades on schooldays but sometimes don't finish it) 
I want to do tasks like studying (it's literally exam week and I studied little) because when I haven't prayed the Rosary, It feels like I did not complete a task and so it hurts going back and forth. 
When I do pray, my head already feels sick beforehand and I feel loud beats, my eyes hurt too.
My focus has been going up and down and Everytime I do the good habits, I fall back again. I'm hardly consistent. Even if I tried to take it slow and build up, I just can't seem to do so.

I feel horrible but at the same time I'm giving my best in being joyful and positive. I'm not depressed or anxious either.

I feel horrible too because I haven't made any progress in life. My spiritual life has beeing going up and down but one thing is that I've sticked with God and clinged to him.

I feel horrible because I don't see any progress in my goals, spiritually, physically and even on my career.

I want to be an artist to glorify God but currently, I have zero skills on any instrument (can't afford classes currently) and I have nothing to produce music with. I also want to make a fashion brand but that's another thing. 

My grades seem all over the place and over the past here, I've been wanting to switch electives for my classes.

I've been inconsistent in working out too. I go to the gym here and there mostly because I only use e-hailing as a means of transportation and I can't afford monthly membership.  cut out sugar and seed oils from my diet. I thank God that my body still feels good but it hasn't seemed to progress much.

I could go on and on but let me say, I'm still grateful for everything and thank God I can still type this out.

I just don't feel productive, consistent and truly acting on my goals. I get easily distracted and my focus  all over the place.im broke so I can't afford much for my goals of music and artistry.
I feel like I'm letting God down,  just has given me everything I need and I'm not taking action in building his Kingdom.

Whats a stoics take on crisis aid?,"I am new to stoicism. Please be kind.
What is a stoics take on providing help to a stranger at a time of their personal crisis? This is from a philosophical standpoint.
Think of this way. It is our ability to deal with difficulties that make us more able. Yet at the same time there are difficulties which are meaninglessly harsh like an ongoing civil war. Or a bad debt in family due to someone's crippling illness. Yes, such difficulties often create diamonds. But more often than not, they break other equally valuable gemstones. Maybe a maths genius is not street smart enough to flourish in a civil war (even though he is not directly affected enough to deem life or death threat) or some great artist is not a financial genius. Does it make sense to have NGOs who support people in crisis, not just in food, supplies and monetary during a crisis but also skill based. Some NGO which helps solve crippling problems which arise out of a complex daily life. Like a religious institution like a church or religious clergy, but without the encroachment on personal decisions or moral high ground or ritualism. (I am not against personal faith but rather granduer of any religion including mine)
How does an ideal version of that ngo like that affect a community in the long run? Is it good, is it bad? Does the community grow or become reliant? What are the risks of a non-ideal version of that NGO?

"Trying to change the opinions of people on the internet is Stoic, but is it worth it?","
The Stoic advice is to try and educate people who are thinking or acting in a way that's against society. It's advised to walk away if this isn't possible and to perhaps try and help with any fallout of their behaviour.

So recently, if I've had an instant urge (propathesia) to downvote someones post or comment, I've examined that response more closely. I decided to try and understand why they think like this, and bring their attention to their thought process, and the ways they can change it to be more in line with Stoic thinking. I've done this with the intention to help, but it recently wasn't received well.

It makes more sense focus my energy on people who want to change, and who are looking for Stoic advice. But at the same time the people who could benefit most from thinking differently are those who might currently be more closed to it.",Stoicism,1686415428.0,t3_1464wfs,0.56,1
Stoic Music,"Music has always been a major, often the most, impactful influence/medium/inspiration to carry me through tough times.

I have been amazed at how simple and TRUE the concepts land with my worldview, but also how they challenge my worldview in healthy ways.

This discovery has inspired me to revisit formative music from my adolescence such as Time for Living (see the song “Discount Brick”, please…life’s too short for defeat).

"Going to an exam without studying, how to accept the reality?","This test is tomorrow, it's like A-levels and will determine which universities I can apply to. So, last year I had lost my dog just before the same god damn exam and thus messed up, luckily managed to graduate though. Took a gap year.

Is stoicism practical for current human beings?,"Stoicism is a philosophy for evolved humans, not for current humans. For some, my assertion might sound obvious; for others, maybe arrogant. But every now and then I learn of people that struggles to think or behave as a stoic but fails at the end. I think that the problem is that Reason (what Nature gives us and defines us as human) is a double edged sword: it gives good advice when we're not stressed or worried (reading uncle Seneca is a source of good advises); but on the other hand, when combined with our primitive instincts, Reason becomes our enemy.

It's surprising that animals (which don't possess reason and are driven by instincts) live a peaceful life as long as they're not in danger. However, in case of human beings, Reason gives instincts the power of time and space extrapolation. Reason tells the inner brain: ""hey, you're not hungry now, but tomorrow you can be"". And this is fatal because the loop Reason-instincts locks by itself. 

I think human beings are not evolved enough to implement stoicism as a way of life. Maybe in the future we are not partially driven by instincts anymore. So far the best thing we can do is to have people around (or this subreddit) that reminds us the stoic precepts in order to find a way that takes us out of the darkness we feel we live in from time to time.",Stoicism,1655408600.0,t3_vdu8zt,0.5,0
My mind is kinda in shambles. It's not the biggest of problems but it has caused me some annoyance.,"Ok so I would like to have a stoic perspective on this. 

I am a femboy and am only accepted I certain places (at least with my femininity). But those places are filled certain dangerous political ideologies or they tolerate those ideologies (I'm talking about really extremes of the spectrum here). I don't like those ideologies and I don't want to see them. But if I bring the issue up, I get shot down. And if I go to other spaces, I won't be accepted as a femboy or see stuff aren't really accepting of people like me. I don't want to conduct myself either with bigots or with extremists. I feel like I'm not really accepted anywhere.

And ofc I'm not accepted irl as I live in South Asia. What do I do in this situation? I'm really at a loss, maybe I'm forgetting something but idk where I can be a femboy and not face extremist apologetics or people that tolerate them at a regular rate.

Friends Depth instead of breath!,"My philosophy when it comes to friend is to focus on depth rather than breath. In the modern world, people have hundreds of friends, but it's very surface level and superficial I find. I focus on only having a handful of **really** good friend where I invest all my time and energy. For the rest of the people I know, I give them my Facebook where I only sign in once every 3-6months.

I just don't think that humans have adapted to knowing dozens of thousands of people and making friends with thousands of them. Your time is finite, so you should only really nurture the relationships that have value (to you and the other person; in a reciprocal manner). If you wanted to invest all your time maintaining 100s of relationships, it would probably end up looking like chatting on messenger for 30min a week while they're distracted with something else. 

Instead, I have decided to only focus on a few dozen friends with depth. I could call any of them and we could organize a hiking trip, camping, skiing, a trip to Japan. Or even, I can be sure they'll be there for me if I need help etc.

What about people who need to be taught a lesson?,"I've had two uncomfortable encounters that have had me thinking all day about how one should deal with some people... The first one is ridiculous, I passed by a guy, on the sidewalk (I'm roller skating), he moves oddly, looks off, throws some paper towel on the floor, just bad vibe. As I pass by him he yells at me asking what I want and why I'm looking at him wrong. I kept going. Later on, commuting to work by bike, some buy in a van decided to overtake me even though he didn't have enough room for it because I wasn't going fast enough for his taste. The fact that I was going as fast as the car in front of me and likely to overtake it at the next red light didn't deter him. His side mirror almost hit me.

And it just gets me thinking... Am I making the world a better place if I let these people to get their way, be reckless with others' lives, and just be bullies ? On the other hand, am I doing well if I get myself into situations that will turn up bad ? The first guy couldn't have been reasoned with, he just looked so angry for no reason, if I had wanted to confront him it would have been for a fight... The second guy in the car, I could have smashed his window, he might have gotten out of the car, could have run me over after that, I don't know...

But at the same time I figure if that van guy had done the same to my wife, who's not as comfortable as I am on a bike, she could have tripped, get run over... The other guy, had I not been a guy, somewhat in shape, might have decided to just attack straight away...

A part of me feels like twice today I missed the opportunity to teach some people that they can't just do the shit they want and that if neither justice nor karma nor something spiritual like that will force them to be good people, then other people will...

Was I stoic before I even knew about it?,"In my early teenage I was a very anxious and negative version of myself... I cared a lot about having a successful life, pleasing others and so on. 

But when I became 16, I started to think about something I had never been aware of, death. I lived my life without worrying about it, because it had always looked so distant, but then I had become 16, and I realize how fast time passes... It was like yesterday when I was 8 years old and wondered how would be life when I become 15?? And now I am already 17, so I won't even realize when I become 30, 60 and until the arrival of my final day (which may be be tomorrow), so death become something that looked far, but very close at the same time, and sometimes I even panic about death. 

This made me lose my anxiety, I started to think ""well, I will be dead, so why should I worry about what others think or how successful I am going to be? Just live life!"" And I felt very amazing, I would appreciate things that I had never realized how relaxing and joyful they are, going for a walk, beholding in a park and so on, not caring about anything, since the future is uncertain, and I can't control this fact. 

But after my 16s, I started to lose these awarenesses, and I don't have any clues of why... I am way better than before (I am not extremely negative and anxious like before) but I can still get a little anxious and sometimes care about what others think (which limits happiness imo).

Then, I saw stuff about stoicism, and I identified a lot to it (when I was around my 15/16 years. I would like to be that person again. But it feels that I am into some kind of mindset...

Philosophers Are Content To Be Seen As Fools,"I have schizophrenia (what I believe is OCD/Schizospectrum disorder).  Stoicism fixed it in about 5 minutes!! (along with meds) while all the advice I received over the years messed me up even more, and more, and more.

Epictetus warned repeatedly against announcing that you're stoic, pretending you're someone or knew something, or teaching it unless you are so deeply anchored in it that you can remain in a ""state conformable to nature.""

I tell people I have schizophrenia which serves as an alibi about why I'm so calm and so quiet.  I tell people well those are the symptoms (poverty of speech, apathy), etc.  Then I look ""retarded"" and they leave me alone.  Sometimes they don't believe me but it doesn't have to be perfect.

Should more blame be placed on Marcus Aurelius?,"Marcus Aurelius is considered to be the paragon of stoic values and epitomized Plato's vision of a, ""Philosopher King"" but was the appointing of Commodus in 177 the most prudent thing to do? The four emperors before him all chose their heirs based on the heir's merit not lineage. Although they had no kids to choose from, this seemed to be a more beneficial way to choose a successor. 

Although we have the benefit of hindsight, and know the man Commodus would become; I think that Marcus Aurelius had enough information at the time to know that it may have been more prudent to wait until Commodus was older. He could have also tried to engineer a peaceful succession to another candidate altogether. Although these aren't perfect solutions, they do seem less sentimental. Although he was a great ruler in his day to day reign, is this misstep a slip of his philosophy into the sentimental, or is it prudent under stoicism but not modern day consequentialism?",Stoicism,1551644638.0,t3_awy47d,0.56,1

"Really, do you live as if you will die tomorrow?","I see myself as a spiritual being having a human experience. That is a misquote I stole but it seems accurate. I also read something about a bomb defuser saying they do not feel stressed because they either do it right or its not their problem anymore. I carry this as a staple and it has benefited me a lot I accept the consequences or all my actions and my own mortality.

I've self harmed twice. The first was in Prague someone ridiculously attractive and as crazy as me had a smoking fetish. 3 hours of craziness left I had 21 cigarette burns on my arm. A few days ago I carved a different woman's initial on my thigh. I did it because she sees it as a sign of love and while I think love has no price, fuck it right? She would love me without me doing it I know she would but the fact that it is free and I paid anyway, that's a reciprocation of what she means to me. I get no rush from any of this no thrill no fetish or kink it's more that, I see myself as a bottle of water. No one cares about the plastic they care about the water. I am a sealed container and I know that while cutting is a reflection of poor mental state for me this is literally just that I live as if I will die because I will! It also had no influence on my mental state besides a bit of shame and embarrassment considering future explanations. Imagine me giving this speech to a one night stand lmao. If you fell over and scarred your knee you wouldn't feel bad about falling would you? No stigma, you just fell. I can do the same thing here. I am not cutting to vent pain or struggling to handle existence it was just... fuck it, it doesn't affect me but it will affect someone I love, positively. Why not? It is a purely pragmatic approach.

I believe expectations depict 80&#37; of the outcome of life anyway so i like to live as in the moment as possible. I am backpacking Europe for a month on my own soon as I did last year and with nothing but a small bag and a one way ticket, no accommodation no plans of countries or people to be with. Last time I did this I lost my phone and wallet 2 days in. The last day of that trip I woke up realized damn I booked the flight for today instead of tomorrow, had to book the last available night bus from Berlin to Amsterdam and fly home. Since I had no phone I had no way of knowing where the bus stop was besides a paper map I had to download, and even to this day I have no which way is North East South or West. I arrived at the bust stop 30 minutes late to find the bus had been delayed an hour. Now while I can assure you, the time trying to find that bus stop was as stressed as I am physically capable of feeling, I survived, and I made it through knowing that I have found the rim of the spectrum of emotion, been there and returned unscathed. Had I missed the bus, i would have deserved to from my actions and poor planning. And been still, unscathed.

I am forever unscathed, and that trip was the best time of my life by FAR.

I consider myself sane in a world full of crazy people and I am typing this to what I consider the sanest community I have found. I know I will be considered unorthodox or crazy or whatever and I consider myself how stable I really am occasionally but in general I keep on top of my own mental health without therapy or medication or external forces and I think regardless of how reckless I treat life that is the cornerstone of stoicism.  I used to do motorracing when I lived off of the bank of Daddy and that taught me that if you don't crash or spin out occasionally you are not even close to testing the boundaries. If I can be 90 and have had no close calls no near misses no lucky chances, no physically signs of wear and tear, then I've not lived. Not to my potential. I have played life safe and safety, comfort, security, they are not stoicism, they are hiding from the times when stoicism can keep you moving forward. Discuss :P

She also antagonizes the class whenever we don't give her the proper ""energy"" she desperately craves in the morning (as a side note, all the classes I have problems with happen to be led by females who can't control the situation or their emotions, and that's another major stress factor).

The only parts of stoicism I can agree with.,"How I agree:

I agree that people make their pain worse by interpreting it as bad. If you just did not think about the pain in any form, then the pain would hurt less. If you find virtue in the endurance of pain, then pain will hurt less. If you are creative and can find the positive in any situation, including pain, than pain will hurt less.

I agree that you should not expect anything other than hardship and make the most out of whatever you are stuck with. You should accept what is not in your control and not base your happiness on what is not in your control. All we can control is our ability to chose. To chose how we judge the pain and chose our attitude in any given situation. You should base your happiness on what is in your control. We can only control our virtue and therefore must teach ourselves to base our happiness and peace on our virtue. We must not strive to to avoid or acquire but to be free of the need to avoid or acquire. This is the path to peace.

How I differ:

Some things are worth emotionally investing in because the growth as a person outweighs the inevitable pain from loss. Such as family, hiking, reading, friends, and lovers. As long as you are aware that those things are impermanent and have learned to accept that, than the pain will hurt less when they do leave your life. It is about preparing yourself for pain in order to minimize it's impact on you. being mindful of your thought also contributes to minimize your pain.

Our thoughts do have a profound effect on the world we create for ourselves. The hardware of the mind fallows the lead of the conscious mind. The unconscious and subconscious minds do a lot of work at the command of the conscious mind. For the most part, our brain can create what what we teach it to create. Our thoughts have a profound impact on our mind. we must become masters of our thoughts to find peace.",Stoicism,1492018600.0,t3_64zo7h,0.5,0

"Misunderstanding about ""Neo""-Stoicism","It has become a kind of fashion to talk about ""Neo""-Stoicism. In order to discuss the matter properly we need a definition of this term. If we go back to Justus Lipsius we'll find no significant contribution to the system so we can define it as something new besides the fact that he tried like a biased Christian of the time to fit the system to his religion. But this also is nothing new as many of the Church fathers attempted at least partially the same thing in the 3-6 centuries. Lipsius himself was not thoroughly acquainted with Stoicism, particularly the Physics so it is at least strange to talk about ""Neo"" just because it happned 12 centuries later. 

If we follow thic logic we should talk about ""Neo""-chemistry or ""Neo""-physics which is likewise absurd. Same with Stoicism. All the prefixes like ""neo"", ""ultra"", ""modern"" are based on a profound lack of knowledge (and even worse: half-knowledge) about the system and/or a desire for fame.


Stoicism as the science of the whole of life which offers a logical and encompassing explanation of the world is a synopsis of millenia old wisdom and, at least for my understanding, comparing it to Egyptian, Indian, Chinese and Western philosophical movements remains unsurpassed in its cohesiveness and explanatory force.

I feel like I raped my GF early on in our relationship. Where do I go from here?,"Long story short, When me (24m) and my gf (26f) started dating a few months ago, the first time we had sex, after first starting with a condom, I asked if she’d want to have sex without a condom. She asked me if had done an STD test recently. I said I did one a few months prior and it came back negative.

Then she asked me if I had had unprotected sex after that test. I told her no. That was a lie. I did. I slept with a girl a few times after doing the test and before meeting my now-girlfriend. 

When I told her no I didn’t think it was a big deal. I tested negative and had only slept with one person after that who I trust, so to me it seemed like it wasn’t a big deal to just say I hadn’t slept with anyone after the test.

A few weeks ago I read there’s such a thing as “rape by deception” ie lying or hiding information which makes consent invalid. Suddenly I realized that she probably wouldn’t have consented to sex without the condom if I told her the truth. Ever since that realization a few weeks ago I haven’t been able to sleep, I can’t think of anything else literally and I feel like a monster. I can’t look my gf in the eyes anymore. Where do I go from here? To start, yes I have done another STD test which also came back negative so it’s not like I gave her anything and we’re safe, but I have no clue how to deal with this guilt.

I don’t want to kill myself but I see it as the only viable solution for my life to become better.,"Im 21. I am fully aware that killing or harming oneself does against the Stoic virtues and should be avoided/forgone, no matter the struggle in front of us.

With that said, I have this nagging feeling that my life is a wasted one. While I’ve made real attempts to change from who I once was, I grew up a very fake kid. Alone at home but acted like he was perfect at school. My dad passed when I was young, and it was very hard to be positive growing up. My brother went down a bad, bad rabbit hole and my mother was working her ass off. I became the hope of the family. They had no time for me and I understood that. So I stayed in school, didn’t do drugs, friends with the right people. This was all until end of sophomore-junior year high school. Those years are important because I hit a total shift

I went through a break up with my girl. It was the fact I lost her through my FAKE attitude. She didn’t know what was going on with me because I never wanted her to know. I ended up getting too comfortable and my emotions + lifestyle rubbed off on her. She didn’t wanna break up either, but she couldn’t stand to see me change so mysteriously (in her eyes). And I understand that, imagine your lover unexpectedly acting different than usual. 

I started skipping school, purposely doing bad/but just enough to pass, I did drugs. Not because it was fun, but because my brother would do them so I said why not. Obviously, it helped me COPE with my problems.  I ended up making a lot of bad decisions. I became someone with EGO and filled with hate. I was no longer nice, it was petty. 

I turned quiet, I started to embrace the bad side of me because it felt like it was me against the world. It made me feel powerful when it really was a way to cope with my shitty feelings everyday.  

I almost made the attempt to kill myself with pills. I couldn’t do it. I love my mom, and I couldn’t stand to put that pain for her. She doesn’t know that. Fast forward im in college, isolated. Covid. I almost made the attempt once again. I called my mom to drop something off so I could see her and when I did, I changed my mind. 

I came home shortly after that and didn’t go back to my dorm the whole year.

THIS is when I decided to start changing. I got diagnosed for bipolar disorder and depression etc. but I’m not taking those those pills….I started a holistic and spiritual journey which helped a lot. It’s turned me into someone I can have some respect for. It turned me towards god and I discovered the power of following good morals. 

Yet, I don't know how to deal with this. It’s the fact i live this life now due to my fuck ups that still eats me. Im not happy I just learned how to deal with it. I would be lying if I told you everything is okay apart from my self love journey. I’m still in debt, working 9-5 in college at home while people are heading into their careers. I’m still confused in my life. Im still alone at home because my mom and I don’t talk. It’s hard since she’s a foreign parent. My family are in one big feud, and I don’t have cousins or even my brother to talk to. I have friends but they only know me from a surface level. I’ve been lucky to have 2 friends who cared about me. I still think about that girl I dated 5 years ago. I’ve never dated someone since and I don’t think I will. I also lost some people as friends.

My father is an enigma..,"I [33M], like many, used to think as my father as stoic, however, he's gotten soft and depressed in his older age, especially now that he's retired.

I enjoy giving him this credit but I've also done a fair bit of development personally, professionally, emotionally, spiritually, and have had other mentors over the last 5-10 years.

A Question to Non-Male Stoics: Do Male Pronouns Annoy You?,"I’m a male and am happy with whatever pronouns are in the text, as I’m there to learn. But, being in the majority, my opinion is naturally biased.  

When you read quotes such as: 

“Man conquers the world by conquering himself.” ― Zeno of Citium

Do you interpret ‘man’ as meaning ‘human’ or male?

And what would you advise for modern writing? To use female and male pronouns interchangeably, as many authors do? 

The rise of transgender pronouns could quickly make even modern texts seem dated. Third-person pronouns can’t be included in writing in place of first unless you wish to confuse the reader.

For example: They conquers the world by conquering themself - makes no sense. 

As a writer, I find knowing the correct approach tricky, especially for future proofing my writing. I have no wish to alienate people, especially from philosophy that’s historically used only male pronouns. 

I’m asking in this sub, as I want to ask readers, not English grammar educators, as it doesn’t matter what’s ‘right,’ but what people feel comfortable with. Otherwise, they’ll just avoid the writing altogether. 

I realize that we should all consider this ‘indifferent,’ but undoubtedly, we can have an opinion on what is preferred.  

TL;DR: Do non-male readers of Stoicism get annoyed by the use of solely male pronouns? If so, what would you recommend to writers?",Stoicism,1659184707.0,t3_wbwlmz,0.43,0
Wishing bad on anti-vaxxer and Stoicism,"Yesterday I picked up my brother from the airport.  
He still isn't vaccinated, and is leaning towards an anti-vaxxer mode of thinking (not extreme, but still not taking care of it in the way I think should be done).  


Listening to him I had the thought/feeling that he should get Covid and have a painful experience (ie. respirator, even death).  


The next morning I woke up contemplating about this thought/feeling and whether it was too harsh, since in the end I do not wish him bad.

"I do not recommend ""How to be a Stoic"" by Massimo Pigliucci","When I started this book, I expected a philosophical manual on Stoicism, at the end of a most underwhelming read however, what was delivered was a poorly written and thinly disguised self-help book.

It started out decently enough though, a brief history of the philosophy, followed by an examination of its main tenets. All the good in it was contained in the first 20% and even then there were traces of the navel-gazing to come. Everything after... shockingly poor.

Never have I seen an author miss the mark so much. The decision to write this in first-person only served to show how flawed the author is, all of his biases and prejudices were laid bare.

You would see interesting chapter titles that ended up being neither informative or thought-provoking, for someone who never missed the opportunity to tell the reader how non-religious he is, the whole book had an air of boring preachiness about it.

"Erm….at times, it doesn’t work!","I’ve read letters from a Stoic and a lot of meditations.  This was a while ago. 

A life of virtue has some dangers.  I really embraced it at the time, essentially it made me a target for being taken for a ride. 

There are a lot of pretty bad people out there.  They will exploit you, especially if they understand you live with integrity. 

Many times I tried to console myself with living with virtue.  There are many people who lived with virtue and lost everything and are now alone.  

I think it’s important to stress that the way you treat others absolutely does not guarantee you anything from others.  

I think I fundamentally reject the notion that true happiness is derived from being virtuous.   True happiness is derived from various forms of power.  Not necessarily the abuse of power, but power nonetheless.

Criticism of Stoicism,">The arguments against Stoicism that are effective for me, are that the Stoic virtues of rationality, and prudence about their physical existence, fail to capture the values that matter more in this life.

>Stoic rationality, and their resistance to emotions, gets in the way of their experiencing and benefiting from Love, Joy, and enthusiasm. If one holds by a Love Virtue ethic, this makes stoicism a harmful ideology. Stoics tend instead to hold by either a Truth virtue ethic, or by a utilitarian consequentialism, in which they presume that life is material.

>The physicalism that is intrinsic to stoicism makes their valuation of integrity over mere survival hard to justify. Will a stoic sell out refugees to a Nz search party? Will a stoic perform a negative rational cost-benefit analysis of your low value to him while you are asleep while you two are lost in a lifeboat? Virtues, morality, and integrity, presuppose the reality of non-physical values. And while values and integrity were generally held to by stoics in practice, the theory to justify this choice appears to be in conflict with a core assumption of the philosophy.

Objection To The Negative Visualization Principle in Stoicism,"Negative visualization is the flaw of stoic thought and practice. While I understand the idea it is flawed in the fact that a persons thoughts are energy. Our thoughts, particularly thoughts that are repeated and focused on will have a tendency to materialize through our subconscious.

One may argue that this visualization negative or otherwise is inevitable so you are only preparing yourself. I disagree with this argument because life is an agreement between that which we can control and can't control. With that being as it is, we can control our thoughts, and it is counterproductive to the aims of a good life to seed negative thoughts. Furthermore, for people who suffer from trauma and anxiety this technique will definitely create an unwanted result.

So what is the alternative?

The Path of Most Resistance

I submit that The Path of Most Resistance is the way to build up the character ""skill"" that negative visualization aspires to develop.

The path of most resistance is the idea that when faced with a choice in life, instead of always looking for the easy way to your desired goal or destination choose the one with the most foreseeable resistance.

Why do this and why does it work?

Mans only real power in life is his choice. When a man chooses to the path of most resistance he is ACCEPTING by choice the unknown experiences of resistance. This is important because at the core of difficult experiences lies the fundamental struggle of acceptance of what is or resisting what is. 

Sitting around thinking about what you don't want will not prepare you, choosing to accept that which you already know is not pleasant will prepare you to deal with real life situations. 

The ensuing experiences from making such a bold choice will prepare and reveal yourself to you on many levels. The rewards and preparation that one derives from this way pays exponentially more dividends than seeding negative thoughts and energy into your universe and beyond.

"Hell, Camus, and the Ancient Stoics","I have a thought experiment and a question for y'all. 

**(The setup)**

Imagine that on the Day of Judgement, God, the Christian god, banishes the ancient Stoics to Hell. 

There are many Christian views on Hell, but let's suppose this Hell is an *inescapable*, *eternal* stream of *torment*. 

I know there are many Christians on this sub. Out of respect for their faith, let's not argue but simply suppose that the Ancient Stoics come to the conclusion that the Christian God is unjustful and thus not worthy of worship. Their claim is that an inescapable, eternal stream of torment is unjustifiable and inappropriate for punishment for whatever ""sins"" they committed in their finite lifetimes. If humans can forgive their persuctors, they reason, then surely the ""all loving"" Christian God can forgive. And if humans have the instinct to correct, rather than just punish, bad behavior , surely the ""all loving"" Christian God would eventual seize the torment so that people could reintegrate back into a relationship with God. 

**(The question)**

What attitude would the Ancient Stoics take in Hell? How would they handle themselves in Hell?

To be clear, this is just speculation. I speculate the Stoics would forgive the Christian God. I would imagine them like Camus said of Sisyphus:  *One must imagine Sisyphus happy*

And I would even imagine Epictutus whispering to himself:

> To incarceration. Do I have to complain about it? To exile. Is there anyone stopping me from going with a smile, joyful and content? ... **You'll shackle my leg, but not even Zeus can conquer my will.** 'I'll throw you in prison. My body. 'I'll cut off your head? Well, have you ever heard me suggest that I'm unique in having a non-detachable head?

But how should a stoic view those emotions? It may not be healthy to reject them... some emotions are the vehicle for realization and recognition of repressed truth. Like feeling anger at an abuser, that anger is communicating to our deep subconscious and validating the pain. It would not be healthy to not assent to that emotion, and invalidate your pain by being indifferent.

I would cry in the shower and scheme of ways to get rid of it. My family loved him but I communicated to them that I was having panic attacks and mental breakdowns. They were very upset with me and blamed my mental illness but understood and now the rabbit is gone back to his foster home.

Aang: I know, there's positive Jing when you're attacking and negative Jing when you're retreating.

King Bumi: And neutral Jing, when you do nothing. Neutral Jing is the key to earth bending. It involves listening and waiting for the right moment to strike. You're teacher will be someone who listens and wait.

I wonder, what if the ""right moment to strike"" never comes. At what point do you stop waiting. I have refallen for a former girlfriend(dealing with childhood issues in therapy brought me to the conclusion that  there was unfinished business with her). It's one sided unrequited love and being a highly sensitive person, I am probably expressing my affection in a demanding, intense and unrealistic way. Ave said what I needed to say and am now waiting patiently for her to return my affection. 

If she does, I'll celebrate it, but what if she doesn't, what if she takes too long and love being whimsical I have already moved on. What would've been the point of excersing patience. Isn't patience a form of hoping that events out of control will go our way?

Does stoicism make unmotivated and less disciplined people?,"
 Does the stoic method of expecting the worst, telling yourself the worst case scenario will happen continuously, make you much less motivated to reach for high goals? 

I feel like I suffer from this, actually “convincing” myself the worst possible outcome will happen makes me comfortable in mediocrity, I feel like. 

If I try and reach for the limit the chances are very large that the worst scenario is realized, partially because the chances of succeeding are -objectively- small.

why would a stoic get married?,"What purpose does it serve ? 

Is it to have and raise kids in a stable environment?  If so why is having kids preferred? 
Few people not having kids is not going to significantly affect the society. 

Or is marriage preffered as human beings desire love and companionship? If that's the case, a lot of other things that human beings desire is discouraged ( example, casual sex ). 

I can't find a good answer for how getting married and having kids is helpful for the society and choosing to get married for the sake of fullfilling the desire to be loved and to have a companion seems selfish to me. 

Infact, if a person avoids marriage, he can save a lot of time and money to do good. 

But actually, i have a strong desire to get married and have kids, i just don't know if desire is a good enough reason to get married. 

But if i do get married( I'm single currently) and have kids, there's a chance that the marriage might end in divorce, hurting the kids.

I'm having a pretty bad time and its worse because I'm literally in the best position in my life I have ever been in. I'm trying to remember that its just myself making me feel like this but I'm still just down in the dumps.

A few months ago I posted about using the facet of stoicism of enjoying the process and not end result to have the courage to tell a girl I have feelings for her.

After reflecting on that I will admit I was wrong to do that. Both using her as my object to complete a goal and also being overly forward in the very initial phases of the interaction were not virtuous or attractive.

Since then I have learned a lot more about dating and been having better results than getting straight shut down, and even got a few hookups and girls interested in me.

However, after a few months in the dating market I feel pretty weak and beat up mentally.

My biggest concern is why I am in good shape, taking care of myself, good financially, handsome, and an insightful human being, and doing overall great in life, And then the only women that really give me a chance are women who I feel have not worked on themselves as much as I have.

I've been trying to be open minded and giving girls I wouldn't normally a chance.

I enjoy rock climbing and doing uphill sprints to stay in shape, but why is it that I am only getting opportunity to be with a woman who is 50-100lbs overweight and complaining about walking up a hill.

It sucks because when they text me I feel like barfing. Its unfair to them too because they should be with someone who is excited to hear from them. The girl from the post a few months ago totally captivated me just by her presence.

I'm really fucked up about this. And its even more difficult because when I complain about not being able to find a girl who is as good of shape as me and is also fun, then someone else chimes in and says ""oh yea, well my dad just died from corona and because i was grieving so much i lost my job and now i'm about to be homeless"" Its like ok sure yea my problems aren't even problems compared to your problems.

I just look at my friends and they have girlfriends who are hot and cool and I'm having a tough time getting a girl who is either and not attaching the type of girl I can get to my self worth as a human being.

Like yea I've accomplished all this stuff and have great qualities, but then why can I only get single moms who no one wants? What do those guys with good looking girls have why am I lesser than them is what I am thinking.

I'm still working out and eating right and I am not using drugs to cope. I'm going to go skateboarding after this post and try to use the feeling of being close to death to stop myself from worrying about this shit.",Stoicism,1630359712.0,t3_perw7w,0.38,0
Is Stoicism a gateway to Madness?,"By Madness, I mean doing things that should normally be impossible, or maybe suicidal. Not the madness which refers to the dark side of men, e.g. destruction of reason, but the madness of utterly disregarding oneself to achieve one's goal.

I know such extremes usually don't occur in our modern life, but suppose a situation requires you to forfeit your life, a Stoic would calmly and rationally accept it. Normal people will see this as madness, as something utterly unusual, after all, isn't living the most important of all? But a Stoic does not see this as madness but just what he ought to do, no different than cleaning one's yard.

So that returns me back to my question. Stoicism can convince you of what you ought to do and in the process, can Stoicism cause you to act in ways that people would otherwise label as ""Insane""?

I know for certain that Seneca and Socrates' willingness to calmly drink the poison of eternal slumber would be seen by normal people as insane.

Seneca and Socrates probably didn't think of what they did as insane but just, it simply is. What other feats would normal people perceive as the acts of a madman but to a stoic, just another task?

Lastly, I asked this question because in the same way that an evil person does not see himself as evil, so is a madman. He probably don't think he's insane.",Stoicism,1609501841.0,t3_koa3dn,0.55,1
Ex-Stoic with some ideas,"Hi everyone. I used to be a huge believer in stoicism, I now have some reservations. Wondering what everyone thinks about it. The things that caused me to question it were the following:

1) I never understood the basis for the belief that nature is ruled by the logos. I think that Stoicism sees what is rational from a Stoic viewpoint and then retroactively applies that to nature.

2) If nature matches their description and operates according to the logos, then how could someone not act in accordance with that nature? And if someone could successfully defy nature, why doesn’t it call into question the desirability of submitting to that pre-ordained order?

3) I think the psychological viewpoint that one’s mind is totally their domain is questionable, which threatens  the viability of the prescriptions of Stoicism.

4) The elimination or suppression of passion/desire, especially absent a solid objective metaphysics, seems to negate life and get in the way of creating meaning subjectively.",Stoicism,1594957876.0,t3_hsorow,0.5,0

The Freedom to Not Wear Masks,"As I see more and more people refuse to wear masks in the name of freedom, I am reminded of this chapter of The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran.  What do you think of the passage?

&#x200B;

At the city gate and by your fireside I have seen you prostrate yourself and worship your own freedom,

Even as slaves humble themselves before a tyrant and praise him though he slays them.

Ay, in the grove of the temple and in the shadow of the citadel I have seen the freest among you wear their freedom as a yoke and a handcuff.

And my heart bled within me; for you can only be free when even the desire of seeking freedom becomes a harness to you, and when you cease to speak of freedom as a goal and a fulfillment.

You shall be free indeed when your days are not without a care nor your nights without a want and a grief,

But rather when these things girdle your life and yet you rise above them naked and unbound.

And how shall you rise beyond your days and nights unless you break the chains which you at the dawn of your understanding have fastened around your noon hour?

In truth that which you call freedom is the strongest of these chains, though its links glitter in the sun and dazzle your eyes.

And what is it but fragments of your own self you would discard that you may become free?

If it is an unjust law you would abolish, that law was written with your own hand upon your own forehead.

You cannot erase it by burning your law books nor by washing the foreheads of your judges, though you pour the sea upon them.

And if it is a despot you would dethrone, see first that his throne erected within you is destroyed.

For how can a tyrant rule the free and the proud, but for a tyranny in their own freedom and a shame in their own pride?

And if it is a care you would cast off, that care has been chosen by you rather than imposed upon you.

And if it is a fear you would dispel, the seat of that fear is in your heart and not in the hand of the feared.

Verily all things move within your being in constant half embrace, the desired and the dreaded, the repugnant and the cherished, the pursued and that which you would escape.

These things move within you as lights and shadows in pairs that cling.

And when the shadow fades and is no more, the light that lingers becomes a shadow to another light.

And thus your freedom when it loses its fetters becomes itself the fetter of a greater freedom.",Stoicism,1590158512.0,t3_goklfq,0.5,0

Respectful Disagreement with Aurelius,"I value the words of most stoic philosophers.  But I respectfully disagree with Aurelius on something: he said to discipline your thought life.  I don't think we can control our thoughts or that we should try to.

I use the intrusive thoughts as a premeditatio malorum/negative visualization throughout the day.  I don't agree that we should waste 20 minutes in the morning doing it because how can we predict what will actually happen i.e. someone cutting us off in traffic or more importantly, what would actually be threatening?

I think our brain is our best frenemy and knows what actually scares us.  So it will throw those scary things at us so we can problem solve and get our dopamine.  Mine is social rehearsal (jouska?).

My solution to the conflicts most of us face (that the brain brings up) is to \*show\* kindness and virtue through actions rather than words.  I also look at people's actions instead of their words.  In life, I have become a person of few words, but a much nicer person who cares about people.  ",Stoicism,1549593662.0,t3_aobwt6,0.58,2
If and when you have anxieties about your life…,"...Pray fervently to the Lord from your heart in this way:  *“I place my fate in Thy hands, O my Saviour. In the way that Thou knowest, arrange my life as is best. From now on I cut off every care about myself, having but one care, to do what is pleasing before Thee (Here,God as Nature).”* 

This is basically *Amor Fati.*

Speak to God in this way, and by doing so you will already have placed yourself completely in His (Fate) hands, not being concerned about anything, but calmly accepting every sort of situation, pleasant or unpleasant, as being *arranged* (determinism) for you purposely by God (Fate). 

Your only concern should be to act according to (Nature) God’s commandments in everything. This is all that is required of you.

Marcus Aurelius is qualitatively inferior to Epictetus and Seneca,"I have read everything by Aurelius, Epictetus, Senca and Rufus.

Marcus Aurelius just feels dull. He does not write to enlighten or entertain. He adds nothing that is not better put forth in Epictetus or Seneca.

Seems to me he is appreciated because he was a great emperor, not because his book is enlightening. The value of Aurelius rather just is as the diary of a practitioner.

All Stoics are Closeted Epicureans,"That isn't an insult, by the way. In fact, when it comes to detachment, externals, and the approach to death, there isn't much daylight between stoics and epicureans. Epicurus extolled simple pleasures, and argued against ambition, riches, indulgent sex, etc. 

Epicureans view pleasure as moral, and pain as immoral. Therefore, to live a good life, you should live a happy or pleasurable life. And whether you realize it or not, *so do you.*

In the parlance of stoicism, vice would be short term pleasure that ultimately leads to pain.  Virtue on the other hand, is supposed to lead to a good life, by doing good. But stoics believed that doing good should be done for its own sake, and shouldn't be used to gain happiness. And that's where they're wrong. 

For no stoic can do good without expecting some type of gratification. Even the most extreme forms of self-sacrifice come with a measure of gratification, or pleasure, as the epicureans would say. The stoics point to Socrates's suicide as the stoic ideal; yet, the manner of his suicide offered Socrates a measure of gratification before his heart stopped ultimately beating. Even selflessness is ultimately a paradox, as you earn the gratification of being selfless. Therefore, even the most hardcore stoics are epicureans at heart.

However, I live a life where I simply cannot block out others. I must socialize with people. To simply brush things off has never been part of my personality.

blackpill and stoicism,"Hi. I have learned about stoicism from the blackpill community. 

So for a brief idea about what blackpill is, that personality wont help you get women, and women are hypergamous so being average in todays promiscuous society isnt enough. So if you dont have good genetics, it is over for you. However i am not bothered by trivial incel stuff like this. But what bothers me is the wider and more broad view of what the black pill is about. It is said that by face value,  you will be judged by people and rise to great heights or remain in the depths. The black pill community showed some evidences of most successful men today (although anecdotal).and a lot of the were good looking. 

So my question to fellow stoics is (as stoicism ponders about value of human beings), are we as humans losing any value beyond our primal instincts?  Surely,  we wouldnt have come such a long way in society if only the physically superior were seen as leaders.(lets be honest tho, you cant rule people with muscles. It wont take more than 10 people rip a tyrant apart. Trust me on this,  i am a considerably large guy and used to bully others in high school and often got violent pushbacks for bullying others, people can be brutal and vicious against tyrants).

I think i am making this too long.

In short, i want to know 3 things 

1. what makes love between men and women? If a taken women finds a better conventionally attractive man and cheats on his current partner, will she be seen as responding to her innate nature, or should there be repurcussions again the ""animal instincts"" of human beings.

2.how would you suggest making ""shallow"" people(no disrespect) aware about some destructive sides of human nature.

Stoicism is pushing me to becoming vegan,"I used to be a huge meat eater, but as the title says Stoicism is pushing towards veganism.

I have been reading Stoic philosophy for a few years now and it has slowly changed my eating habits.

I began by eating less and eating healthy. Seeing food as something to nourish the body and not as something to desire for pleasure. I ate simple food and took my time to appreciate it (not eating while on my phone or distracted).

Then I started to consider the ethical factors and became vegetarian.

Empathy, Compassion, Benevolence, Rationality. How can we cultivate these virtues if our choices cause suffering?

I can no longer see how we can justify eating animal products when we can live healthy lives as vegans and do less damage to animals.

It seems as though eating animals comes down to a desire for pleasure. That pleasure comes at the expense of other living animals.

Since then I've been diving deeper, death is a part of nature and out of one's control, so in that sense emotions shouldn't be ""controlling"" oneself. 10 out of Marcus Aurelius' 13 children died young, do you think he cried at their funeral?

Is this completely serious?

Can anyone tell me, how this marketing massively manipulator machine can teach how the Virtue shall be achieved? Are we falling into the Scholars-no-example-just-advice-and-guidance section that from Socrates all philosophers tried to relief from society? 

Are we really introducing to the Stoic community, the typical self-book machine creator, apprentice from nothing less than the top self-book impostor, Robert Greene?

If stoicism can't cure depression then what's the point?,"This is a genuine question. Lately I've seen a lot of posts of people coming here seeking guidance who are suffering from some form of depression. The common response I usually hear is to seek professional help and possibly medication(which I agree is probably a good thing to do).

But what I take from Stoicism as it concerns ethics is that all suffering is the result of irrational beliefs. But if the recommended treatment for depression is to seek psychological medical intervention then doesn't that make the point of stoicism kind of obsolete? If ethical stoicism concerns overcoming suffering via rational thinking, and the most rational option is to seek medical intervention then doesn't reason take a backseat?

My boss is absolutely insufferable to be around.,"I recently started a new job and the operation just involves me and my boss as workers, a two man show. We work on a boat so I live with him too. He is 63 years old and I seem to have underestimated how much being old really affects a persons capability of being rational. There are times when he panicks and freaks out about things that are completely trivial, and me being the way I am I kind of just let him do his thing and sometimes I ask him “why are you freaking out?” And he always has a sharp response. I don’t often take insults personally but when he says stupid BS I still get extremely annoyed. The difference in my attitude is probably noticeable, but I don’t really freak out in response to him freaking out as that would only send us down a whirlpool of bickering like a married couple. I usually just talk less. For example, he was cooking a couple slabs of salmon and he asked me if I knew where the olive oil is, I suggested three different spots it might be and he still couldn’t find it, but I didn’t physically help him find it.  Well he still found a way to blame me for the missing olive oil. He always tells me to “be careful not to break this or that” or “don’t lose this or that” and he thinks he has to hold my hand through absolutely everything because it’s my first time on a boat, but the reality is that it doesn’t seem like he knows much more about the job than I do. He has thirty years experience driving a boat, but the specific job we’re doing, not much. He feels the need to walk me through everything. I mean he thought I needed to be taught how to pull a cord on a generator to turn on the engine. What a joke. He makes me out to be an idiot he doesn’t trust me with anything and he treats me like a liability, an expense. On top of that, his word is worthless. Anything he says he is going to do, you can pretty much count on him to do the opposite. He is a lazy ass procrastinator which directly negatively effects our income. I only have to deal with him for another couple of months but how do I stoically arrange my thoughts to deal with this senile air head? I am trying to learn as much as I can from him but it’s hard to take him seriously when he’s worried about the most trivial BS in the world and not actually doing the job we came for… at this point I just want to finish the contract and find another job and never look back. But how do I think about this until then to ease my mind? Im tired of resenting him for being who he is. I have tried just being ok with him being a man child, but it’s still irritating me. Do I just continue to remind myself that it’s okay that he’s stupid I just have to pretend he has more to teach me, and maybe I’ll learn something?

Is stoicism anti-life?/ why do stoics do anything?,"I do not consider myself a stoic but I am familiar with the writings of Aurelius, Epictetus and the like. I study greaco-roman philosophy as a whole and stoicism is an essential part of it. I like stoicism and I look for ways to apply it practically in my life but I can't bring myself to commit to it.
Stoicism I find is too extreme. If stoics believe that the only thing that is good in life is pursuing virtue by living according to nature, and this is done by denying assent to impressions then why do they do anything? Isn't literally everything an impression? Why don't stoics just sit in bed and starve to death? Isn't food and hunger an impression? If you commit wholly to stoicism then what would motivate you to do anything?
I can't shake the feeling that stoicism is really a form of avoidance. You can keep yourself from feeling pain by pretending you don't care about life, but you also rob yourself of love, pleasure, passion and all the things that make life worth living. 
Aurelius says we should be indifferent to our family because they're mortal. But if my brother died right now I would be devastated, I would want to be devastated because I love him. Seneca says we should be indifferent to our bodies, but the body is a beautiful thing. You claim to follow nature but you disregard the body? One of the most complex and amazing works of art that nature has ever produced. If the body is worthless then why don't we just die right now?
Perhaps stoicism could be used as a survival mindset. Good for people who have no choice but to make massive sacrifices just to stay alive, but for everyday life it's too much.
I'm not bashing stoicism, although I do find it frustrating. I am open to the possibility that I am gravely mistaken over some area of the doctrine. If anyone could enlighten me it would be greatly appreciated.",Stoicism,1681155464.0,t3_12htjpv,0.41,0
Managing a crush in a Stoic way," So to contextualize a bit, a year ago I broke up with my boyfriend back then, although it had been a great relationship the break up was quite hurtful. Nevertheless, once the pain was over I really went through a glow-up season: I experienced an increase in self-esteem, confidence and was just incredibly well with my mind and body. It was at this point that I started learning about stoicism and overall, that period came with a great amount of personal growth. I learnt how to be with myself fully and really started enjoying my company and independence.   


As a consequence, I think I also started attracting some nice people into my life, one of whom was a very cute guy that had lots of traits that I identified were missing in my past relationship. Blinded by this fact (and due to some personal circumstances) we both rushed into a relationship. As you can imagine, this was not the best decision I could have taken. I was at a stage where I was enjoying being single and everything that came with a  relationship kind of collided with my priorities at that moment. As soon as I was aware of all of this, we broke up the short relationship. And that brings me to the present. My idea after the break-up was to give me that alone time I was craving, however, for the past week I have been crushing with a friend of mine. 

On the one hand, it is a recent (and most likely) ephemeral crush so I am rationalizing it. Although I am 70% certain it is reciprocal I think I don't want to act on it. Firstly, it could destabilize the amazing friendship we already have. But my real fear is making the same mistake as with this recent short relationship: stepping into something while not being emotionally prepared to do so.

I am reaching out to you because I need some help navigating and processing these feelings under a stoic framework. Should I have a conversation with him explaining my situation and why I am not gonna act according to my crush-feelings towards him? How can I digest this while being compassionate and non-judgemental to myself?",Stoicism,1679829761.0,t3_122j5up,0.61,4
How to deal with Non-verbal Abuse?,"So I live with my parents and both are narcissists. After some research, I found out how I was so brainwashed. I was gaslighted throughout my life and now, as a 21-year-old male, they used to abuse me verbally and say that everything was my fault. They would always attack in a group because they are weak and would attack me in one-on-one arguments. Basically, I was the family scapegoat. But somehow, after reading some quotes from Marcus Aurelius, I tried not to be affected by their abuse. I don't reply to them and basically stay silent and not engage them verbally. I work on my computer every day because I work from home. But they found new ways to push my buttons non-verbally. So, near my computer, there was a refrigerator near me and usually, whenever I worked on my computer, I would get hyper-focused because of my ADHD. They noticed this and would bang the refrigerator door turn by turn to get my attention or control of me. They did this basically every day until I got C-PTSD. Now, whenever I hear loud sounds and fast motion, my body goes into flight mode and reacts to their non-verbal actions. So I moved to another room. And after some days, there was some construction going on near my house. The construction workers noticed how I react to loud sounds, so they and my whole family noticed my movements. If I made any sound while typing or clicking my mouse, they would intentionally make loud noises with things accordingly to my actions rhythm. What can I do here?

>The occult, in the broadest sense, is a category of supernatural beliefs and practices which generally fall outside the scope of religion and science, encompassing such phenomena involving otherworldly agency as mysticism, spirituality, and magic. It can also refer to supernatural ideas like extra-sensory perception and parapsychology.


I have been wondering if Stoicism can be practiced alongside the occult. Are there any passages in the Stoic texts that mention anything related to this? The particular brand of the occult I ascribe to is Thelema.

Would the marketing stoic sentence Socrates to death for valuing virtue and the gods over money gained by marketing?,"Vote this topic down to vote to put Socrates to death.  Vote it up to spare his life.

Socrates addresses the marketing stoic who is concerned with book sales and rankings for their stoicism books which never quote the Stoicism's patron saint Socrates.  Socrates addresses the marketing stoic with, ""Why do you who are a citizen of the great and mighty and wise city of Athens, care so much about laying up the greatest amount of money and honor and reputation, and so little about wisdom and truth and the greatest improvement of the soul, which you never regard or heed at all? Are you not ashamed of this?""  How come the marketing stoic never contemplates the stars nor physics nor poetry nor the virtue of the soul?

As the modern marketing books put Socrates to death, Socrates addresses them coolly and calmly, like a stoic:
""Strange, indeed, would be my conduct, O men of Athens, if I who, when I was ordered by the generals whom you chose to command me at Potidaea and Amphipolis and Delium, remained where they placed me, like any other man, facing death; if, I say, now, when, as I conceive and imagine, God orders me to fulfil the philosopher's mission of searching into myself and other men, I were to desert my post through fear of death, or any other fear; that would indeed be strange, and I might justly be arraigned in court for denying the existence of the gods, if I disobeyed the oracle because I was afraid of death: then I should be fancying that I was wise when I was not wise. For this fear of death is indeed the pretence of wisdom, and not real wisdom, being the appearance of knowing the unknown; since no one knows whether death, which they in their fear apprehend to be the greatest evil, may not be the greatest good. Is there not here conceit of knowledge, which is a disgraceful sort of ignorance? And this is the point in which, as I think, I am superior to men in general, and in which I might perhaps fancy myself wiser than other men, - that whereas I know but little of the world below, I do not suppose that I know: but I do know that injustice and disobedience to a better, whether God or man, is evil and dishonorable, and I will never fear or avoid a possible good rather than a certain evil. And therefore if you let me go now, and reject the counsels of Anytus, who said that if I were not put to death I ought not to have been prosecuted, and that if I escape now, your sons will all be utterly ruined by listening to my words - if you say to me, Socrates, this time we will not mind Anytus, and will let you off, but upon one condition, that are to inquire and speculate in this way any more, and that if you are caught doing this again you shall die; - if this was the condition on which you let me go, I should reply: Men of Athens, I honor and love you; but I shall obey God rather than you, and while I have life and strength I shall never cease from the practice and teaching of philosophy, exhorting anyone whom I meet after my manner, and convincing him, saying: O my friend, why do you who are a citizen of the great and mighty and wise city of Athens, care so much about laying up the greatest amount of money and honor and reputation, and so little about wisdom and truth and the greatest improvement of the soul, which you never regard or heed at all? Are you not ashamed of this? And if the person with whom I am arguing says: Yes, but I do care; I do not depart or let him go at once; I interrogate and examine and cross-examine him, and if I think that he has no virtue, but only says that he has, I reproach him with undervaluing the greater, and overvaluing the less. And this I should say to everyone whom I meet, young and old, citizen and alien, but especially to the citizens, inasmuch as they are my brethren. For this is the command of God, as I would have you know; and I believe that to this day no greater good has ever happened in the state than my service to the God. For I do nothing but go about persuading you all, old and young alike, not to take thought for your persons and your properties, but first and chiefly to care about the greatest improvement of the soul. I tell you that virtue is not given by money, but that from virtue come money and every other good of man, public as well as private. This is my teaching, and if this is the doctrine which corrupts the youth, my influence is ruinous indeed. But if anyone says that this is not my teaching, he is speaking an untruth. Wherefore, O men of Athens, I say to you, do as Anytus bids or not as Anytus bids, and either acquit me or not; but whatever you do, know that I shall never alter my ways, not even if I have to die many times.

Stoa Basics,"When we talk about our school, we have to answer four basic questions:
1.Why do I invest my time in discussing Stoa?
2.What is Stoa?
3.Why is the real essence of the system reduced to profane bonmots?
4.What should I do if I want to become a real Stoic?
1.Why do I invest my time in discussing Stoa?
The result of almost all human activity is dependent on the original motivation of the agent. The result of every mental effort will differ if the basic motivation is a sort of intellectual exhibitionism and desire for appearing smart or a genuine striving for profound understanding about: why do we exist, what is the coordinate system of our existence and what does this mean for our life-forming. The latter motivation needs a very strong impulse, mostly initiated by feeling pain.
It is pretty shallow and amateurish to assume after reading a little bit of Epictetus, a little bit of Lucius Annaeus Seneca or Marcus Aurelius Antoninus to possess at least some decent knowledge about the doctrine. This is the same as assuming being a physicist by reading a couple of articles about quantum physics in a popular journal.
2.What is Stoa?
Stoa is the science of living and dying well. Science is the ordered sum of cognitive impressions (systema ek katalepseon as the Greeks would say) serving a final end in life, in our case – the happy life. Stoa is NOT an original encapsulated system but the pinnacle of development of millennia old human thought in the form of an ordered and coherent doctrine explaining: a) the functioning of the Universe and its principles; b) the functioning of the human being; c) the resulting implications about human activity, both internal and external.
The roots of our ‘systema’ are to be sought in pre-dynastic Egyptian times (the concept of Ma’at) and Sumeric Me with analogues in Aryan pre-philosophic beliefs which can be spotted for example in the Rigveda. This knowledge evolved throughout the millennia and by students of ancient wisdom like Linus and Orpheus reached Greece. It survived the Dark Ages and blossomed out in Ionia, Greece proper and the Greek colonies in Italy during the 7th to the 3rd centuries BCE and was shaped by men like Alkman, Pherecydes, Acusilaus, Hermotimus, Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes, Pythagoras, Hippasus, Xenophanes, Heraclitus, Epicharmus, Parmenides, Melissus, Empedocles, Philolaus, Archytas, Ecphantus, Anaxagoras, Protagoras, Democritus, Archelaus, Diogenes of Apolonia, Hippocrates, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Antisthenes, Diogenes of Synope, Krates, Theletos, Kercides, Demonakt, Oenomaus. During the Hellenistic Period many schools tried to sum up the ancient knowledge in a system but only Zeno of Citium and Chrysippus of Soli succeeded in shaping a system which is comprehensive, coherent and free of contradictions. Yes, the Stoa is the crowning jewel of millennia old development of human thought.
It is a highly sophisticated and complicated doctrine explaining on the basis of principles and definitions, how the Universe developed, what laws it abides, how it moves and to what end, in how far is the activity of entities within the Universe predetermined and to what degree. The doctrine explains the structure of the human soul, its attributes and functioning and defines the valuation basis for determining the essence of things in life.
What is NOT Stoa:
It is wrong to reduce our school to some practical advice. This profanization is insofar counterproductive as without the knowledge about the fundamental dogmata, advice is bound to fail at one moment or another. As Lucius Annaeus Seneca says: “Advice is not teaching; it merely engages the attention and rouses us, and concentrates the memory, and keeps it from losing grip. But it is a feeble thing unless it is derived from general principles – that is, unless it is based upon knowledge of the actual dogmata of philosophy and its main headings. For precepts will be of no avail while the mind is clouded with error; only when the cloud is dispersed will it be clear what one’s duty is in each case.”
And: the system is not closed. The men of ancient time left us plenty of stuff to dissect, analyze and explain. It is not for consumers but for true sportsmen and soldiers. In order to excel you need to apply the dogmata in your everyday life. But one is for sure: if you embrace with your whole heart this wisdom, you will never again encounter pain, fear, disappointment; you will be protected in all matters, against every spear of Fortune.
3.Why is the real essence of the system reduced to profane bonmots?
There are following main reasons:
The doctrine in itself is complicated and demands outstanding intellectual abilities. The next difficulty: not a single work from the Old Stoa and from the Presocratic philosophers has survived. What remained are, at least concerning our Stoics, mostly quotations in works of mostly hostile commentators living many centuries later. These quotations were summed up by Hans von Arnim about a century ago in his Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta. Unfortunately the quotations are in Greek and Latin, so only a very limited circle has an access to them. And these who have read them up to now either a) have no ‘right’ motivation and/or b) lack sufficient overview and abilities to reconstruct the teaching in its entirety and/or c) are so “polluted” by their environment that they strive in reality for things diametrically opposed to our dogmata.
4.What should I do if I want to become a real Stoic?
First and foremost: you must analyze honestly and in detail the person you are now. Then make acquaintance with the basic dogmata of our system. You should weigh up all influences in your life and decide whether you want to become a man like Zeno and Chrysippus or not. It does not mean that you are bad, stupid or a coward if you decide you are not born to be one of us. But if you decide that it is your destiny to be a Stoic, then you should show resolution and firmness of spirit and follow your dogmata even in the face of death. And what is the promise? You will gain a life of reason, a life of freedom, a life of eternal tranquility and a life of mastery – the mastery over your own self.

I had one moment where I acted weird in March and I thought we talked about it in detail since then. But last time I saw her she didn't really want to be around me. When I left that's when she sent me the breakup message. Before I had even touched down.


I just feel stupid, hurt and embarrassed because it has been YEARS since I even attempted to invest as much of my emotions into someone. I have been dating other women since. Some that have even showed major attraction towards me. But I still feel like shit. I feel like an idiot, a loser, less of a man, unattractive, embarrassed. I've been getting high everyday to try to push it in the back of my head but it hurts. I hate how I feel.

 I've been trying to meditate, work on mindfulness but none of that is working. So I've been reading about stoicism lately and have been wondering how I could use it to get over these feelings.

i’m in a state i can’t come out of.,"i don’t know what to do. It seems life just isn’t even worth it anymore. I hold back some of what i want to say so i won’t get reported. But at this point i’m just very deeply depressed. As a 20 yo i honestly hate myself and how my life is. I’ve gotten myself addicted to porn and weed. I have zero friends. I have no social circle. I barely make enough money to even think about saving because i have all these bills which keeps getting higher and higher. I just don’t know what to do. I hate this city (Memphis) and honestly i hate this country. Now i literately only see porn weed and junk food as a crutch or escape. I’ve went on sprees of self improving. Like doing pushups….even had went to the gym for 3 days (there was a free pass)
Today i realized that watching all this self improvement is making me feel worse without me even realizing it…thanks healthygamergg. Also i’ve been beating my self esteem up with these dating apps. I’ve only done it so long because last year this time i met my ex who was my first/last gf. It’s been a year now. She reached out checked up on me and ended up blocking me after i said “thanks i’ll keep that in mind” when she said…”you never use your handsome profile pics. I go around seeing the places she’s taken me and i feel a sinking feeling in my heart. Apparently i wasn’t a good enough guy for her to post on her tik tok when we dated….even though there’s like three others. I just feel like a crumb honestly. Especially to women….i don’t even want to continue talking about women. I’m tired of talking about women….i want to talk TO women but it seems impossible. That dating app was the only intereaction i had with them. I would be lucky if i even got a RESPONSE to whatever i would send…it was hinge btw. I knew they gave like 8 free likes and i could comment something so i would spend time tryna say something and get ignored for months and occasionally some would reply but then ghost and unmatch. 

Today just seems to be going horrible for me. I tried quitting za but failed again. Probably gonna relapse to porn when i put this phone down and “go to bed” then wake up “ smoke some apple…yes actually apple…if you know you know.

I know i have so much more to offer. I want to be able to make cool cars and stuff. I’ve been so interested in this program called blender where i make 3D cars. I used to be like top tier at drawing cars. It’s like something everyone knows me for. They don’t know about the porn addict or the drug addict. Or the guy who can’t talk to girls or no friends. 


I even went to a car show today by myself  because i was attempting to at least do something out of the house and it just made me feel worse.

Is participating in this community enabling Reddit’s greed?,"This is my first post here but I’ve been a member of the community for months and I love it. This community has taught me a lot about Stoicism and I’m looking forward to learning a lot more!

Reddit has changed. Like most users I was cautiously optimistic about Reddit’s going public but I’m afraid the worst has happened. They have prioritized share holder profits over the communities that made Reddit what it is in the first place. 

What the shareholders want is money and if enough communities abandon Reddit for their recent changes they will lose money and shareholders will then be incentivized to pay attention to what the users want I.e. we could get a seat at the table for decision making. If they don’t have the option but to pay attention to our needs then they will have to. Makes sense right? It’s how all strikes work lol.

In defense of Cold Showers! and why they really ARE Stoic!,"Yesterday I posted in this sub on the benefits of cold showers. This was met with many misjudged misinterpretations of my original point, which I feel has been taken out of context. I have gone away to think and here is an answer as to why this IS **stoicism in action**. I was shocked to see so many 'upset' individuals over something as insignificant as cold water exposure... It also confused me as to how so many queried why it was posted in a Stoicism sub, asking, ""How does this relate to stoicism?"" and questioning my own understanding of the subject... despite my own deeply held understanding that this is a meditation on living stoically; nothing more, nothing less. It is my personal opinion that to really understand a great mystery, one must throw oneself into it and learn firsthand, rather than 'bitch' from a place of comfort. That said, I have read the comments and believe the following sums up why **cold showers really ARE Stoic**. This is the last I will say on the matter. Many were questioning my reasons for posting; some suggesting it was ego-massaging. I admit that the vernacular of the post was something of a 'call to arms', but believe me... when stepping into ice cold water, you need something to rouse the spirit in my experience and it was simply what I say to myself and what works for me. If the post can work for someone else who needs that same 'call to arms' to get their life in order in some small way, stepping into discomfort, then I have done what I intended to. For those whom it rings true, find more on my own sub where we will discuss and learn The Way r/Samuraimindset. For those who still take issue with this, then it is simply not for you and I wish you well in your own education on the great Stoics...

&#x200B;

Let’s start with the dynamic of desire and aversion. Human beings, as well as animals, make a discernment between the things they like and don’t like. This mechanism is valuable for survival: avoiding certain things that are life-threatening can literally save our lives. That’s why zebras avoid lions, and also why I avoid standing in the middle of a fire. 

However, So often people avoid a simple discomfort that isn’t life-threatening, but, actually, *necessary* for personal growth. If we always avoid the things we averse, we’ll never be able to achieve certain goals. If we want a muscular body, we need to go to the gym. If we want to be heard, we need to speak up. But what holds us back? The fear of discomfort.

**Here is a quote from Stoic philosopher and statesman Seneca:**

***It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare, but because we do not dare, things are difficult.*** 

***Seneca,*** [***Moral Letters To Lucilius***](https://amzn.to/2Vf4J4N)***, 26***

*In other words:* if we want things to become easier, we should become braver. This is where cold showers come in.

I think that most people are quite averse to cold showers, since most of them are used to hot streaming water at home, which makes bathing rather a comforting and soothing experience than a refreshing and invigorating one. Thus, in general, people that are used to bathing in warm water will avoid the discomfort of cold showers.

**Here’s a quote from Stoic philosopher Epictetus:**

***Remember that following desire promises the attainment of that of which you are desirous; and aversion promises the avoiding that to which you are averse. However, he who fails to obtain the object of his desire is disappointed, and he who incurs the object of his aversion wretched.***

***Epictetus,*** [***Enchiridion***](https://amzn.to/2ybMcNG)***, 2***

End quote. In this context, the idea behind taking cold showers is that we deliberately expose ourselves to what we averse. We might desire nice, warm water on our skin, but we give ourselves the opposite instead. By doing this, we train ourselves in becoming more resilient towards the things we do not like. It creates a mindset of *acknowledging not liking something and doing it anyway.* The more we do this, the less wretched we’ll be when incurring what we averse.

Ancient Roman emperor and [Stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDVYjnosumiBpWeHOB_f3cAniD3FPmFFe) advised us to engage in the [Praemeditatio Malorum](https://youtu.be/AYhlVwy8C6E) (translated: *negative visualization)* in the morning, to prepare ourselves for the adversity we could meet during the day ahead.

*When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can’t tell good from evil.*

***Marcus Aurelius,*** [***Meditations***](https://amzn.to/3a9rVpo)***, 2-1*** 

Now, when visualising adversity is a cognitive way to brace ourselves for pain, taking a cold shower can be considered a negative visualization in action, that prepares us for the difficulties that the day will bring. Because we’ve already faced one demon by taking a cold shower, the threshold of facing other demons becomes lower.

By taking cold showers we train ourselves to just ‘go for it’ when confronted with a potentially painful experience, no matter how much anxiety we experience. Examples of such experiences are telling someone bad news or a difficult confrontation at work. The cold shower teaches us that, no matter how dreadful something is at first; when we push through we will adapt and it will become bearable. 

Some hardships may be excruciating at first, but after a while they become integrated and we suffer a lot less. I kind of dread public speaking for example. But I’ve learned that, like a cold shower, the beginning is the worst, and when I’m a few minutes in, the discomfort goes away. 

The ability to push through anxiety means that fear won’t stop you, no matter how terrible it feels. This way, we will open doors that we previously didn’t dare to open. And by opening those doors we find pathways to new possibilities because we have liberated ourselves from the chains of fear.

The experience with cold showers learns us to *trust* that we *will* cope, even when our minds tell us the opposite.

*Courage* is a Stoic virtue. Taking cold showers is a way to *build* courage, by conquering ourselves in the face of discomfort, instead of going down the easy road.

Cold showers are small daily victories over pain, and function as a metaphor for how we approach our daily confrontations with the things we averse, which are, whether we like it or not, part of our existence as human beings.",Stoicism,1675720108.0,t3_10vj96p,0.56,2
I walk among pigs.,"The new guy came to work feeling sick, he hopped he would get better, he got worse, he's sitting on a corner with his mask. Everyone is avoiding him because it can be Covid, the guy is nervous because his wife is pregnant, and covid and pregnancy donigo well together.

We work 30 minutes away from the city, so whenever someone needs to leave early or late, they call a cab.

Come back to the guy, he says he can wait, asks for medicine though, there's none, so I thought of a guy a work with who's always handing people pills when they need it, he says ""oh no, tell him I don't have it, I could get in trouble for medicating him""

Some rambling I wanted to share.,"I began my journey with epictetus enchiridion and now moved to the discourses which have been quite an experience. I come to the conclusion that what I formerly known or read on stoicism pages like the ones on here are highly flawed and even contrarian to the original teachings. Esecially in the relation to violence and stepping up for yourself as I see people falsely idolizing being a doormat and yes passive with the excuse its just an indifferent. Usually that gets twisted in the other way as people say be indifferent in the wrong sense to those things like defending yourself or protecting your honor but then suddenly for certain other indifferents like they bring this smart saying yeah but what is really meant with indifference is to not be indifferent to indifferents but have a certain double standard in relation to ""uncomfortable things"" like said self defense or violence itself so I come around very weird posts some older some more recent while randomly lurking about people feeling very stoic because they let themselves beaten up humiliated or let that happen to others and I dont think that this behaviour is stoic or virtuous and rather cowardly and vicious. I think a good example can be found in discourses 4.10 called What we should despise and what should we especially value? There Epictetus specifically talks about correct action or practice in the real world using the example of Hercules the graecoroman demigod who is like the idol of what a stoic should be and he certainly was absolutely not opposed to violence even bordering real savagery at times. To quote the passage ""What would Heracles have been if he had said, ´How can I prevent a huge lion from coming my way, or a huge boar, or a savage man?´ If a huge boar comes along, the contest that you engage in will be all  the greater, if wicked men come along, you´ll rid the world of wicked men.´ ´But what if I should die in doing so ?´ You´ll die as a good person, accomplishing a noble deed.

I am quite sure that one shouldnt necessarily take it only literally and I dont think it is intended to be so but in no way is it also just intended to be taken as a pure metaphor with the beasts being generally hardhips of life like illnesses or other unpleasant stuff and especially the last part referring to wicked men seems to be very literally meant though of course considering the time the danger of wild animals like boars and lions was quite present as well in a very literal sense. Also I think it shows that this philosophy apart from the cosmopolitian view is very elitist and ""judgy"" not in a hateful sense of course but rather in a way to educate and Epicetus does this quite often and may I say generously?

In no way do I propose brainless violence or taking enjoyment in hurting others but rather I want to throw this in here as I believe that that may help some people understanding and applying stoicism better as the ancient philosophy it is and not as the shallow self help hippie formula it has become in my view. So yeah what do you think? Have I misunderstood it? I have to be honest I suspect many people will dislike and dismiss that as they will say thats lower case stoicism or broicsm dude, thats not what what Stoicism is about its about social justice and lgtbq rights dude but I dont care about those things as I think that is equally wrong and stupid like those sites who say how to become a quadtrillionaire with stoicism in 3 weeks lol",Stoicism,1638279272.0,t3_r5nefd,0.5,0
Do you find Stoicism to be True? Does Stoicism transform?,"Do you find Stoicism to be true or do you use it to cope? I'd like to see the lives of the people who call themselves Stoics. All the best people I look at who live good lives would not fall in the category of Stoic.

I wonder if sayings like ""Pain is inevitable, suffering is a choice"" is actually true or if it is just pleasing to hear and comforting to the soul. Even falsehoods can be pleasing to hear and truth can be difficult to bear.

If you take away the extravagance of Stoic literature, what you get is Aristotelian virtue ethics and Platonic philosophy. That classical though seems to be at odds with the modern thought paradigm. 

On a personal, spiritual and intellectual level do you think it's true? I have just not met anyone who has shown how Stoicism has transformed their lives. Most people I see how get into Stoicism have just begun or are at least a work in progress.

I think stoicism is wrong and you should be effected by outside events,"Reason be, my friend in highschool used to be very overweight. he was bullied for it which caused/convinced him to lose weight so he was not made fun of by other people anymore. If he followed the stoic guidelines of ""not caring what others think"" then he might have not cared what people thought and continued to live his unhealthy lifestyle. But because he cared what others thought of him he changed his lifestyle.

I have another example as well. At work I was working with someone who didn't speak English very well, up to the point where it was slowing the business down and causing problems. Eventually i got annoyed, told the manager and she moved her position to somewhere else. Now the work environment has much less tension and runs smoother.

Is stoicism actually compatible with human nature?,"I've done a lot of reading in psych/neuroscience, from very esoteric philosophical guys like Carl Jung to uncompromisingly atheistic guys like Richard Dawkins and Stephen Pinker.

Obviously we can use our PFC to exercise will power and things like psychedelics and advanced stages of meditation both show that a radical transformation in how the mind works, even only a temporary one, is beyond doubt at this point.

Still, i have my doubts if Stoicism can ever be more than an idealistic set of tennets about how people should be which can be imitated, acted out, but can't ever authentically change who you are inside and what you feel.

I mean I'd like to believe it's true because we all have extremely fucked up things happen to us and with todays SJWs talking about ""toxic masculinity"" the virtue of emotional strength, stoicism, is under attack more than ever.

I have been busy. My interest in Stoicism is summed up by an article that I've just

Here is the abstract:

>In this article I briefly present the case that Stoic natural philosophy 
>provides the missing meta-language to finally make sense of 
>quantum mechanics. Modern Stoic writers such as Lawrence C Becker 
>dismiss Stoic physics as an embarrassment. Becker tries to cobble

>oxymoron if ever there was one. To Chrysippus, the very core of ethics 
>arises from the fundamental physical principles of matter. If Stoic

I would be interested in your comments. Please feel free to pass this on to your 
more technically inclined friends to get their comments too.
So far I've written a 450 page book The First Science and the Generic Code which 
has not been reviewed as yet (be the first!). The book has a heavy and constant 
Stoic theme. Some readers have told me that they have read it cover to cover half 
a dozen times or more but this has not lead to a wider audience as yet. This is 
probably because it is self-published and I lack time for promotion. I have a 
second book in the pipeline.

I have also written a number of papers that can be found on my website.
 All centre around Stoic logic as a blueprint for an alternative but complementary 
paradigm  for the foundations of science. 
The most significant is entitled 
[The Universal Geometric Algebra of Nature:Realising Leibniz's Dream]( http://www.thefirstscience.org/current-papers/)
Here is the abstract:

>Many researchers in the field of Geometric Algebra claim it to be the 
>universal language of mathematics and physics and so realise 
>Leibniz's vision. Their claim has some merit. However, Leibniz's 
>geometry without number vision was much more ambitious. For 
>example, Leibniz claimed that the geometry would explain the forms 
>of plants and animals 'in a few letters.' Since the discovery of the 
>genetic code, we now know such a code indeed does exist. However, 
>Geometric Algebra makes no reference to the genetic code, the truly 
>authentic algebra of Nature. In this paper we work closely with 
>Leibniz's core concepts, together with a strong Stoicism influence, and 
>show how his approach to metaphysics and geometric algebra can be 
>made tractable. The end result is a geometric algebra based on a 
>four-letter alphabet. The four letters are shown to correspond to the 
>geometric semantics of timelike, lightlike, spacelike, and singular 
>vectors of a geometric algebra. We propose an exact mapping of 
>these four generic letters to those of the genetic code. Thus, the 
>genetic code is interpreted as expressing generic geometric 
>organisation based on a Leibniz style geometric algebra rather than 
>being a mere transcription code as stated in the Central Dogma of 
>biochemistry..

>The overall picture presented here is that of metaphysics playing the 
>role of an operational science much like Heaviside's Operational 
>Calculus does in providing the much simpler synchronic alternative to 
>the traditional analysis of time series. Like Leibniz, we claim that this 
>new operational approach to science and philosophy can explain not 
>just the generic forms of the animate, but also the inanimate.

Unlike in my early days before I moved away from purely technical and quite 
orthodox papers, I am having trouble getting my work published. I submitted the 
above paper to the Foundations of Science journal, together with a proposed list 
of what I thought were ten of the world top people in their field. The paper was 
not accepted but the long referee comments were interesting. One of the kinder 
referees wrote in his long set of comments:

>The paper is very ambitious. It is, in short, an attempt to mathematize 
>metaphysics, to find the universal mathematical code that underlies 
>all being. But in attempting to explain so much, it runs close to not 
>explaining much at all. The one application the author gives, the 
>explanation of the preferred chirality of living organisms, is not very 
>convincing. 

He then goes on to say that the paper ""could be a game changer, but.."" In a later 
paper that I am rewriting, I do provide the missing  areas of application and so do 
not despair.

In the Paper I am writing at the moment, I am just blown away by the hidden 
subtleties in Chrysippus' Stoic logic. My ambitious project is reaching fruition. 
Maybe you will be able to say that you read about it first here!
Note that my work is not a scholarly approach to Stoicism and so may conflict 
with certain established orthodoxies. I appreciate the forensic work of the 
scholars, but my approach is to reverse engineer Stoicism from first principles.  I 
try to follow the line of Chrysippus. As he said to Cleanthes, ""Give me the dogmas and I will 
find the proofs.""

As a final note, as one can see you need to be very Stoic in more ways than one to 
work for so long and so alone on this kind of project!
Best wishes to all.

"Someone I looked up to told me to ""literally rot in hell"", instead of lashing out I moved on.","I got covid two weeks ago and posted on my private story ""I love having covid this is the happiest I've been in weeks"", because I live in an abusive household and for the first time in a long time they got to leave me alone. A lot of people miss-interpreted what i was saying and subtweeted me on twitter. One of my close friends even said something snarky about it, but I made an effort to talk it out with her to preserve the relationship. 

My best friend (let's call her emma) told me that this other girl, laura, was really mad about what i said and Emma would not go into specifics about what Laura was saying. Laura is a grade older than me and I always thought she was super cool and I really wanted to get to know her better. Emma told me that Laura was ranting on her private story so she did not get the whole thing but I could tell she was holding back. Because she was not being upfront with me I knew there was more to the story and I instantly got really triggered and I struggle with self harm so I decided I was going to self harm that night because I was so upset. Later I asked my friend Emma what Laura said again in hopes I would get a forward answer and Emma said it was on Laura's twitter. I looked everywhere for this girl's twitter and when I found it I saw that she made a tweet that said that I should ""literally rot in hell"" for getting covid and being happy about it. She also unfollowed me on all of my socials which obviously hurt because I wanted to maintain a relationship with her. I spent the next half an hour crying really hard and self harming, but I realized that I don't have control over what Laura thinks or feels and I should not waste time blaming myself. I had cut deeper tonight then I ever had and I just wanted to keep going which scared me. So instead, I went on a really intense run and put on music really loud in my headphones.

Why do I get a longer life than others?,"I think of so many celebrities who died at a very young age. Chadwick Boseman, for example who was not only a remarkable actor, but an incredible human being. He passed away from Cancer at 43 i believe. I am currently 46, working at a job thats close to minimum wage. No friends (my choice) , just have my wife. Im very introverted. I don't own a house, or car, or have a licence. I live paycheck to paycheck, and have other mental health issues. So my question is, why would God take away life from people who make a difference in this world, but keep me? I know it sounds like im putting myself down but really, why? I don't seem to have a ""purpose"" in life, yet others did, and their lives were cut short. 

I seem to coast through life, then i hear of good people dying at early stages of life. I haven't done anything to deserve my life. Sometimes i feel like im just existing. Im pretty happy for the most part, but i get up, go to work, come home, go to bed, get up etc.

I work to make a company rich. Thats my life. What do i get? 18 bucks an hour! Gee, sounds great. That means i can't afford any place to live unless my wages magicly go up another $20 bucks an hour! Im not saying i deserve to get Cancer and die, but why does it happen to good people, and people like me get a longer life? Doesn't seem fair.",Stoicism,1695657529.0,t3_16rvz2b,0.68,21
Is it okay to cry as a stoic?,"I have been following stoicism for under 6 months now and I’m aware of some texts regarding this and how crying is essentially a waste of time. I’m becoming better at understanding my emotions and learning not to simply act on them. 

But there are days like today, for whatever reason, where I just feel the desire in me to cry. It feels comparable to when I haven’t masturbated for some time and I simply want a release. Not an emotional release although It could be from a build up of stress from these new ways I’m trying to handle stress since applying stoic philosophy to my life. 

Anyone have any advice? Is it ok to ball for a few minutes and then move on? As always, I appreciate your advice.",Stoicism,1687535268.0,t3_14h1z3k,0.69,23
Ex moving on too quickly.,"I do not want to get into too much details but I just wanted to vent things out. She was my first love. We were in a on-off relationship for 5 years. She breakups with me a lot for a reason like she can't love or ""its not you, its me"" type of shit. I thought she was pretty great as a partner so tho I regret now, I usually am the one that is reaching out to come back together. We usually comeback together after a few months for five years. WE never lasted a year tbh.  
  
We were pretty immature i know but one thing is for certain is that I loved her genuinely. Our last relationship lasted for almost a year. Almost. She wanted to breakup. I didn't accept it at first because i thought she was being impulsive again but after a week I decided to let her go though it was hard. I regret that I begged to her to stay and im cringing rn but we learn from mistakes. No one should beg to be loved. Now, I wasn't the perfect partner. I was needy, obsessive maybe, and overthinker. My mental space got the better of me you know. But I dont give up. Im the type of person that would say ""I dont want to lose you, lets fix things"" but seems like she didn't want that or maybe not from me.  
  
The reason for breaking up this time was a bunch. (1) She fears commitment. We were together a long time but I wasn't given the chance to meet her parents. I wasn't forcing her to let me meet her parents but I find it weird that she seems she doesn't want that. (2) She ""can't"" love again. I know this was her usual reason for breaking up. I can't understand it tho I know i don't have to. (3) She doesn't have the time and space for relationships rn. Tho i find hard to believe because we were together for almost a year and now she just realized this which was weird to me. (4) She just wants to be alone and that she is not happy anymore and she feels like drowning or choking. I respect that reason tbh. When she said that I knew I had to let her go. I wanted her to be happy. In the end (i regret asking rn), in which i asked ""Do you promise once your ready, you'll chose me?"" and she said yes. The relationship ended on good terms. No bad blood. i thought there was a high chance of coming back together again.  
  
After a few months, I started that to went to no contact, work on myself, workout, study, work on my portfolio. It was okay. I was dealing with the breakup much better than I was before. Healthily coping with my pain. It was horrible but i know i got through this before. But its only a matter of time before a painful news get to me.  
  
Recently, My family and I was on vacation. I had a great time. When suddenly my friend chatted and broke the news, that she has a new partner, her classmate (we were in different colleges). I saw her account shes flaunting his new guy all over her social medias. There is this specific picture that shows him in her place which means he met her parents. Its only been 4 months. It was horrible. Like your body just sinks. Like every reason that she wanted to breakup was a lie. The promise was a lie. I wanted to cry but I couldn't cause my family is there with me. I never knew I could experience worse pain than I had before. Like i thought she promised. I thought she was better than that. The thoughts, memories, pain came back. Its like my world shattered you know. Thats when you realize that the world is unfair. It was an unimaginable pain that I've been through. You asked yourself a bunch of questions about your self-worth. ""Was I enough?"", ""Was i too much"". ""Was I not worth the risk or pain?"" I realized that she ended the relationship for the sole reason that she does not love me anymore, and the reasons that she gave was just white lies to cushion the blow that she is going to make .I did my best for her and for the relationship. I wanted her to be happy. I like to think of it as like a game of chess, i did all the possible best moves but in the end I still lost. Hopefully, she is happy now, unfortunately not with me.  
  
Its been a month, and Im feeling better but the pain is still there. Im getting better at dealing with my thoughts. But I believe the worst part is the memories. Songs that will remind you of them. Catchphrases that will remind you of them. Places that will remind you of them. It feels like hell. It HURTS like hell. But I know i cant do anything about it anymore. I feel like I already know what I need to do. Work on myself again. Focus on myself. Emotionally heal from this traumatic experience. I just wanted to vent this out. As a man, its hard to find mediums to freely express your emotions.

I have been using stoicism to cope with my pain. Im sure me feeling pain is my own fault. I expected her to be someone that would not do that. I caused my own pain. Its beyond my control anymore. I would like some quotes that would enlighten and bring me clarity. I would also take some book recommendations as I already finished Mediations by Marcus Aurelius and Discourses by Epictetus.

Giving up on practicing Stoicism after 2 months,"Hey community,

I'm reaching out for support as I navigate through some tough times. At 29, I've recently lost my job and ended a 4-year relationship due to my own lack of discipline. These setbacks have left me feeling uncertain about the future and emotionally overwhelmed.

Facing this dual challenge, I've reached out to some stoic learning resources like articles and vlogs and ended up recognizing that I need to cultivate **Courage** and **Temperance** to tackle the emotional aftermath. 

Over the past two months, I've attempted Stoic exercises such as Journaling, Premeditatio Malorum, and Negative Visualization to find solace and direction. However, I must admit that I've struggled to stay consistent and haven't seen the progress I was hoping for. It's clear that I lack guidance in applying these practices effectively. More importantly, most of the time, I don't feel like I'm applying Stoicism in my life when doing these exercises, but it feels more like boring daily tasks.

Is it hard to live a stoic life in the USA?,"Some background (and don't be offended, which maybe you would):

I am originally from Hungary. For those that don't know, it has a thousand years old culture stemmed in nomadic lifestyle, wars, and creative adaptability in extreme measures, it lost two world wars, 70 percent of its land, and then was occupied by the Nazies and then by the Soviets for about 45 years -both of whom did genocides- and had to pay war reparations, had the highest inflation in human history, and had about 5-6 revolutions and changes of state form in a century, and now is being ruled by a corrupt regime. And people live their lives.

I decided about 4 years ago, that I will soon move the USA to live the American dream. For that to make money, I worked in a Scandinavian country, where I started to somewhat doubt that I want to live around people who are not cold, stoic, and non-problematic in the Nordic way. I know personally many American people very closely, and even lived with them.

My concern is that maybe not only Western people cannot take life seriously, but they even pull others into this non-serious approach, and their lives are full of noise, sugar, air conditioner, lukewarmness, and many has a physique, intelligence and communicational style not compatible with normal human survival, and they are sometimes so entitled that they get offended by the existence of another person, or by somebody having an opinion that they label as ""not nice"". And they always ask ""how are you"", and deep and personal questions in situations where there is no place for that, and they expect you to give a shallow and indifferent anwser regarding your own life.

On the other hand, I love freedom, I am a very risk-taking and innovative person, and I like to create value while nobody is trying to use force on me, and I have a big dream of building up a business and having a nice and big family in the USA and live the American dream.

I made an inappropriate joke to someone and their reply was hurtful. How do I subvert my expectations of being apologized to?,"This is a fake scenario based off of a real problem I'm having.

I'm confused in how to feel and how to respond to they way someone reacted to a joke I made.

So let's say I, Jack, made a joke about vegans to my friend Mark, who is not a vegan but has told me previously that they don't like jokes at the expense of vegans.

After telling my joke, Mark said ""shut up, that's offensive"".

Now, upon reflection I realized that I made a mistake. There's no doubt in my mind that the initial mistake was mine. However I still feel hurt due to being told to shut up.

I have apologized for making the joke, and Mark hasn't apologized for his response. I feel like I expect him to apologize. Should I not?

This is something which isn't yet clear to me in the stoic teachings. I lack ""the wisdom to know the difference"". I know his apology is out of my control, but should (or could) I tell him that it was hurtful and that I would like if he doesn't do it again?

Or do I just change my expectations to such a degree in which I won't expect to be treated with any respect?

The Joy of Marriage and child rearing should be experienced by us Stoic Practitioners.,"A passage from the book “A Guide to the Good Life - The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy” by William B. Irvine (pg. 140-141), tells us of marriage while quoting Musonius Rufus. 

“A wise man, Musonius says, ‘will marry, and having married, he and his wife will work hard to keep each other happy. Indeed, in a good marriage, two people will join in a loving union and will try to outdo each other in the care they show for each other. Such a marriage, one imagines, will be very happy. And having married, a wise man will bring children into the world. No religious procession’, Musonius says, ‘is as beautiful as a group of children guiding their parents through the city, leading them by the hand and taking care of them. Few people’, Musonius would have us believe, ‘are happier than the person who has both a loving spouse and devoted children.’”

Let us find that person who loves us, and who we love in return. A partnership embodied by virtue. What could aid more in your own journey than a good traveling partner? 

Bringing children into the world, educating them, being there for them, sharing in their joys and their failures, becoming old, sending good humans onto the same journey that we ourselves carried all those years, then dying a peaceful death.

How do I step out of this mindset?,"(For context I am 13) Every night I feel like I am the single worst person in the world and that mainly is because of my bad points.
I have this problem that I guarantee you probably only like 1000 people in the entire world have.
So when i was six I was tested on my iq because mom was curious.
The results came back saying my iq was not apprehendable with the kind of tests they have.
The most advanced test has a limit of 162 iq.
They diagnosed me way over that limit.
Because there is no test for over 162, they can’t put on a specific number.
So yeah I’m kinda smarter than Einstein.
Woo yeah fast forward to now, 12- 13 years old and I’m in ninth grade 
I know that having a high iq doesn’t mean you know everything without working for it.
Ever since I was a kid I loved videogames.
I used to play cod bo2 for literally days on end.
So as you could probably imagine, I still love them, but I kinda think it’s solely because of the games that I don’t have the best points in my grade.
I think that if I had never met games I would now be the best in my class (probably the best in my school lmao)
If I’m motivated to learn, I will, but if there is any form of device, I will instantly lose that motivation and look at the device.
My parents also don’t get the intensity of my
( I’ll call it addiction). They kinda help me but it doesn’t affect anything I do. 
*different subject*
So it’s not only about the games, but also about learning itself.
When you are in elementary school, you begin to learn things and get tested on those things, 
I got tested too, but for me it was enough to just pay attention in class, the day after, got a 10/10 (an A+ in America i think)
This went on until now, and I am ashamed to say it, but I have NEVER studied in my life.
Now, my school knows I have this capability, and doesn’t really offer me much help, I mean it’s so hard for me to ‘just use these methods’ like they say because I have never ever done anything like studying in my entire life, that’s why I feel like the worst person in the world, having this much capability and all I do with it is play games.",Stoicism,1617093827.0,t3_mgbfm2,0.62,5

Dumb question: doesn’t stoicism sound like gaslighting to non-stoics?,"We know that a stoic idea is “the thing that was said to you did not cause you pain, but instead your perception of it”. If you were to say something to someone, let’s say it’s something that you did not intend to cause emotional pain, but the person who you said it to has a very strong emotional relationship with the topic and therefore what you say causes them distress (eg. they have a bad mental relationship with their body, and have said they want to lose weight, but if you were to ask them how the weight loss goal is going, it would make them feel shitty and guilty) 

If you were to respond to their reaction with stoic ideas such as “what I said did not hurt you, instead your relationship with your body and your emotional perception of that topic caused you to feel bad”, doesn’t that sound like gaslighting?

I don’t know. It’s one of those things where it’s great if a person discovers it on their own, it’s great and beneficial, but if you someone tells them about it, it’s not helpful (referring to stoicism in general here)

Leg Day,"There once was a horse that followed a road through a mountainway. ""This road sucks"", said the horse. A sheep barreled down a slope like a boulder and, upon contact with a car that was using the road and heading in the opposite direction of the horse, proceeded to explode, sending the ignited car barrelling down the slope on the opposite side of the road from the origination of the sheep's journey, and further down the mountain. Eventually the car, a crushed ball of metal at this point, smacked into a boulder. That boulder belonged to Sisyphus. 

Sisyphus let one rip, and screamed at the same time, because now he had been startled by the impact of the car into his boulder, which was now tumbling down the mountain along with the car which was more or less spherically shaped at this point. The car then hit a sheep, a different sheep than the first one mentioned, and the sheep was very upset for about .053 seconds but then went on about its business, which was trafficking customers from one country into another illegally. The car disintigrated as if in a video game, and pixel by pixel, it vanished from reality. 

Sisyphus and his boulder, on the other hand, were still in a tumble. They eventually stopped at the bottom of the slope, finally, after 36 minutes. Sisyphus pulled himself to his feet, and put his hands on the boulder, but by chance glanced at the ground and spotted a dung beetle with its own boulder made of dung. ""Huh."", said Sisyphus.

Just yelled at my mother.,"Time after time in many different ways I fail stoicism and taoism. I don't know how to be like Epictetus, dude's my hero, and Diogenes is the unachievable guy that I wish to be one day, but they're both light years from me.

To put it simply I don't get along with my mother. Since I was a kid, she's pretty toxic when she wants to. But the last couple of years I've working on it, at least not letting this affect my life. 

I struggled to trust people, mainly women, but I've dealt with that demon, like I did others, most recently I learned not to look for female approval, and stopped clingy to their attention.

As much as I'm improving as a man, my relationship with my mother still sucks. Most of the time is okay, she's loving and caring, but like the devil that she is, from time to time she's the personification of pazuzu.

This time after getting home with a stiff neck (I get too tense from work, and I have a few n
Back problems) she's started criticizing me to the rest of the family. Saying that I do everything my way and that's why I'm like this, because I refused to be healed by her spiritual bullshit.

I later then asked her why she was doing that, I didn't say anything, everything was right. So she as usual with all her devilish might started running her yap. I lost it and started yelling at her.

""why are you doing this, I haven't done anything to you. I never did anything to you""


She then leaves and text me one of those peaceful messages that Grandmas share on WhatsApp.

Honestly, I'm not proud, and none of my heros would be either. I'm just tired of all this push and pull, just like the devil. When she's right in the head, she complains that I'm not loving and ignore her. Wouldn't you despise someone that gives you love and then procedes to slap you?

Someone on the subreddit said that Marcus Aurelius says that you should give your enemies your best. I say fuck him! I sometimes regret not killing her when I was an insecure teenager LOL.

"I know Stoicism is logical, but my mind always points it's all cope, running from the real solution for me","I had an encounter withy landlord yesterday and because of my dyspraxia, I am messy. I struggle to keep a schedule or any habit that is not dopamine inducing.

I feel isolated always in the attacks on me, I know it's just their opinions, but I have a impulse control problem, always did and probably will while I am alive.  The problem is that the people who help me like to corner me and point out how incompetent I am. 

I get angry and say to myself, fuck all of it, I deserve peace in death and not depending on anything or anyone, even my own abilities or inabilities.

You can say I am irrational or anything, but don't we have the right, even though I personally think suicide is not irrational, you don't have to run every possible scenario to see the experiment of me is wrong. 

Even though Stoicism talks about duty, I personally have a duty to myself first to save myself from any bad experiences more than providing good ones, because there was and there will be always more of bad ones.

This is bad by my own judgement, but I don't think I can affect it that much, as long as I remember I was lazy, angry, impulsive, clumsy, asocial and self-isolating. 

This is more of a pessimistic egoism that I have, let's just say if the world does not owe me anything, I don't owe it virtue. I don't remember signing any contract that I must live. Better to lash once and for good on myself and be done with it, than do anything to others if they try anything unvirtous to me or people who don't deserve it.

I really enjoy staying fit and building muscle / toning up, however could this be “unhealthy” or “wrong” in the eyes of the stoics? 

Technically I work out because I enjoy it and I like seeing the progress but subconsciously/consciously I also like doing it because I know other people will find me more “attractive”. 

Therefore, in a way, working out is just another form of pleasing other people or trying to gain attention which the stoics definitely wouldn’t support...

Is Stoicism a Doctrine or Department Store?,"In his insightful comments on my project, www.thestoicguitarist.com, /u/handystoic argued that my approach was more epicurean than stoic. Which got me to thinking about how I approach stoicism and I'd love to hear your thoughts.

I do not approach stoicism as a doctrine or as dogma that must be swallowed whole in order to be used or useful. The disciplines of perception, action and will are VERY useful tools for me. The stoic belief in predestination/predeterminism is NOT something I can really get behind so I don't believe or apply that aspect of it.

This department store approach (buy what you like, leave what you don't), is not dissimilar to how someone like Ryan Holiday thinks about and uses stoicism.

Stoic Vegetarian/Veganism?,"The ancient stoics ask us to see ourselves not just as a member of a specific family, race or nationality but instead as a member of the larger human race. It seems the stoics were very ahead of their time in this kind of thinking and should be congratulated for that. As modern stoics, should we not strive to similarly have a more expansive circle of empathy then is typical for our time. For myself this has become about expanding my circle to be inclusive of all sentient life (for the record I'm definitely not there yet haha). After all, when Orangutans have been shown to recognize their own reflection and can learn to converse with humans in sign language - is the demarcation we create between ourselves and the rest of animals really so clear? Is the suffering of animals really less important than human suffering?

If we choose to expand our circle of empathy in this way I think a logical stoic would begin to see some discrepancies in how we treat our animal brethren in the 21st century. We have chosen a select few to nurture and love as pets but are actively worsening the lives of most others. For me, the worst effects are seen by the species we have chosen to subject to factory farming. It does not seem like the ancient stoics had any particular judgements on the farming or killing of animals that I'm aware of (although if anybody knows of any would be interested to hear). That being said, they lived in a time of small scale farms where the consumption of meat was not optional as it is in developed countries today. And I want to be clear that I am not saying that there is something inherently unstoic about the killing and/or eating of an animal and I believe that in the right context it is justifiable. In my view the torturous lives of factory farm animals is not that context and I think we need to recognize that our continued consumption of meat from these producers is what fuels that injustice.

I think vegetarian/veganism is also an opportunity to practice the stoic virtues. How regulating one's diet helps with moderation probably needs no explanation and there is certainly wisdom and justice in understanding the larger implications of one's lifestyle and taking action to correct it where able. I find that as a lifestyle choice that places you within a minority, vegetarian/veganism definitely strengthens your courage. Courage to stand by your values even when as I've learned there will be ridicule by others.

TL;DR: 
For me part of being a good stoic is being a vegetarian and being a vegetarian makes me a better stoic.

"As a stoic practice, being male, I wore a skirt to school everyday for three weeks","I went through a long process of reasoning before I decided that this was a virtuous thing to do. Looking back now I also realize it was a very stoic thing to do.

First, within myself I recognized a fear of femininity and ""womanliness."" However, this misogyny is an irrational external impression. Why am I afraid of femininity? Why am I afraid of doing something that can be seen as ""female""? Why would I let a piece of cloth threaten my masculinity and sense of identity. If my identity was this fragile then does not it deserve to be shattered?

I realized that if I were to wear a skirt it would help me work through my fear of femininity. It may sound strange but it helped humanize women for me. For a long time, I had a subconscious idea that women are somehow ""different"" than me or ""weaker"" or more ""vulnerable."" I wanted to rid myself of these harmful external impressions. Wearing a skirt made me realize how useless it was to associate feminine clothing with weakness. Women are humans just like me. This helped me understand this not only on a purely rational level but also on a deeper emotional level.

Secondly, I understood that some of my fear also came from the possible social repercussions. It is terrifying to do something like this as it can be social suicide. I worried about the side long looks I would get and the weird comments. I worried about how people would see me.

However consider this [story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Citium) about Zeno from wikipedia: 

>From the day Zeno became Crates’ pupil, he showed a strong bent for  philosophy, though with too much native modesty to assimilate Cynic  shamelessness. Hence Crates, desirous of curing this defect in him, gave  him a potful of lentil-soup to carry through the Ceramicus; and when he  saw that Zeno was ashamed and tried to keep it out of sight, Crates  broke the pot with a blow of his staff. As Zeno began to run off in  embarrassment with the lentil-soup flowing down his legs, Crates chided,  ""Why run away, my little Phoenician? Nothing terrible has befallen  you.

Diogenes writes that Zeno would “...bid men and women wear the same dress and keep no part of the body entirely covered.” [source](https://medium.com/illumination/the-hardest-stoic-spiritual-exercise-and-why-its-crucial-for-happiness-d98b48ea17ad)

According to the Daly Stoic: [""Cato walked around ancient Rome in unusual clothing—with a goal of getting people to laugh at him.""](https://dailystoic.com/cato/)

As we can see, the practice of being indifferent to social repercussions was common among stoics. So therefore, I resolved to do the same thing.

While wearing the skirt, people made weird comments. People gave me sideways glances. I even got laughed at. This quote from the [Enchiridion of Epictetus](http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html) is relevant to the situation:

>Now, for your part, don't  have a supercilious look indeed; but keep steadily to those things which  appear best to you as one appointed by God to this station. For remember  that, if you adhere to the same point, those very persons who at first  ridiculed will afterwards admire you. But if you are conquered by them,  you will incur a double ridicule.

Indeed, many people came to admire me for doing what I did. Now, the admiration was simply a preferred indifferent. Nevertheless, it was nice to have.

I had to keep in mind that many of these people simply had the same inclinations socialized into them as I did. How could I blame them for having this mindset, which I also had. I had to understand that this was inevitable due to the social taboo of men wearing feminine clothing.

Marcus Aurelius states:

>When people injure you, ask yourself what good or  harm they thought would come of it. If you understand that, you'll feel  sympathy rather than outrage or anger. Your sense of good and evil may  be the same as theirs, or near it, in which case you have to excuse  them. Or your sense of good and evil may differ from theirs. In which  case they're misguided and deserve your compassion. Is that so hard? ([source](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1136555-when-people-injure-you-ask-yourself-what-good-or-harm))

The final reason had to do with the social change and benefit I reasoned that this act would give back to my community. I have many friends who are trans or gender non conforming. One of my friends had come out recently and she had started wearing a skirt. For a long time I was uncomfortable with her wearing a skirt. Yet, this was simply an irrational external impression. It was partly a motivation to rid myself of this fear for why I began to wear a skirt. 

However, I also wanted to show support for her. The experience was an uncomfortable and lonely one for her. I reasoned that if more people were to not conform to society's expectations of gender then life would be much better for those who are trans. I knew that doing this would possibly help others who associate with me overcome their own fears around breaking out of the gender binary. I could make people more comfortable with the idea of someone doing this.

I also knew that this would help me understand better the experiences of those who are trans. Now of course, it would be impossible for me to understand this experience completely if I was not trans, yet wearing a skirt helped me consider more some of the difficulties that our friends in the trans community face. If I was able to personally understand and experience a facet of their lives then I could become a better activist. This by no means makes me an ""expert."" Trans people are the experts on their own experiences, however it is a way for me to understand what they go through better.

So to summarize the reasons for why this would be considered virtuous by stoic standards:

1. It helped me rid myself of and examine irrational misogynistic impressions. (A virtue)
2. It helped me become more comfortable with myself, despite what others may think. (A virtue)
3. It gave support to one of my friends. (A virtue)
4. It may have helped others examine their own external impressions and become more rational (positive indifferent)
5. It helped me gain an improved understanding of the outside world and other communities. (A virtue)",Stoicism,1597379913.0,t3_i9fjr5,0.77,275

The Stoics Were Not Philosophers,"---

Excerpted from the 2022 March 21 ""Daily Stoic Email List""

---

We have this notion that philosophers are academics. Although many of the Stoics teachers, this was rarely if ever their actual profession. Across the first five hundred years of Stoic history, its members form an astonishing spectrum of stations in life. They were soldiers and emperors and public servants and merchants and writers, athletes, parents, daughters and diplomats.

The ancients would then influence and inspire many of history’s greats. Theodore Roosevelt brought Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius on his deadly “River of Doubt” expedition. Thomas Jefferson had Seneca on his nightstand when he died. Toussaint Louverture, the leader of the Haitian Revolution, studied Epictetus as he rose up against Napoleon. Beatrice Webb, who helped to found the London School of Economics and who first conceptualized the idea of collective bargaining, called Meditations her “manual of devotion. Admiral James Stockdale relied on Epictetus to get through his hellish time as a POW.

...

It doesn’t matter what you do, where you are from, or what your station in life is, you can join the ranks of some of the great men and women, past and present. “There is no role,” Marcus Aurelius would write, “so well suited to philosophy as the one you happen to be in right now.” The role of parent. The role of spouse. The role of a person waiting in line. The role of a person who has just been given bad news. The role of a person who is rich. The role of a person sent into exile or delivered into bankruptcy. The role of a person who finds themselves enslaved, literally or otherwise. All of these are suited to philosophy. There is no role in which Stoicism does not help one succeed.

"Was in a dangerous situation, looking for assurance/advice","Hello Stoics.

I have a story from earlier this week that's 100% true. I need to know if I handled it well or I should have changed my behavior in case I'm put through this again

I live in San Francisco and I was in a dangerous area at night (the tenderloin iykyk) for a meeting. After this meeting, most people hang outside the building for a few minutes to chat before going to a bar. 

I decided that I wanted a bit of privacy talking to my girlfriend on the phone before heading over. So I walked two blocks away and called her up. There is a group of people (male and female) across the street hanging out. My gf and I were chit-chatting before an initial man comes up to me trying to push. I politely declined.

Then, a few minutes later I hear some heckling coming from across the street. I wasn't sure if it was directed my way, but ignored it. Then an empty water bottle was thrown my direction. I was not going to be intimidated so I continued to speak on the phone.

 Then, suddenly, two men (who were around my height and weight, 6'1"" 215) come up to me and say they'll ""take that phone off my hands.""

Again, I refuse to be intimidated. I can see a group of people from my meeting walking to the bar across the street. However, one of them quickly shove a gun into my chest.

Basically I said ""I'm out I'm out""  and walked away without a scratch - I even laughed while crossing the street. Because I got away so easily I feel as if they were bluffing and I could have stood my ground longer. As a stoic, I don't want to be rattled or intimidated easily. However, would it have been worth it? What if they weren't?

As stoics, at gunpoint, I have this instinct to be like Tommy Shelby. But that's not realistic. It's about making smart choices.

I honestly cannot figure out why, and have been meditating on it to no avail. I barely remember details of the cheating and cannot think of my motivation.

How do I stay calm when I'm being insulted and disrespected and should I be calm in such situations?,"Yesterday I was talking to this store clerk in front of my college and we were debating about something and this guy came in(2nd year, junior), involved himself in our conversation and when I countered his points and he had nothing to say so he started using foul language and said some pretty bad stuff to me. The store clerk calmed him down and sent him off. Now I didn't do anything to him. Generally I would have done something to him since I have a past of not being so calm and composed in such situations. 

So after I left from there I keep thinking about why I didn't do anything and what should I do, and I can't think of anything instead of just hurting him. I feel disrespected and angry at myself for not reacting at that moment. This was the first time anyone has been so disrespectful to me and I didn't do anything. I wonder what should I do in such situations? Should I be calm as I was but then I can't take this off my mind I keep thinking about it all day, or should I just hurt him so I feel satisfied and get my respect back. From what I know stoicism is about not being emotional and composed at all times. So please tell me what is the best thing to do in such situations? Would hurting him be a non stoic thing to do?",Stoicism,1695910319.0,t3_16uh4j3,0.63,7

Is the heroic masculine purpose equivalent to the pursuit of Stoic moral virtue?,"I just watched this video below and I cannot not see that there is a connection between the heroic masculine purpose themed in this deconstruction and the desire to live by Stoic virtues. Is there a connection? Are they the same thing? Is the heroic masculine purpose a real thing, and if so is there a place for it in Stoicism?

Part of the draw of Stoicism for me is, the desire to live a virtuous life. It oozes purpose. And to see that it permeates the idea of the masculine hero  in our popular culture shows that stoicism is mainstream yet undefined as such or masquerading as a hero's journey.

Obsessed with other people’s opinion of me,"30-M. I feel that all my life I have had an unnatural unhealthy obsession of what I speculate other people’s opinion is of me. I constantly look out for validation from other people. I attention seek a lot, espeacilly on social media which I used a lot, constantly checking who’s reacting to my posts, and also if anybody’s unfollowed me (this really gets me down.) These last 6 months though the obsession has become extensive to the point is making me mega depressed. Worth pointing out I’m 5 years teetotal, and a lot of the feelings that made me want to drink historically have started to manifest themselves again. The think is I KNOW this behaviour is unhealthy and it’s the complete antithesis of what stoicism is, caring what people think of me. The thing is I can’t seem to shake the obsession it’s become so ingrained in me. I need help man.

18M Finding friends/partners that match your energy is hard.,"
This is kinda gonna be a rant

I’m a first year just started classes and never really had a legit gf yet but i think im still pretty attractive kinda athletic but not a super big extrovert really or that into social media. Which sucks for me because usually the first people you find on social media and that stand out the most on campus are obviously going to be pretty extroverted. More into dating / hooking up, tend to be from a wealthier background ( i go to a private school so this isn’t that uncommon ), and people that go out a lot more than i do. I like being friends with extroverts ofc but i can’t really see myself being in a relationship with one i want someone more lowkey hell i’d say i would prefer to date a girl that likes to take things slowly i really need time to build trust. I feel like a lot of these extroverted people are more mature in a way which I’m probably wrong about but i don’t care which isn’t a relationship dynamic i like. I just want to know how you find quiet but also not straight up weird girls because i know their out their. And before anyone comments it my studies will always come first and i make focusing on that shit a big priority. Also another reason I’m not that extroverted i like to spend time on work.

My partner of 2 years is in recovery and I am lost in the pain of betrayal. I am hoping meditation can help but don't know where to start.,"For background, my partner and I have been together for close to 2 years. He relapsed after 6 months of us being together, and has struggled since. He is a relatively private person, but has opened up to me overtime. I am on the path to becoming an addiction specialist, so I have made sure he knows that relapses are okay, natural, and nothing to be ashamed of. I remind him everyday that there is nothing he could tell me that would make me love him less - as long as he is honest. I know from personal experience that breaking the habit of lying out of shame and guilt is one of the most difficult habits to break. I know he most likely wont tell me the truth the first of even second time I ask, but I tell him to give himself time and think before he responds. As long as he eventually tells me the truth, he will be met with love and support, as I will only get angry if he gaslights and continues to lie. He has improved so much over time, but I know it will take much longer before he is comfortable enough to come to me without prompt. Recently I have realized he will tell me only part of the truth, but the part he tells me (after I ask) is enough to make me stop. I always know when something is happening, my gut is rarely wrong. He is currently tapering, but continues to lie about the smallest details ( I .e, buying a another weed pen behind my back, buying other medications to help taper other than the medications I  am aware of). Recently I have been struggling- to the point where most of the time I feel like Im just existing. He is the love of my life and the most extraordinary, magnificent human being I know.but I  keep wondering if he needs to lose me to see that he cannot make rational decisions when it comes to drugs, and that he cant do it alone. He is adamant that he can be logical and rational on this topic, and ultimately shuts me out, even after saying he ""takes my advice and opinions into consideration"". He is working so hard, but is still hiding things from me. It is killing me that he doesn't feel comfortable enough to trust me and be vulnerable to share things he has hidden his entire life. I just dont know what to do or how to cope on my end. I feel the constant pain of betrayal, fear, and heartbreak for him and what he is going through. I need advice on how to get through this without completely falling apart. I feel alone, invisible, and just...unbearable hurt. I  am in therapy but I feel I  need more. My partner follows stoicism/meditation and it seems to be helping him, so I want to try something new. I  have never had luck with meditation and am tired of being told to ""live for today"" or that suffering is a choice.

>Ah, the concept of the parts of a whole! How often do we forget the ways in which we are all interconnected, each playing a crucial role in the grand tapestry of existence. Just as the fingers on a hand are separate, yet together form a single entity capable of great feats, so too are we all separate individuals, yet united in our common humanity. And just as the loss of a single finger can render the hand incomplete, so too can our separation from one another lead to a diminished sense of self and a loss of our full potential. Consider the example of the mice gathering cheese in the field. At first, each mouse is focused solely on their own desires, hoarding their cheese and disregarding the needs of their fellow mice. But as they begin to work together, sharing their pieces of cheese and helping one another, they are able to accomplish much more than they ever could have on their own. This is true not only for mice and cheese, but for all of us as humans. When we come together, united in our common goals and desires, we are able to accomplish great things that would have been impossible alone. But despite this, we too often let our petty differences and divisions keep us apart. We fight and bicker over matters of race, religion, and nationalism, forgetting that we are all part of the same great whole. In much the same way, when a single part of the body becomes separated from the rest, it is unable to function as it was intended, and the entire body is diminished. So too can our separation from one another lead to a diminished sense of self and a loss of our full potential.
And thus, let us remember that to be separated from man is to be separated from self. For just as the individual parts of a machine must work together in harmony to accomplish their purpose, so too must we strive to come together as one, recognizing the ways in which we are all interconnected and the essential role that each of us plays in the larger human experience. So let us put aside our differences and embrace our common humanity, for in doing so, we will find not only a sense of unity and belonging, but a greater sense of purpose and meaning in our lives. And let us remember always that we are not separate entities, but rather, we are all essential parts of a single, glorious whole",Stoicism,1675239867.0,t3_10qocl8,0.44,0

Would you do anything with someone who ignored your texts?,"

Assume this is the scenario. You find out someone was ignoring your texts because secretly they think you’re stupid, worthless, and/or want to demonstrate superiority to you.  Psychologically that is what they would be displaying and trying to appear as if the ignoring is done intentionally and they didn’t genuinely forget or get busy etc. 

Theres lots of online dating coaches advising people to do stuff like this too in order to get the other person to “chase”. So what you have in modern times is literally, a bunch of ugly guys and girls, who, might be secretly obsessed with someone, and then intentionally do things like ignore them thinking it will create attraction.

Now if you look into it, this behavior of ignoring people, being unavailable to respond etc, is something that was adapted and modelled after high value people, kings, royalty and celebrities.  Someone whos rich or powerful or otherwise has an interesting or busy life, is likely not gonna be available to reply over texts or emails much. They’ll be so successful or rich or busy they won’t have much free time.

So, being unavailable on text, can give the impression the person is successful, busy, rich, interesting life.  But it can also give the impression of superiority, like they’re too busy for you, dont have time for you, etc. 


What these nutcases in modern times are confused about, however, is that you cant create attraction magically. You have all these nutcases with no lives, no job, who literally are sitting around on phones and computers all day, but who are intentionally ignoring or delaying responses.

So they’re not actually busy or successful or rich or famous, but essentially attempting to fake being so. There’s literally dating coaches advising people to do this to give the impression of being unavailable busy and perhaps “superior”.   Those dating coaches not being in prison is also just one more symptom of the moral failure of modern times. 

So anyway, what if you were physically attracted to someone but then they’re telling you they’re too busy for you, superior to you and etc.

Would you ever do anything with that person? Wouldn’t it be making you look bad? I mean imagine if they told you (subtly) that you’re dumb inferior and worthless, and then a week later or weeks later wanted to have sex with you.

Would you actually feel good about yourself being in a relationship or having sex with someone who basically told you you’re dumb worthless and inferior? Like they’re doing you a favor by having sex with you or dating you?

If someone on the street verbally insults you or acts snobby with you, at minimum, you’d avoid that person at all cost right?  You may even insult them back if they were particularly annoying or kept coming up to you insulting you right?

So why would anyone then get into a relationship with someone who tells them they’re worthless inferior and stupid?  I would never do anything with someone who did that. We couldn’t be friends, we couldn’t be partners. In fact the only thing i could do is use the person as a verbal punching bag. This works especially well if you’ve known the person a while and know what their insecurities or weaknesses are. But make sure you only insult their morals or behavior dont insult their race or physical appearance gender etc. you can insult their behavior and morals religious and political views.   In most cases, the person will want to leave you and tell you not to contact them. And you essentially won. They told you they feel they’re superior and you’re worthless. You told them to take a hike and get a better upbringing.

I would never refer to myself as superior to someone else unless I had better morals.  In the modern world, every other person seems to be referring to themselves as superior. 

This tactic of ignoring texts can be especially brutal and insidious because you should give people some benefit of the doubt. It takes time and deduction to truly confirm if someone was intentionally ignoring you to subtly tell you they’re superior and you’re inferior and stupid, or if they genuinely forgot somehow or are bad at texting or super busy demanding job etc. 

Because it takes time to figure out, it means they might have successfully ignored your text message maybe 5, 10, or 15 times.  So if you then confirm at the 15th time that the whole time they were ignoring you, they were telling you youre inferior and worthless and stupid, it really makes you look bad. Because you continued to maintain a relationship or friendship with someone who was essentially insulting you the whole time.   Isnt it kind of embarrassing?  You basically stayed friends or partners with someone who repeatedly week after week told you you’re worthless?

The good news, though, is the longer youve known them, the more you know about their moral and behavioral issues, insecurities, and weaknesses.  So what exactly would the rational, moral person do, upon figuring out someone insulted you 15 times?  Somone insults you once, you can walk away and end things immediately.

But someone insults you 15 times, and you only realized it at the 15th time because their insults were so insidious and subtle?  Then you have to do anything you can to mentally destroy them, and then completely break off the connection.  They insulted you, and you stayed in the relationship or friendship. So now you need to insult them, until they leave the friendship or relationship and tell you to not contact them etc.",Stoicism,1658495162.0,t3_w5a6gr,0.44,0
Should I have children?,"Considering our ever growing population, would it be virtuous to not have children and instead foster/adopt? Creating new life also gives potential for the baby to be born with illnesses, defects, causing more suffering. Whereas adopting a child who is already here would most likely reduce suffering if you provide them with a stable and caring household. Resources should also be taken into account, creating a new life adds another entire individual to the world, who will need to consume to survive. 

I would like to have my own children one day, I'm sure many people do, but isn't that just a preference determined by biology? I could still experience raising a child through adoption, this seems to be the better option considering the potential suffering caused by creating new life.

Stoics Opinions on beards. How to combat the struggle of parents wanting their child to shave his beard.,"In *How to think like a Roman Empereor* by Donald Roberston a line that stuck out for me was: ""Epictetus  had  defiantly  exclaimed that if the authorities wanted to cut off his beard, they’d have to cut off his  
head first""(pg. 102). 

I related this to my own experience with growing a beard. Because of my brown skin complexion, I often look like a Muslim with a grown out beard. Parents and elders in my life have exclaimed how dirty and similar it makes me look like a Muslim. For most of my life, being at the mercy of my parents in this capitalist society I usually shave it when it starts causing too many issues as I am indifferent truly. Of course, I love my beard.

&#x200B;

 ""*Neither should the beard be cut from the chin (for it is not superfluous), but it too has been provided for us by nature as a kind of cover or protection. Moreover, the beard is nature’s symbol of the male just as is the crest of the cock and the mane of the lion; so one ought to remove the growth of hair that becomes burdensome, but nothing of the beard; for the beard is no burden so long as the body is healthy and not afflicted with any disease for which it is necessary to cut the hair from the chin.* ""  *— Musonius Rufus, Lecture XXI*

What are you? Stoic or Sophist?,"It has come to my attention that plenty of people claim to be stoic or claim to know about Stoicism by just reading Marcus Aurelius ,Seneca or Epictetus. 
They claim that they have mastered the arts of ""Stoicism"" just by reading a few quotes on the internet or they claim they fully comprehend it. 
This my brothers is nothing but Sophism. A claim that wants to be read as truth.

My first steps into philosophy and into Stoicism was the same , I thought "" What a wonderful world"" and started doing the stoic exercises, I started reading Marcus Aurelius (my favorite philosopher btw) and started watching youtube videos about stoic practices. But just like any other placebo , it doesnt hold for too long. 

Stoicism suggests for you to live on a philosophy manner , what i dont see from people is this. They just want the placebo that comes with Stoicism,  placebos that if you dont know what youre talking about it wont work out for you.

Seneca,Cinion, Aurelius, Epicteto what they all have in common , that before calling themselves ""Stoics"" they are philosophers they have study philosophy,  metaphysics,  mathematics, philosophy of science,  cynicism. They all studied the philosophers before Stoics , Aristotle, Plato, Socrates,  presocrates , Diogenes. All the philosophy before Stoicism.  They truly knew what Ethics was all about and the problem I see with this new so called NeoStoics is that non of them seem to have critical thinking which is a virtue , they claim they know how the virtues work without knowing how ethics,  metaphysics works first . 

They want to be Stoic but dont seem to be philosophers first , and the illusion of people who thinks they're Stoic it completely breaks into pieces. Just as in neobudhism where people claimed to know about the practices of buddhism because they ""meditate"" or are more ""mindfulness"" it does not hold you have if you have not question the world we live in ,how it works , and why it works the way it do , meditation is not gonna save from the mental illness of capitalism or a bad government does to you and this is what is happening to Stoicism as well , people are using as a religion. They are relying on it ,not any different then what a Christian would do .

My point is , you want to call yourself a stoic ok , just be aware that before the real Stoics called themselves like that they study philosophy, mathematics, science, astrophysics and plenty of more fields , and went through years and years studying before they were able to fully comprehend the world around them. 
This is what Neo Stoics don't do and it is fundamental if one wants to be called stoic . Read what philosophy came after Stoicism,  read about psychology, about astronomy, about science,  develop critical thinking, develop your virtues but before developing virtues read the classic so that you know what they meant by virtues.

Don't cage yourself only on Stoicism by  predicting as if you were a philosopher , repeating quotes of Stoics , this is what differentiate philosophy from shopism.",Stoicism,1625514767.0,t3_oeexit,0.44,0

"Wait, is Stoicism just Christianity minus the mythology and dogma?","Christian ethics seem pretty similar to Stoic ethics. I think what happened is that the entire Greece-Roman world (at least for the educated types) in the medeterainian adopted a similar ethical system and this became absorbed into Christianity while stoicism became forgotten. A lot of early Christians were Neo-Platonists and Stoics and the transition from those views to Christianity would have not been that large. A lot of people look at Rome and see this huge gulf between the polytheism and Christianity and can't see how the change happened, but if you start to look at the philosophies you see them as a bridge.

So that means Stoicism might be a kind of Christianity-lite but minus the rituals, mythology and specific dogma. Christian ethics without the Christianity.

The connection between Greco-Roman mythology and Christianity is well documented but I've not seen anyone talk of the philosophical similarities which seem obvious to me.

Edit: This books seems to argue just what I'm observing.

Is there any true stoic whose writings survived other than Epictetus?

Calling in sick?,"I wonder how the practicing stoics among you handle the following situation: You need to go to work but you also need to go. You will miss the bus and only get there by noon. You have important meetings.

Diogenes defecated in public. I don't believe he did it to offend people. Duties and the will to perform a duty are under one's control, while this painful urge and the relief from it are not. Hence it follows that one should very much defecate in public if locating a bathroom means neglecting a duty.

However, one could argue that the duty to not offend people is perhaps more important than the duty of keeping your work hours.

Have you ever thought of this? What do you do? Do you give way to the external impression of needing to have a bowel movement?

How does Stoicism reconcile the fact that Marcus Aurelius was known to regularly use Opium?,"*edit*

People seem to be very quick to play the ""We're all human"" card.

Fair enough.

The reason I asked this question is because from personal experience I can say that using mind-altering substances has an indisputable impact not only on one's cognitive ability, but on their ability to process and act upon logical parameters, such as Stoicism. 

ie. its very easy to be accepting, calm and rational, when you are aided by drugs. It is easier to overcome many of the drives, urges, inhibitions and other limitations as a result. 

As such I wonder if it perhaps changes things, with regards to Aurelius and Stoicism. 

No I don't judge him, or anyone, for using substances, especially if they promote wellness, mental or physical. However it is naive to think that they did not have an influence, either on his perspective (and by proxy, teachings) or on his ability to live what he preached.

This Is *Literally* A Self Help Forum At This Point.,"After joining her months ago, I soon realized this was not really a place to discuss stoicism, but more so a place for people to ventabout their issues, and ask the question ""How would a stoic deal with situation X?"" with various different situations. Why is this the go to thought process when people think of stoicism, that it is a self help strategy? I went ahead and counted all the posts that were simply asking for help on things sorting by new right now. After 48/50 of the most recent posts where nothing more than asking help on how to deal with situations, I knew for sure that I was seeing the situation correctly, and I wasn't just noticing the bad posts standing out from the good. Do you guys like it to be a self help forum? Would you rather have it be this way than actually furthering your understanding of stoicism? I absolutely love stoicism &amp;amp; philosophy as a whole, But this sub has become.. insufferable. R/philosophy only has posts about furthering your philosohical knowledge. R/askphilosophy doesn't have 1000 questions asking how to deal with some of the most trival ""problems"" on the planet. Why here? To those of you who have actually dug into stoic readings, and provide geniune insight, you're wonderful. But to those of you who come here to ask questions like ""My girlfriend broke up with me &amp;amp; is making our friends choose between us, how can I ever manage? This is seems like the end of the road for me."" because you've seen a Marcus Aurelius quote on instagram...  know you're bringing shame upon the whole forum. Until later r/stoicism. Hope it can improve to a more useful philsophical subreddit sometime soon.



Edit: I can't respond to all of you right now, But I will over the next few days. To those of you who are in disagreement with my overall point though, consider the fact that this one post has gotten more engagement, interaction, and overall discourse than the last 50 posts combined.

How do I best deal with this and be stoic?,"Please explain how best to handle this situation in the best way possible. I want to practice stoicism but don’t know whereto start

I befriended a guy and I became really close to him emotionally. I was new in his country and he started to feel like family. He turned out to be an asshole though and I had to stop being friends with him. What followed was one of the most difficult time of my life and just when I was starting to feel better he came back. My mistake because I had him blocked and then he somehow got a hold of me in person. He made it seem like a coincidence but it wasn’t. After that I unblocked him thinking i am over him. Now he texts me every other day and I find myself waiting for his text again. I hate it. I don’t want to make a show of blocking him again but i want to keep calm and just somehow detach.

"Not sure what the point of this post is, maybe just to get things off my mind."," 

Im a 20-year-old guy who recently wrapped up my gap year with a lot of hard work. Despite earning good money, I didn't save any. I spent it on a car and started but never finished my driving license. Now, the car sits unused, and another insurance payment is coming up.

Most of my earnings went into partying and, unfortunately, drugs. Thankfully, I've kicked that habit and don't feel the urge anymore—except when I drink, which is rare now. I've started university but missed three months of classes. I want to contact university about my situation but im scared they will kick me out for not doing any work at all. I like my course and the topics, but I can't bring myself to engage. I label myself as lazy, but when I attempt something, I can't seem to enjoy it.

While I hesitate to say I'm depressed, I feel lost. I enjoy life, people, even the ""bad"" ones, but I struggle to like myself or work on self-improvement. I have a wonderful girlfriend, and I know I'm smart, but when things start improving, I feel out of place, and they take a downturn again.

Two years ago, I lost my dad to alcohol, went through a breakup, and lost a friend, all in one year. Looking back, that seems to be when things started spiraling, and im not looking for an excuse, i cannot control that. 

I often compare myself to my successful sister, measuring my worth by materialistic standards, despite knowing it's not a healthy approach.

Today, my MacBook screen broke, adding to my stress as repairs will strain my already dead budget, but life continues with or with out. I'm not sure if this post even makes sense, but I felt the need to write and seek constructive criticism or just an understanding ear. It's strange—I know what I need to do, but I'm just not doing it. I'm trying, but it's all so confusing. This may sound like a cry for help, and I'm aware of that. I appreciate stoicism and the people here, and I just wanted to unload my thoughts.

If most of this doesnt make sense, dont worry, it doesnt in my head also.

Being partner to someone with a chronic health issue,"Hello. My wife has Type 2 Diabetes and I find it so hard sometimes to keep myself steady. Stoicism teaches us how to bear most things and when it comes to health, its bearing your own health, better or worse. I find it much harder to deal with the sickness of my wife though. She suffers from anxiety and depression along with a couple year old Type 2 Diabetes diagnoses. I am so worried that she is not strong enough to do what is right for herself and that relatively soon our situation in life will be quite dire. At this point she can still work, but has so many days of just not feeling good, physical or mental.

I know so much of what she has to do is out of my control totally and all I can really do is cheer from the sidelines. What happens to her affects me in SO many ways. My emotions and feelings are one thing, but just the quality of life her health lowers upon both our shoulders is immense. The future will likely only be worse. As a Stoic it is my duty to look at life and imagine the things that will happen to be better prepared. That is very hard when I consider the goals and things we wanted to do in life. 

So I know it isn't cancer and I know its something that should be managed better and I also know I can't make her and I know as a couple we will be sad the whole time dealing with it. I am at the mercy of someone I love. And trying to be ok with the lack of control I have is painful. Anyone else out there following Stoicism as a life handbook living a similar reality?

"""A lie told to protect oneself is the truth""_publilius Syrus","""If a character chooses to tell the truth in a situation where telling a lie would gain him nothing, the choice is trivial, the moment expresses nothing. But if the same character insists on telling the truth when a lie would save his life,then we sense that honesty is at the core of his nature""_Robert McKee,Story

In an episode of Boston Legal I saw many years ago, Alan Shore (James Spader) is in the early days of a relationship with a female Judge who tells him that it’s ok if he’s attracted to other women. As long as he channels that attraction to her instead of to them. Taking her at her word, he starts physically flirting with her as he admits he was attracted to another woman. Angry, she pulls away and tells him not to touch her and doesn’t want to speak to him. He goes to sleep wondering what just happened.


Confused, Alan talks about it the next day with Denny Crane (William Shatner), who tells him, “The key to any good relationship is lying. You tell her she’s the only one you find attractive, the only girl you wanna sleep with, the only one you really wanna spend time with. All kinds of garbage they can’t possibly believe. Women count on us to lie to them. How else can they convince themselves that they still look young if we don’t help?”

So the next time Alan sees her, he asks:
Alan Shore: Just so I’m clear… if I’m ever even slightly attracted to another woman, I should just lie about that?
Judge Gloria Weldon: Through your teeth.
Alan Shore: Hm. Really? Why would you tolerate dishonesty from your partner?
Judge Gloria Weldon: I wouldn’t. If I ever catch you lying to me, it’s over.
Alan Shore: But you just…
Judge Gloria Weldon: No. It’s very simple, Alan. When you tell me that you’re not attracted to anybody else but me, it needs to be the truth.
Alan taps his fingers as he lets this sink in.

I feel like judge gloria in that last bit was echoing Epictetus(Discourses 3.7): ""..no woman ought to seem beautiful to you except your own wife....""

And while what Epictetus teaches here is practical and doable, I don't think fidelity and honesty are considered as valuable in the society I live in.To me, drama and being cheated on are far more valuable to the women in my society. Perhaps it's the same thing Seneca meant in on benefits by ""Men Nowadays nolonger secretly, but openly outrage the wives of others...no one takes a wife unless he takes her away from someone else..Soon adultery becomes the most respectable form of marriage..."". William Law while making an argument for the dignity and intelligence of women while overlooking whatever flaws they may posses wrote ""they are often too ready to receive the first fops, beaux, and fine dancers for their husbands, it is no wonder they should like that in men which they have been taught to admire in themselves.""",Stoicism,1697054702.0,t3_175ngfc,0.5,0

Advice on emotional controll,"So basically i picked up day trading about 2 years ago, and have been mercilessly studying it and i have finally gotten the hang of it, and statistically it works, but this is where the problem arises.

When i finally think that there is nothing that i have missed i find myself loosing a trade purely because i failed to recognize something, and i get increadible furious. And this anger carries over to the next day when i am supposed to trade again and because of that anger i do something irrational that i know i should not do, which in turn leads to me losing again which then reignites the anger and frustration, and the most frustrating thing is looking back on the trade and seeing the exact place where i failed without even knowing why i did it, as it makes no sense.

I have been reading and applying stoicism for about 6 month in every aspect of life and have been especially fond of ""be indifferent to what makes no difference""  and i have been trying to accept all kinds of situations as they come and treat them as an opportunity to learn, but when it comes to trading i lose my sh\*t.

How to stop overthinking and start living in the present?,"22M who just graduated from college.

I am going through the phase of overthinking right now which makes me feel depressed. I have trouble sleeping at night, wherein when I wake up to take a sip of water or use the restroom, I have trouble sleeping back since my thoughts keep wandering and focus on the negative elements of life or comparing my life with others in a few cases.

Even when I go outside to roam/travel my negative thoughts don't seem to take a break and affect time living in the moment. I am where I wanted to be when I was younger which is a major thing I thank myself for for not giving up and working hard. One of the factors I feel is that I  distanced myself from my college friend with whom I made many memories and hoped we would be lifelong friends, but I couldn't since he moved to a new friend group where I didn't feel valued and honestly, it wasn't the ideal friend group I wanted so I left. The distancing part was probably the most tragic experience I have had till now since I would have a few dreams now and then where he was enjoying himself with his new friends(and mocking me a few times), and I was a lonely guy who was in the final year of college without any friends. I have moved on, but I  guess my mental state hasn't. It has been around a year since this happened and tbh I haven't really enjoyed living/been truly happy since then. Since then, I tried mingling with a couple of new friend groups but am probably being used there so I distanced myself from them again too.

The above-mentioned experiences have made me mature and better at people reading but also resulted in me overthinking.  
I  am very concerned about this and don't want this to affect my mental health in the future. We all know this age is the prime where our mind settles and I don't want my overthinking at this stage to affect and put me in a bad mental state affecting my life and dependents in the long run.

Any tips/bits of advice are welcome. TIA :)

Reconciling Stoic virtues while remaining safe,"During the early hours of a summer morning I was taking a tram back home when I noticed what looked to be like a timid girl in her late teens take a seat two rows ahead of me. After a couple of stops a guy dressed in a typical roadman outfit that was around the same age as her came in through the entrance door behind me, scanned the tram  from front to back and rapidly approached the young woman. 

As soon as he was facing her he slapped her really hard and grabbed her by the throat and shook her from side to side repeatedly while yelling extremely loudly in a Middle Eastern language. 

I was reading a book right before this happened and once it started I was in complete shock. Since I knew there was no one else around (there was only an old lady in the tram who appeared to have just come back from a long camping trip with a big backpack), I knew it was my responsibility to protect the poor girl. I put my book in my bag and got up to try to deescalate the situation but I noticed there was a large bulge on the side of his pants that looked awfully similar to the case of a machete (it is EXTREMELY common for these kind of roadmen to have knives on them). I suppose I only took notice of this then since I had gotten up and was about to act, so my brain did a thorough check on the guy before I did so. Whether this was actually there or was simply a byproduct of fear / adrenaline, coupled with the fact I could not focus over the loud screaming on his part, I don't know. 

All I knew is that I had to help this girl, all that happened is that I cowardly left the tram and left her behind like a vermin. I called the police and explained the situation and I also called the public transport company to report the incident. However the realistic side of me knows this did no difference. 

The values that I hold, and the values held by stoicism, detail I should act justly, with courage and honor. But my actions that morning were the complete opposite. 

A part of me wishes I would have tried to deescalate anyways, to let my head lead instead of my heart. This implies that I should risk the possibility of death if that is what it takes to act in accordance to my beliefs. 

The other part, however, tells me I should “Be real”. And that I should not risk dying for this. 

I honestly regret what I did, although a year has passed I still think about it and I often think: “If I was given a chance to redeem myself in the near future with similar circumstances, would I take the risk this time?” 

I feel like an absolute coward, a hypocrite who does not stand for what he believes in. I have trained bjj and muay thai for years but the variable of a knife having been added to the equation was too much for me at the time.

How to Increase Pain Tolerance Level? (Physical and Mental),"I'll begin with this quote

>Life is a tragedy to those who feel and a comedy to those who think - Jean Racine.

2 years ago, I was sitting at rock bottom. I was 14 and I always only felt things emotionally and never took anything to thought consideration. It was only after I found stoicism where it felt like I actually felt that I was living a life. I only existed all the time (never had an average middle class life) but it was only in the last year where I felt like I found some holy truth.

Like I said, I've always saw things up close. I only felt and reacted. I never thought about it. Feelings only worsen the pain that I had with my problems. 

So I embarked on a journey to reduce the emotions I felt with my problems and to find a way to take it in stoically.

Here's what I've learned:

\- There's no mental suffering. You can never suffer from any kind of mental disease (except if it has to do with your physical brain). ""You have power over your mind, not outside events. Realize this and you'll find strength"". In order to increase your mental pain tolerance level, you just need to see it objectively. If that's not enough, change the way you see it. There's no way to decrease your mental pain suffering than to realize that it's just your perception and your own coloring on it. Just face the hard truth and realize you are immune to it. Assume you have the ability to take in any harsh truth and just take it in bluntly. Trust me, if you know and realize you've the ability to intake the truth, you've already solved the problem. ""The Giant outside you is never bigger than the god inside you"".

\- Physical pain tolerance is necessary. You've to train yourself to your maximum extent. You have to feel the physical pain flow through your entire body. It enables your mind to have a choice: feel it like a layman or use it as an opportunity. Everyone feels pain, but it's how about how you feel it that dictates your growth in the future. This has correlation with the strength of your mind. Every time you're about to feel a pain is an opportunity or a level in a game, To prove to yourself if you do indeed have what it takes (god has already given you), You just need to acknowledge the strength. 

\- Going to gym isn't enough. I see people go to gym and says they have fun in having pain. No, You're having dopamine, you're not having pain. Yes, You might be growing your muscle but there's no point in calling it a pain if there's comfort involved in doing it. See our body can enjoy physical pain, it can even spark dopamine. Do the things you never feel like doing it. The exact time your brains says you can't do something or you don't feel like it, that's exactly when you have to fucking do it.

\- It's only constant intake and contact with pain that can make you feel as a stoic. Do everyday something that makes you feel uncomfortable. Put a calendar on your wall and tick off everyday you feel discomfort. Change is possible, only if you will it to be.

I've thought about it and I know I'm not trans, but I am more masculine, at least in the way I dress. I also came to realize that I'm very likely gay. 

The problem is that this is somewhat new, and both me and my therapist are confident it stems from trauma, at least in part. It wasn't of a sexual nature, but somehow it seemed to really mess with my identity. Either that or I'm simply growing up and have had the opportunity to find my personality after being intensely sheltered as a kid.

I began to value strength and capability above all else. I began to care about being a good and honorable person. I started taking martial arts classes and going to the gym, hobbies I've kept up and have been very consistent with for three years. Yet, I also began to hate being a woman. I hated being weaker, I hated being seen a certain way and sexualized (especially because I'm pretty much devoid of sexual desire), I hated having biology that I knew I wouldn't use, biology that limited me physically. I was often the only woman in my martial arts gym, and the guys would go easy on me and turn around and wail on each other. I wanted that ferocity. Martial arts and the gym (among other smaller hobbies) had pretty much become my identity and I had met amazing people through them, yet they began to contribute to this disdain of my womanhood. 

I came to accept most of these things over time, knowing that there wasn't much I could do about them. I didn't want to be a man, so there was no use in hormones. I resolved to do what I could, getting as strong as I could personally be and becoming as skilled as I personally could. I resigned to play the cards I was dealt, operating within my own capabilities instead of wishing I had someone else's. 

Still, this sort of split in my identity lingered. Femininity was something I abandoned when I started dressing myself and buying my own clothes. I spent most of my time in the gym building my upper body. I shoved these feelings to the side until they came back to bite me even harder. I didn't like having the body I had. I hated having breasts. I began to fall into depression until I realized that whatever I was doing wasn't helping me in the long run. I was distracting myself, chasing this ever moving goalpost hoping that one day I'd just be happy with myself. I took my first ever voluntary hiatus from martial arts after attending nearly every day for three years with the plan to work through whatever I was running from. 

That was nearly three weeks ago, I think. I opened up to my therapist about my struggles, as I had kept most of them to myself the entire time we had been meeting. I told them about the extreme discomfort around my chest and that I was considering top surgery. They were encouraging, agreeing that I had a very long time to make my decision as I have to save up the money to pay out of pocket. 

For the first time in a while, I felt true hope. I felt that if I could get surgery, I would be much more free. I never liked my breasts and have spent a very long time covering them up nearly 24/7. I thought about how nice it would feel physically not to have them, to simply take my shirt off at night to sleep or go out in the rain and feel the air and raindrops on my shoulders and back. I thought about getting out of the shower and wrapping a towel around my waist, not having to put something over my chest almost instantly. The freedom I'd feel not having to cover them up, but to simply throw a shirt on and go about my day. People wouldn't be as awkward about trying not to hit my breasts in training. If I ended up in a relationship, I wouldn't have to worry about covering them and asking my partner to ignore them. I could wear tighter shirts. I could feel the world more closely without having two annoying blobs on my chest moving around. If I could just rid myself of breasts, I would be alright with who I am. I could simply live as a woman without breasts. I could be who I am, not worrying about politics or special labels. 

Yet, I feel like a freak. To many, this is self-mutilation. It is arguably not stoic, as I should be content with the body I have, or at least accept it and be grateful that I have a relatively healthy body. Sometimes I feel like it would be the thing that frees me, other times I feel insane, like even considering such a thing makes me mentally ill and unworthy of respect and love. It would isolate me even more, especially where I live. 

I haven't slept well in these weeks. My mind has been racing with possibilities and thoughts and emotions. I would be hard pressed to find a therapist who isn't pressured to agree with me, or I'd find someone on the complete opposite end of the spectrum. My family doesn't know about this or my being gay. I feel like I'm wearing a mask, hiding the face of something ugly and strange. 

I don't know what to do. ",Stoicism,1687484961.0,t3_14glkjr,0.5,0

Seeking Stoic Advice: Balancing desire for other women and commitment to a good partner,"Hello Stoic community,

I find myself in a predicament and would greatly appreciate your wisdom and insights. As a follower of Stoic philosophy, I am torn between two conflicting desires: the inclination to explore relationships with other women and the desire to remain in a relationship to my current partner, who is an amazing person and has no fault for me feeling this way.

Drawing inspiration from the wisdom of ancient philosophers, I'm curious to hear your thoughts on what advice they might offer in navigating this situation. How can I apply Stoic principles to find clarity and make the most virtuous decision in this predicament?

Thank you in advance for your guidance. I look forward to learning from your perspectives and insights.

Additional note: Please be aware that I am a good partner as well and I have not acted on the desires, I understand that these are just desires but I am looking for clarity on this specific type of example.",Stoicism,1686393620.0,t3_145wygw,0.5,0

"""I wouldn't even expect my girlfriend not to cheat on me""","This is from a francophone rapper from Belgium, he is called Damso and is a great rapper and it's easy to see he loves music. 

I heard this sentence in an interview of him on YouTube and I found it to be in accordance with Stoicism. 

I think this is a great reminder to not expect people to act like you want them to act but just accept and recognise they are external to you and that you can't control the actions of other people. It doesn't mean you can't trust people, you even have to find friends you can fully trust for example but it still doesn't mean they are in your control, they aren't and they are still human beings and human beings can make mistakes. So don't be upset or surprised if someone betrays you, just accept, it's okay to feel sad but don't get overwhelmed by what you feel and always respond to people's actions in a virtuous way. This is not a lesson as I still struggle myself with this sometimes, this is just a reminder and also a small text to tell you to keep working and improving yourself everyday. Use the time you have in the best way possible. Peace on y'all.",Stoicism,1682632364.0,t3_1318iat,0.5,0
Stoic gratitude for endurance and self control,"The last couple of months I have been more vigorously than before applying my stoic and other philosophical principles to my everyday life. It amazes me constantly how effortless it really is when one truly believes in it and instead has it as a constant motivation instead of falling victim to irrational urges!

Yesterday I attended a quite intense cross-fit (that’s the best word for it) class at my collage (also the best word for the international basis, i’m a “teacher assistant” at something called a folk high school). 

I started out thinking I might take it easy as I was already quite sore from only one rest day and otherwise intense exercise the previous week. But, as I started out, the excitement, enthusiasm and vigour for perseverance and endurance came to me. I realise now that it was a bit excessive, harmful and certainly NOT stoic perfection, then, but I wanted to try and see if I really could use my mind to overcome something a bit extreme, as stoicism says one can. I also must admit that I sort of got carried away thinking about what it would be like had I been a soldier of Rome of maximum virtue. The imagination is truly wonderful :)

So, throughout I never ceased my intensity at every station (we did intervals w rotations to different stations). And pushed myself beyond what I have ever known before. My muscles were sending profound signals of pain to my brain, and it was very painful at moments, but I never gave in. My willpower and self control triumphed simply because I believed it would.

I’ve had similar experiences before, and definitely lately as I’ve been more conscious of it, but not on this level before. So I am immensely thankful to the stoics who came before who I have learnt so much from!

Has anybody else had similar experiences they’d like to share? I’d love to hear them, let’s all inspire each other! <3",Stoicism,1681812205.0,t3_12qi4v1,0.5,0

Separation between work and worker: Useful for the Ryan Holiday debate,"I know we see the 'Ryan Holiday debate' pretty often here, so I thought I'd start a new thread engaging with an important distinction I don't often see engaged with, separating the work and the feelings we have about the worker.

You may find Holiday's brand off-putting, and it's sales-focused nature to be against the ideals of stoicisim. That the lessons might misinterpret the core concepts of stoicism, even if only by omission.

Try to engage with the actual, direct statements made by Holiday or the Daily Stoic brand. Ask good questions. Unpack what implications or assumptions are in those statements. That discourse only helps you and other stoics explore and practice these concepts.

**Don't get upset on behalf of Stoicism!** Whether or not Holiday / Daily Stoic *should* be prominent in stoicism isn't worth debating. It's already happened.

And if you came in through the Daily Stoic (as many do), and if you still find value in the books and emails and podcasts produced by that brand, that is also okay.

Someone critiquing the brand today aren't demanding to retroactively remove the positive experiences you've had. So if a critique is happening, it's not worth pointing out that the Daily Stoic was your entry point, that you have gratitude for that, as a way to suggest that the critique isn't valid. Your positive memory isn't being attacked, a fellow philosopher is being debated.

**Don't get upset on behalf of Holiday / Daily Stoic!** He and they are more than capable of defending their own work, if they choose to.

I would love for a reminder like this to be posted every time Holiday comes up, or a sticky in the subreddit, just so we can point to it and then get on to debating the actual statements and ideas that prompted any particular post.",Stoicism,1677091745.0,t3_1197pp0,0.5,0

Survival/Hardcore Minecraft forces me to use Stoicism,"Yeah, it sounds very silly but currently I'm not passing through much pain or crysis in real life, I'm mostly calm and relaxed when I'm at job and I'd consider that I'm happy doing my thing. But when I get to play Minecraft Survival or Hardcore, I'm surprised myself when I discover that I'm very annoyed and I do mumble, to the point of even hitting my own leg, when I die and lose all of my things suddenly.

Usually I tend to rationalize everything in the sense that all of my stuff can be lost or will be lost, that even if I progress a lot, tomorrow I will lose my most precious stuff such as enchanted armor and, that's not a bad thing because that's how the game is meant to be, and it's just a game. It happened that even if I had a lot of progress building a house and having the mediums to regenerate what I've lost, I got frustrated to the point of deleting the world and starting again.

Now because of Stoicism I'm less affected by that, but still I need to fight that emotional habit that triggers by itself the exact moment I lost something. If that's so in a game, how would it be in real life?

But... there is another truth here, right? You CAN change your reactions. You can work on yourself.

Oddly enough, in the mainstream narrative of our culture, it seems that this is largely unknown. People seem to perceive their own reactions as something that ""just happens"". They cannot help but get angry. Romantic love is only valid when it hits you almost against your will, and so on.

2. Stay in the sub and keep posting because you shouldn't let them change you

The idea of ignoring them is implied for me because I really don't care they didn't like the joke. I just don't know if leaving is best because they're not worth my time, but some say if someone does something you don't like and you distant yourself, you're allowing them to change you so they win. In the same sense you could argue contemplating this is allowing them to change me so that could mean I care and have already been changed by it.

What is an effective way to regulate your emotions especially if people take advantage of them to the point where you can no longer feel them since they concider you weak but not expressing any emotions ever kills you and makes you overwhelmed severely angry since you're not allowed to express them?," 

I was always bullied in school and always had problems with anger and crying,it is extremely easy to make me cry, I tried to hide it and hold it in but to no avail, and the insults only got more harsh and harsh so they can laugh at my suffering. The bullying got to the point where I was struck down each time I tried to smile or laugh or tried to not be disconnected and isolated from my peers and tried to play uno or PE with them, only to be commented on and hit with a basketball ball in the face nad then laughed at. I wasn't even concidered human and basically every other girl despite being horrible and manipulative was treated with respect while because they saw me as weird I was dehuminized and treated as less than because I didnt fit the standart of the mean feminine girl, I liked to study while they all cheated and basically they just hated me and took advantage of anything I did since I was afraid of speaking up. This made me feel helpless and suislidal and I developed real muteness, I try to cope by going back into situations and imagining what I want to say to them but honestly they wouldnt have listneed to me anyway, so I get retriggered.

My therapist tries to tell me to ""break up with them"" since they live in my mind rent free and haunt me while they themselves were never punished and never spend a second even thinking about me and I am supposed to either magically move on or forgive but I don't want this to haunt me. I became cold and distant and isolated my self as a result however I do need people, not talking to anyone for a long time made me puke out of anxiety the same way my bullies made me puke just by being near me and hearing their voice. I felt both invisible and hated which is the worst situatuon to be on since no one cares about you much to stand up for you but you somehow stand out enough to be bullied and not accepted anywhere and no one wanted to sit next to you or be near you. I really struggle to be nice and love life and relate to people since I rarely had friends and i DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT WEIRD MEANS, PEOPLE JUST NEVER TELL ME YET IT IS OKAY TO TREAT ME WITH DISRESPECT AND LIKE I AM SUBHUMAN, and I am magically supposed to be confident and cool and make a comeback. What if I dont want to stand up for my self.

What if I can't. What if I never could. Abusing me all the time into submisivness and muteness wouldn't make me learn, telling me to go to martial arts and spending money learning some moves that won't work on the street won't help me move on. I really struggle to not only feel my emotions but express them, since I am an emotional perso nand connect with people through emotions and without them I feel hollow, while these mentally ill people bullied me and terroized me and laughed at my misery just because they have problems probably and don't know how to handle them besides being cruel to someone they dislike which isn't even a valid reason to harass a person, a lot of people don't like me but never bully me, same with me. I am tired of being nice and depending on people's niceness and smiling and being the good girl if al lI get is disrespect, but being mean isn' the solution either, this whole assertiveness thing looks like just being a cold b, and I have no logical idea why people respect that more, it is like I am never allowed to be my self, to be honest, to just express any emotion without being attacked by some jerk or laughed at.

No wonder I became paranoid, insecure and anxoious and was bullied into not giving a damn. I care too much and pushing me to the point where I don't care speaks volumes about how much of a psychopath someone is. I feel like I was really bright, like a light on a candle and they really wanted to break me and succeeded. I mean, who wouldn't have broke when a group of people constantly comment on what they do - WHat is she DOING, WHAT IS SHE DOING, WHAT IS SHE DOING. Why is it so important to you, a person who has social life and friends, what is a person without those things doing. It is like some mystery and they must know what I must do so they can laugh at it, even my breathing and walking. But no. I am maniacal and insane clearly. They wil never care, remember or take responsiblity and will never apologize but honestly I just want an explanation beyond - you're an easy target, stop being an easy target and you won't be bullied, cause like this whole punch the bully is not that much working, especially if you are a girl, and especially if your bullies are hostile boys that threaten to beat you up simply for you DARING to stand up for your self verbally after years of all kinds of abuse. This is why I hate sex. the bullying feels like a methaphor for rape, more like anal rape where my hands are tied and i just take it. And I dont want to have sex with a guy for this reason, it makes me cry to think abou it.

A person who spent her entire life making others happy and ended up miserable didn't deserve to bullied but bullies always somehow rationalize it, even though there is no reason behind their deeds and you are always blamed that you wanted it and should have defneded your self better but when you do, you are either slapped, beaten up, stalked or just told to suck it up and ignore it. Being emotional is part of being a woman, being a human and I get tirggered very easily and a lot of things overwhelm me. Simple hug makes me cry, and I lash out in anger for simple things. I am clearly traumatized but am afraid that my trauma will haunt me for the rest of my life no matter how much I go to a psychologist, for whatever reason people perceive me as weak and attack me unless I act like a emotionless psychopath, but not expressing any emotions hurts me, it makes me feel like drowning. Does anyone of you have any advice about emotional regulation or how to express emotions in a healthy way without being destructive or looking like a crazy 5 year old, because I do act like that because I cant verbalize neither emotions nor what happened to me even though I am out of high school. I just cant move on while everyone else moved on. I hate being watched. i HATE being judged. I hate being disliked or hated.

This is why I was a people pleaser, to avoid abuse. I just want peace nad love. And I don't understand why I must fight constantly for basic respect. Why is it so hard for me to make friends? Why does the male gener dislike me so much? Is it because I am not dumb and hot? So ugly girls deserve to be abused is that it? I really wish I could have spoken up more but I was so suislidal that i just dissociated a lot and was in my own fantasy world in class, too tired to say or do anything or even defend my self. I am still afraid to talk to guys but I do want to date. I just hate how people pick up on stupid things and go - aha, you are weak, we will gang up on you and bully you. I am tired of being vulnerable for simply existing and having human emotions here and there. I really need advice on how to handle this, how to be more here in the now, how to heal, meditation and exercise don't work if you are too overwhelmed. No matter what I do I can't seem to move on and seem mentally stuck in high school, living in purgatory of my own memories which haunt me and make me relive this hell every day, I can't seem to process it no matter how much I think about it, and I am supposed to magically have confidence nad love my self and trust my self and set boundaries when I was mistreated most of my life. People have more severe traumas, like losing parents going to war, and even though my father passed away recently, and I have other traumas, my brain can't process my bullying trauma and it affects me more severely than any other trauma I have.

Mediations by Marcus Aurelius,"I have just started reading Meditations and I am new to stoicism so please correct me if I'm interpreting anything wrong here.

Disadvantages in being stoic?,"After studying and practicing stoicism for a while I’ve hit a wall in the logic.
Being stoic can be disadvantageous in many situations. 

When pursuing something, being passionate about it will push you farther. Being stoic destroys that passion, because it should be an indifference. For example pursuing higher education loses its meaning, thus crushing the emotional pursuit if it’s put in the preferred indifferences category.

When talking with people, being invested emotionally helps in communication. If we act solely stoically, none of the events they are talking about will mean anything to us. So either we fake being emotionally receptive (good luck on that), or tell them outright it doesn’t matter. Being completely honest destroys potential relations, makes it harder to create a proper network with whom interacting it. Honesty goes in opposition with preferred indifferences.

When adversities come, being emotional brings attention to the obstacles you’re trying to solve. If your car is on fire, and you’re trying to put it out (it is preferable to have a car than not), screaming in honest panic, being agitated will attract people’s attention and you will get help much faster.

When talking with employers, services, acting with emotion will make them pay attention better.
The art to fake being emotional for a preferred indifference is dishonest and not virtuous. Being emotional is useful.

How can you achieve goal without the use of emotions?
Anger can be transferred into useful energy when making tasks.
Sadness can help you empathize.

If you’re in a battlefield, being fearful might save your life. Being scared of the sword makes your head faint the blow. You’re of more use to other people alive than dead. You need fear to survive (preferred indifference, again).

Also, if there is no state of nature (logos, or god), how can virtues be anything else other than potentially useful practices?
Stoicism needs to permeate with “logos” for virtues to be seen as the only good. Otherwise there’s no reason to be moral (if there are, the reasons are “its useful to me” which is egotistical in a sense)

"Day 1 of Stoicism, did well. Day 2 of Stoicism, truth bombs dropped and I feel horrible.","I have always been fascinated by different schools of studies and always knew stoicism to be one of the most practical ones out there. So after a lot of thought, introspection, questioning, and study, after around 5 months, I finally decided to pick up stoicism seriously and implement it in my life. Yesterday, I spent the whole day trying to gain as much knowledge as I can on the topic, making sure that I was as efficient as I can, and not cutting any corners. Today, I started taking action on it, not letting my emotions run rampant, and coming to terms with the existence of misery or social life as a stoic. 

&#x200B;

I also approached the girl that I've liked for the past 7 months and confessed how I felt to her with as much compassion and honesty as I could. As much as she was moved by it, I had to learn the harsh truth that she already has a boyfriend (2 years together). The whiplash of knowing it stayed for a second, but I kept my mind and thought before saying anything irrational as we spent almost an hour talking it out. I stayed as stoic, honest, and indifferent as I could. 

I know there's nothing I can do about this and the final result of what happened is totally out of my control, so I'm trying to let it go. As emotional of a person I am (I cry if I see someone else sad, I'm scared of even the stupidest things), I am proud to say I kept my composure. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

However, now I'm back home it's all slowly creeping in again. The lack of comfort, the feeling of knowing there's no hope, and knowing that there isn't anything I could've done, are making me feel powerless and weak. Stoicism says that I have the power over my mind and I decide how I feel, but I don't think I have. I'm trying to not be sad but sadness still finds its way in. (I'm 18 now, 19 soon, and throughout my 12 years of school and college life, I had never felt even the slightest bit of attraction to anyone till 7 months earlier, to this girl. Maybe it's the intensity of the time or something else but I just can't seem to let it go.) 

&#x200B;

I know this is exactly what Stoicism prepares you for, but I don't feel like I'm doing anything at all. By trying to let go of the feelings, I feel like I'm showing it down a barrel and ignoring it, waiting for it to come out exploding one day. A feeling knowing that no one else may ever come to make me feel safe or comfortable around like she did even if we were just friends, a thorn pushing its way in saying that I'll never be the way I want to be, or seeing her every single day smiling or laughing and thinking that those laughs and smiles could've been with me. None of this is under my control and I am absolutely aware of that. I know I must let them go but I can't seem to figure out how, and it's making me feel even worse than how I would've reacted to all this if I wasn't even following Stoicism and just cried my eyes out

But couldn't this concept of Stoicism go a bit further? Shouldn't we try to be as realistic as possible and add ""our opinions"" to what is neither good or bad? Shouldn't we just say everything good and bad is just a human invention? If we do this it seems to downplay the importance of virtue, unless we add some other supporting justification.

Don't just accept things but rather unconditionally and fanatically embrace everything,Treat the entire universe and the forces that created and sustain it as if it were your own.  Live vicariously through everything including yourself.  Because you treat all of reality as an extension of yourself you're desires become aligned with the way the universe unfolds as opposed to going against the grain and trying to change things beyond your control (which is futile).  I don't think acceptance of things is enough I'd argue that you must fanatically root for everything outside your control to unfold the way it does.  Embrace failure and struggle because you now identify with the totality of everything that unfolds instead of desire alone.

Why do so many men seem to be so stoic?,"UPDATE
Don't worry about this, I learnt that stoicism isn't suppressing emotion.

I don't understand why so many are like that.. I'm pretty lonely because I'm nothing like those kinds of guys (as in friendship, I'm straight), I'm a deep thinker, (who also over-thinks which is bad) and I'm nowhere near as sadistic as quite a few of them can be. Do they try to do it to be manly or something?? Its just weird, doesn't feel right and that they seem like quite mean people to me.. I cannot get along with those types of people well, my step-dad included.. I also wonder how they're so likeable compared to people like me if they aren't as emotionally available along with how they seem to not have much empathy.

I'm not a radical feminist or anything like that (in fact, I'm an anarchist) but I just really don't get the appeal of this. It seems disgusting and mean.",Stoicism,1531736322.0,t3_8z9r0l,0.5,0

I didn't know I fit stoicism to a T until today,"And I'm pretty excited... it makes sense that this is a philosophical way of thought but I never imagined it would be to this scope. 

If you don't mind me ranting and rambling a bit, let me tell you about myself. 

I am Chilean born, my parents brought me to the US illegally (unbeknownst to me) in the late 90s. Life was easy back then but after 9/11 a lot changed. Disappointment became a regular part of growing up as I wasn't able to take part in traveling field trips or competitions in high school, college past earning my AA seemed less than a dream. I married young, my high school sweetheart, both of us in hope to remedy my situation, but that soon turned sour too. My family since left, my marriage is was a nightmare I often remember, and after all of this the question I'm always asked is ""how do you do it?""

Till not I didn't know how to explain it. I would sometimes say ""well I'm still alive, so what choice do I have but to get over it?"" I rarely cry, maybe to a fault, I'm rarely able to get overwhelmed by a possibility because I know it could vanish., but I never knew that this was a way of life some people try to attain.

If anyone has some questions, feel free to ask, I've always been an open book of sorts. I'm pretty thrilled to see i finally have a name for how I think. People always made it seem like my thought processes were so depressing and I always brushed it off but it left me wondering if maybe I was missing out on something for not getting so overjoyed or upset at things. This is pretty cool guys.... I'm gonna ride this buzz as long as it lasts 😎",Stoicism,1500661793.0,t3_6opu7d,0.5,0
The law of opposites,"My bad if I'm breaking any rules, but I had a random thought I wanted to share (also, sorry if this is a repost of sorts).

Basically, the law is that whenever something can be described in an overwhelming manner, the opposite is true but in the most subtle of ways. 
eg. Someone who is always happy may be acting that way to hide the fact that they feel distraught inside.
Someone who is rich and spends carelessly actually has less because of their inability to monitor their finances.
Someone who commits wrongdoings might be doing it to help someone they love, or maybe this is the universe's roundabout way of getting you to appeal to the person inside them who wants to do right.

Again, sorry if this goes against and sub-rules, but I just wanted to share this.",Stoicism,1493741252.0,t3_68u1gh,0.5,0
Any fans of Tony Robbins here?,"Recently, I became fascinated with Tony Robbins. I haven't read any of his books yet but I've heard several hours of interviews and I noticed a few patters of thought popping up that remind of stoicism. 

One of the things that Tony says is that if you only had one week to live, you'd be able to enjoy the little things much more, so why not enjoy those things while you have more than a week to live? He defends that it's not the things that make you suffer but yourself. He defends that it's a choice to end your own suffering and also a choice when you do suffer. 

This reminded me so much of Stoicism because ""It is not things that disturb us, but our judgements about those things."" Also, just like Seneca wrote: ""it is not that life is short, but that we waste so much of it.""

Another central theme of Tony is that to have a truly good life you need to master the science of achievement (whether it is physical achievement or money or fame) but **also** master the art of fulfillment. He says often ""the ultimate failure is success without fulfillment.""

Again, this reminded me so much of how the Stoics view success: to them, the ultimate success is to have a great character, based on wisdom, courage, justice, and self-control. Only by having a great character can we feel fulfilled. Material wealth or a great body is not even related to our character, and the Stoics view this as external. Tony also says that of the two, it's better to feel fulfilled than to be successful. 

I was wondering if anybody here is also a fan of Tony Robbins and how that could have helped you become a Stoic or improved your life.",Stoicism,1471449588.0,t3_4y6egm,0.5,0
Come to /r/nonfictionbookclub for a group read of Walden by Henry David Thoreau.,"[Join us](https://www.reddit.com/r/nonfictionbookclub/comments/4sstud/and_the_winner_is_walden/) if u get the chance.

In Walden Henry talks about his time away from civilization and the busyness of life, to live a more simple one. A reading schedule will be up soon. I anticipate it relating to stoicism on at least some level.

Amazon Blurb:

Nature was a form of religion for naturalist, essayist, and early environmentalist Henry David Thoreau (1817–62). In communing with the natural world, he wished to ""live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and … learn what it had to teach."" Toward that end Thoreau built a cabin in the spring of 1845 on the shores of Walden Pond — on land owned by Ralph Waldo Emerson — outside Concord, Massachusetts. There he observed nature, farmed, built fences, surveyed, and wrote in his journal.

One product of his two-year sojourn was this book — a great classic of American letters. Interwoven with accounts of Thoreau's daily life (he received visitors and almost daily walked into Concord) are mediations on human existence, society, government, and other topics, expressed with wisdom and beauty of style.

Walden offers abundant evidence of Thoreau's ability to begin with observations on a mundane incident or the minutiae of nature and then develop these observations into profound ruminations on the most fundamental human concerns. Credited with influencing Tolstoy, Gandhi, and other thinkers, the volume remains a masterpiece of philosophical reflection.",Stoicism,1468705263.0,t3_4t6mrv,0.5,0

Natural Stoic?,"I have just recently found the stoic philosophy and realize I have been unknowingly living as a stoic since I was a young child! 

Here are a couple of examples!

When I was about 10 years old I learned that if I really wanted something if I focused on the thought of not getting it I was much more excited when I did eventually get it. For example my cousin would come and visit several times in the summer. I loved hanging out with him we always had a good time! As summer approached I would start to think about what summer would be like if he didn't visit.  Of course he did visit and I was grateful for it! I did the same when I wanted a toy or a new video game. I felt like it was my own magic power. I didn't always get what I wanted, but funny thing is I don't remember being disappointed that much when things didn't go my way. 

In my early teen years I started to play a game called ""what would I do if I were homeless"". I would think about where i would sleep when it got cold at night. Where I could get food from and actually come up with a plan for how I could make money. To this day I still play that game from time to time when traveling. My friends thought it was a very dark game and they didn't enjoy it nearly as much as I did.

The Benefits of Cold Showers.,"I’ll keep this brief. You wake up. You get your morning shower. Right at the end, after you’ve washed everything off, you turn that dial to the coldest it can go and you accept the icy water that rains down on your head and torso. You DO NOT think about it. You just DO. Why? Because you are becoming a man of action.

**THINK LESS; DO MORE.**

If you’re here, then perhaps you too overthink and ruminate - procrastinate too I imagine.

You get in that shower and you turn that dial **before you even have time to think**. Until it becomes a habit. Part of your morning routine.

The first time I started, I could only manage 10 seconds… on a good day! Then, as I continued ‘conquering my inner bitch’ and putting myself through it, it began to become euphoric… I now actually ENJOY the refreshing boost it gives me (no joke – when you’ve done your stint in the icy water, the feeling as you walk out and your body naturally begins to warm up is nothing short of amazing. Similar to that first sip of hot coffee on a cold day. An internally warming, all consuming warmth that envelopes your very soul).

I now do 30 seconds. Some days it’s hell. Some days it’s easy(ish). It doesn’t matter. **You accept it without judgement.** IT’S A MEDITATION. You give yourself to the act of throwing your body into something it’s screaming to get out of. You breathe - slow and deep. You wash the icy water over your body and you count in your head to 30 (or 10, 20… 100, whatever you can do eventually). Ancient samurai have always practiced this ancient technique, standing under icy waterfalls for long periods. It is the ultimate meditation. Your body is screaming at you to GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE! … but you don’t. YOU are in charge. Not your body. Not your desire. Not your urges. YOU are the master of your fate… the captain of your soul.

Start sacrificing yourself to the cold. Watch how your motivation and discipline skyrockets.

EDIT: Apologies if I’ve been misinterpreted, but I still feel this is 100% in line with Stoic philosophy. If my rhetoric has been misjudged, then I accept if some out there judge it as machismo. I am simply referring to the fact that no human wants to willingly place themselves in discomfort and to learn to do so (act rather than ruminating over how uncomfortable it will be, thus ‘conquering your inner bitch’ - not a reference to any gender, but the part of oneself who strives for comforts - again, dispensing of which is completely in line with stoic philosophy) will allow a person to accept the cold water as just that, cold water and momentary discomfort. This will in turn, allow them to live stoically rather than just reading about the great philosophers from a place of comfort.

I fully believe that this then allows a person to take this lesson with them throughout any other hardships as they have succeeded already in their day and not much can be as intensely discomforting as that icy water… yet still they go on. Mastering their mind and body. r/samuraimindset",Stoicism,1675635523.0,t3_10upbk6,0.78,322
How do you cope with other's opinions,"I recently took to stoicism and it's principles. This was since February 2023. I have been working on myself physically, mentally and emotionally.

I have made amends to that relationship as best as possible later. But this particular person seems to enjoy picking me apart. I care for this person and I cryptically suggested that they reflect on their feelings and find out if they were going wrong in some way. Then they proceeded to rip me apart while poking on my insecurities. I have come to grips with that after some time. But they mentioned that I have this way of thinking wherein I feel that I am superior to everyone around me. Is sharing an opinion that you have wrong?

Ryan Holiday Reading From Anything…,"Sorry this is old news but can we talk about Ryan Holiday?

Half-Sister [50F] reached out to me [42M]: Turns out she's racist and transphobic. How do I empathically and assertively reply?,"TLDR: Half-sister wants to connect but she's clearly got racist and transphobic attitudes that I don't want to just ignore. Do I work with her on it, ask her to just not say that stuff to me, or slam the door, or is there another way?

My dad quite likely got a girlfriend pregnant about a year or two before meeting my mum, though both mum and dad both died 8 years ago. The daughter, ""Rachel"", actually reached out to him by letter when I was a teen. They told us 4 kids about it, but to my disappointment they didn't continue contact with her (as far as I know).

She recently reached out to us 4 siblings to get to know us, and we've talked about getting paternity testing for peace of mind. I'm pretty sure she's our dad's daughter, but as a loner introvert I (and one brother) would prefer empirically knowing before investing in a whole new relationship.

She currently lives overseas with her husband and visited my country last year with a view to moving back here. There wasn't time for either parties to meet in person, but in her summary of her trip she said ""I""m not racist but..."" and then talked about one of the major cities as having ""too many <nationality>, <nationality>, <religion>"", them being rude and hard to get to know, and ""it felt like being in <other nation>"".

She also talked about wanting to move to one of the country towns where ""it's easy to get to know people there and they're so nice and it's just like being back in the old times"".

She's also has previously talked about people that are transexual as not being the gender they're transitioned to, using sports and genetics as her arguments. In that conversation I talked about the variety of sex characteristics, the discrimination that even cis people get for not showing them all, and I tried expressing empathy about the struggles of people that transition or are transitioning.

I tried gentle challenging rather than being confrontational, though it seemed like she held her opinions very strongly. She concluded that we'd ""agree to disagree"".

On the plus side, she's expressed being bisexual, doing some casual drag, and shows no homophobia to my sexuality. But with this additional issue, she clearly yearns for living in a location with little racial or gender diversity, and I can see that I probably can't change her values about her racism and transphobia any time soon.

I personally want to behave according to my principles of compassion, integrity, courage, and truth. I also don't have the energy or time to try empathising with her through these horrible attitudes with the hope that she'll someday open her heart and mind to people different to her.

How do I assertively reply to this while standing by my values?

EDIT:  I forgot to mention Justice as a principle. I'm wondering if there are there any references to virtuous use of time that would also help with figuring out how much to commit to these unjust attitudes and this relationship overall?
